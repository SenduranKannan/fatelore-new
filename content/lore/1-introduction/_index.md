Fate/Starry Night is a narrative roleplay based in Discord and set in the world of Fate.

Though canonical events up to the 2004 Fuyuki Grail War remain mostly identical, this worldline diverges at this crucial junction into an originally crafted setting irrevocably altered by a worldwide flood that has forced humanity to survive atop massive floating Nomadic Cities. As it was crucial for Science and Magecraft to come together to survive this calamity, the mystics of the world have been revealed to the common man, a momentous decision that has produced no shortage of change and advancements, such as the invention of Artificial Circuits that allow for ordinary citizens to process magical energy, and more notably, a stream-lined process of summoning Heroic Spirits at a scale that has since seen them integrated into daily society.

The world is vast, with each city a grand stage for secrets and adventures to explore.
