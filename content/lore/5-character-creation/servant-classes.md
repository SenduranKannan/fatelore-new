# Berserker
{{< columns img-left medium >}}
![](../media/berserker.jpg) Applicable Heroic Spirits are those who are known to have gone berserk in battle. Though hard to control, they have unwavering determination.

Possesses the Madness Enhancement skill, which allows a Heroic Spirit to surpass their normal limits - gaining overwhelming strength in exchange for their sanity. As such, this class can strengthen Heroic Spirits with low stats. But when used by an inherently powerful Heroic Spirit, the result is a fearsome foe indeed.
