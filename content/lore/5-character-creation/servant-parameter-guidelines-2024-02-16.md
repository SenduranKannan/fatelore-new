# Strength

**Rank E** - Lacking Servant

Servants of this rank usually include those suffering from frail health and those possessing the physical capabilities of a human. Servants at this level are generally averse to direct physical confrontations, often because they lack tales of notable physical prowess, sometimes even being remembered for their lack of physical strength or combat experience instead. This category typically includes the physically weak or those unacquainted with the battlefield, Servants whose skills simply align with other fields.

**Rank D** - Average Servant

This rank denotes a level of physical ability that is adequate, or perhaps even expected for close-quarters combat. It represents Servants who are capable combatants, albeit not particularly distinguished by their physical strength. These heroes might instead have been known for their agility or were simply not celebrated for overwhelming physical strength. At this level combat is plausible, with an emphasis on technique over sheer force. This rank could include individuals akin to an average, trained soldier and warriors martial training and battle experience.

**Rank C** - Impressive Servant

At Rank C one is well-suited for melee engagements, offering a respectable, though not extraordinary, level of strength for a Servant. Heroes at this level are celebrated for their martial accomplishments, capable of feats that verge on the supernatural, such as effortlessly lifting vehicles and breaking through walls with a single swing of their weapon. This rank includes the typical heroic figures one might find in folktales and legends.

**Rank B** - Legendary Servant

This rank is characterized by remarkable strength, making it ideal for frontline combat. Heroes with this classification are renowned for their formidable physical capabilities, supported by widespread tales of their extraordinary deeds. Their power allows them to strike with a force that can shatter steel and uproot trees, any fight they're involved in now at great risk of having its landscape irrevocably altered. This Rank is reserved for the most legendary figures, known for incredible feats of strength, and mythical beings that easily surpass human limits.

**Rank A** - Apex Servant

At this rank, a Servant's strength is akin to a force of nature, marked by legendary feats such as vanquishing formidable adversaries with minimal effort or challenging the gods and living to tell the tale. This tier is reserved for only the greatest of legendary heroes and mythical entities, easily capable of toppling buildings and surpassing the realm of possibility with their sheer might alone.

# Endurance

**Rank E** - Lacking Servant

At this level, Servants exhibit a notably low degree of resilience, ranging from those struggling to perform basic everyday movements to those barely able to withstand a single solid blow in battle. Their bodies are fragile, offering minimal resistance to force, and are especially vulnerable to being on the receiving end of injury. One might find among this rank those who are gravely ill or lack any form of combat training.

**Rank D** - Average Servant

Endurance at this rank implies an acceptable level of resilience. Servants can endure numerous attacks without succumbing to their injuries, capable of sustaining prolonged combat without showing signs of fatigue. Though not perfect, this level of toughness is well-suited melee engagement, particularly when complemented by superior agility and tactical skill. Expected among those who expect to suffer wounds or survive harsh conditions and still expect to function.

**Rank C** - Impressive Servant

A suitably formidable Rank, those with Rank C Endurance boast robust physical toughness suitable for specialized melee fighters. Such Servants possess a resilience comparable to light armor, far surpassing ordinary human limits, and more closely resemble action heroes capable of enduring multiple gunshots without faltering and persisting on sheer will alone. Notable for their enduring presence in battle, these heroes might have overcome crippling injuries or poisoning and lived to tell the tale.

**Rank B** - Legendary Servant

This Rank is reserved for those with exceptional durability, proving the Servant to be an indomitable bulwark, a wall of hardened flesh and bone capable of surviving the onslaught of enemy assaults. Ideal for frontline combat, such individuals no doubt present a daunting challenge for their adversaries to take down, pillars of resilience no strangers to enduring continuous relentless punishment. Reserved for legendary figures capable of battling tirelessly for days or withstanding the might of entire armies.

**Rank A** - Apex Servant

At this Rank durability crosses over into legendary status, attainable only by those whose perseverance is composed as much of a mental fortitude as it is of physical toughness. The Servant's body functions akin to armor, rendering additional protection nearly redundant against lesser attacks. Reserved for the most iconic legends, these individuals could very likely endure critical injuries that would spell death for anybody else and persist for long enough to see their task to an end.

# Agility

**Rank E** - Lacking Servant

The lowest Rank, characterized by struggling to effectively react to attacks and having limited mobility, leaving a Servant noticeably slower and sluggish than their counterparts. Servants at this rank typically rely on superior strength and resilience to compensate for their lack of speed, or simply lack an affinity for physical combat and instead specialize in thaumaturgy of unconventional methods of attack. It is common for Servants at this Rank to require assistance when having to cross long distances under pursuit barely, only able to intercept slow-moving objects in their field of view.

**Rank D** - Average Servant

An adequate level of nimbleness and speed, sufficient for engagement, but not particularly extraordinary by heroic standards. Servants at this rank can maneuver combat effectively, and are often supported by complementary skills and matching physical strength. This rank is home to experienced soldiers and warriors to whom the field of battle is a stranger no longer.

**Rank C** - Impressive Servant

Those at Rank C exhibit notable feats of Agility, this being when one begins to display superhuman capabilities. Servants at this rank can perform actions that surpass human perception and execute decisions with remarkable precision and swiftness. This is the realm of the extraordinary, and it isn't uncommon to find those capable of delivering multiple strikes within seconds at this level.

**Rank B** - Legendary Servant

Restricted to those with exceptional speed, even for Servants standards, allowing for near-instantaneous reflexes and acrobatics that seem to defy the laws of gravity. Projectiles become much less effective, and a Servant's maneuverability allows for them to avoid, deflect, or lessen the damage inflicted by most attacks. Such Agility is often the product of grandiose tales of one's dexterity.

**Rank A** - Apex Servant

The absolute peak of superhuman speed, attributed only to the swiftest of heroes, mythical beasts, and deities. Servants who have reached this rank exhibit unparalleled Agility and reflexes, making them nearly invisible to both humans and many Servants, the distinction between close and mid-range combat becoming meaningless as they are able to cross that distance with little to no effort. This level of Agility is often associated with the divine or the innate abilities attributed to legendary creatures and those bearing their influence.

# Mana

**Rank E** - Lacking Servant

This rank is indicative of a scarce capacity for magical energy, commonly found in heroes whose legends did not involve magic or supernatural elements, relying predominantly on physical strength. Such Servants face significant limitations, such as being unable to sustain their Physical Form when cut off from a steady supply of energy, betraying their dependence on their Master.

**Rank D** - Average Servant

Somewhat average reserves, neither a detriment nor a boon, but ultimately reliable. Although Servants at this Rank wouldn't exactly be called adept in regards to energy management, they are at a level where they could reliably invoke their Noble Phantasm and Personal Skills without relying entirely upon their Master's supply, those Noble Phantasms are yet limited by those that have proven themselves to be relatively cost-efficient. A Master cutting off their supply of energy still cripples their fighting abilities, leaving them only a short time before being forced into Spirit Form.

**Rank C** - Impressive Servant

Remarkable reserves for a Servant. Very prevalent among the Servants whose myth and legend includes elements of the magical and phantasmal. They possess a considerable reservoir of magical energy and are particularly capable at commanding it, or alternatively, a Servant could simply possess a wealthspring of magical energy with the inability to effectively channel it. A Master cutting off their supply of energy no longer cripples them, though they would still suffer from certain restrictions, making it impossible for the Servant to fight at their best for an extended period of time. In such circumstances, shouldering the burden of a Noble Phantasm may spell no small amount of risk.

**Rank B** - Legendary Servant

Extraordinary reserves, the Servantâ€™s circuits are either extremely numerous, of high quality and efficiency, or any combination of the three. Liberal use of abilities is now a given, and even costly Noble Phantasms can now be deployed without worry. Such heroes are often marked by supernatural or mystical elements in their myth, perhaps even benefiting from rare magical heritage, and are very likely to have some mastery in the realm of magecraft. A Master cutting off the supply of their energy, while inconvenient, does not pose too much of a hurdle to overcome in the short-term if push comes to shove, although safety cannot be guaranteed for what comes after. Forced to rely only on their own reserves, Servants at this Rank can fight at maximum capacity for quite a while.

**Rank A** - Apex Servant

The Rank of those who possess a staggering amount of magical energy, enough to be considered absurd even by the standards of legendary heroes. It is possible to take advantage of this overwhelming reservoir and relentlessly bombard one's opponent with powerful spells, Personal Skills, or Noble Phantasms so long as they are suited for an assault of this kind. This Rank is most common among prestigious mages and spellcasters, although it isn't unheard of for some warriors and those to whom traditional magic is foreign to also achieve this Rank. At this rank, as long as the contract with a Master exists, even should the Master cut off their support, a Servant's abilities will not be noticeably affected.

# Luck

**Rank E** - Lacking Servant

Luck befitting heroes who were the victims of fate and the God's whims in their life. Even if such fate was resisted, it is more than likely that they met their demise in some tragic manner.

**Rank D** - Average Servant

No longer destiny's plaything, yet still someone whose life has been streaked with misfortune. Although an improvement from Rank E, Servants of this Rank still ultimately lacked the strength and agency to shape the path awaiting them, simply fulfilling their part as one cog amongst many. This Parameter offers little to no protection against abilities that rely on chance, and one should not expect to be granted a boon of great luck.

**Rank C** - Impressive Servant

A Rank at which Servants have suffered little to no meddling in their lives by supernatural forces, whether that be for the better or for worse, experiencing equal measure of success and failure when charting their own path and defying expectation. Servants with this level of Luck will not be inconvenienced or singled out by misfortune, but neither are they likely from unlikely interferences that could save their life.

**Rank B** - Legendary Servant

A phenomenal capacity to defy fate. Servants at this Rank are likely to have lived a blessed life, or alternatively, have carved out their own success and fortune in the face of constant defiance, overcoming even the unlikeliest of odds. Not necessarily a sign of a life free of hardship, but such hardships most likely ended up being a necessary obstacle on a journey gravitating towards success. Under certain circumstances, one is likely to receive positive modifiers that contribute towards bending chance in one's favor.

**Rank A** - Apex Servant

Extraordinary luck. It is extremely likely, if not implied, that a Servant at this Rank was most certainly blessed and dearly loved by the divine, or simply fate itself. Power and talent may come to them on a silver platter, the triumph over certain loss and death no longer a miracle, but a matter of fact. Such a life does not guarantee a glorious end however, as such radiant tales of heroism only invite a tragic end all the more. Luck of this rank is a truly powerful asset.
