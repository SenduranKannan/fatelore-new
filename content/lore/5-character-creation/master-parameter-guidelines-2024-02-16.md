# Strength

**Rank E** - Average Human

Rank E is the domain of the ordinary. At this level one may be capable of crushing a can with their foot or lift heavy furniture with some effort, though this Rank also covers those who are infirm and weak; those who are bedridden or otherwise unable to perform physical tasks. Not particularly healthy, but not particularly unhealthy either.

**Rank D** - Formidable Human

Rank D includes those that train regularly and keep in shape, whether the be as a hobby or due to the nature of one's occupation. At this level one can reliably enter competitions and perform passably, and includes people that are part of a sports club or are in a position where they can perform physically demanding tasks, such as lifting heavy objects. People at this rank are physically fit, and in its upper reaches even includes those that have dedicated themselves to disciplined training, though they still fall short of true experts, whether that be due to lacking age or talent, or both.

**Rank C** - Peak Human

Rank C describes the pinnacle of human ability, or at the very least, natural human ability. This is the domain of olympic athletes and martial artists that have spent their whole life refining their techniques. At this level one is capable of performing incredible feats of strength that would be unheard of for most anybody else, and are confident to be unmatched in a contest of pure physical might. These are people that have honed themselves to the utmost.

**Rank B** - Enhanced Human

Rank B is ordinarily impossible to achieve by the human body alone, and is the domain only reachable by magical and alchemical enhancements. As such, thought mages may have an inherent strength much weaker than this, they are still capable of achieving this rank via Reinforcement, tampering, or other alternative enhancements. At this level one is capable of shattering stone, tearing through wood, or inflict lethal wounds on an opponent a single well-aimed strike. Combatants capable of comfortable operating at this level are fearsome indeed and usually belong to Executioners, Sealing Designation Enforcers, or other specialists, the upper limit for this Rank enough to hold one's own even against Servants. At the lower this still includes ordinary mages too, those who perform rudimentary strengthening to leap over walls or dash at impossible speeds.

**Rank A** - Inhuman

Rank A encroaches on the realm at which one ceases to be human, requiring uncompromising excellence and a complimentary magical skillset to reach at all, though even then it is highly unlikely. Let alone mages, even some inhumans have not even attained this level of strength, enough to bring down an entire building and stand on equal footing with hardened Servants. It is highly unlikely for most to reach this level in the modern era.

# Endurance

**Rank E** - Average Human

Rank E represents the standard human capacity to endure physical exertions and injury. Individuals at this level will tire from routine activities like running a short distance or engaging in moderate physical labor, like moving furniture around to redecorate their room. This rank includes those who lead peaceful uneventful lives that never exposed them to harsh trauma or injury. Bumping one's knee will hurt, slap to the face will disorient, and any excessive pain is likely to cause one to lose consciousness.

**Rank D** - Formidable Human

Rank D includes those that regularly exercise, exposing their bodies to the satisfaction of hard work and the pain of muscle aches. This includes athletes engaged in regular training and individuals with demanding physical jobs. They can maintain physical activity for extended periods and are no strangers to work related injuries, or the many scrapes and cuts from spending a lot of time in the outdoors, having probably suffered from a pulled muscle, sprained ankle, or perhaps even an unluckily broken bone or two. Due to their body's health they seldom get sick and are quick to heal from any injuries they may incur. Their tolerance for pain and adverse conditions is notably higher than that of an average person, even quite impressive at times.

**Rank C** - Peak Human

At Rank C one will encounter those pushing the limits of human endurance, most commonly soldiers having put through harsh conditioning to withstand even the most unforgiving conditions, star athletes that regularly bring their bodies to the brink, and warriors that have had more than one brush with death. This is the accumulation of years of effort, now rewarded with the ability to stave off fatigue and stress, refusing to be distracted in pursuit of their goal. At this level one's body is sturdy and formidable, brimming with vitality and able to overcome great agony.

**Rank B** - Enhanced Human

This rank is beyond the natural human limit, attainable only through magical, alchemical, or other supernatural enhancements. Individuals at this level can withstand extreme temperatures, survive lethal injuries, and continue fighting despite critical conditions that would incapacitate a normal human. Their recovery from wounds is accelerated, often through magical means, making them formidable opponents in prolonged engagements.

**Rank A** - Inhuman

Rank A is a domain where endurance transcends human boundaries, requiring not only exceptional physical conditioning but also significant magical augmentation, and even then it is debatable whether that alone is enough. Individuals at this level can survive conditions that would be instantly fatal to others, such as having a hole gouged through their chests or even being burned alive. Their bodies recover from wounds at an unbelievably rapid rate, though under specific circumstances damage to the flesh may not even classify as 'injury' at all. This level of endurance is obscene, seen in beings who have blurred the line between human and something else entirely.

# Agility

**Rank E** - Average Human

Rank E represents the standard human capacity for movement and reflexes. Individuals at this level can perform everyday tasks at a comfortable pace, and may or may not accidentally knock over their glass when wiping down their table. Their reaction time is average, allowing them to catch or dodge thrown objects in view, but those thrown with violent intent may prove a challenge to intercept reliably. This rank includes most people who live routine, ordinary lives.

**Rank D** - Formidable Human

Individuals with Rank D Agility commonly engage in activities that improve their reflexes and coordination, such as sports or training. They can execute movements with impressive speed and precision, react quickly to unexpected surprises, and perform demanding physical tasks with hardly any effort. They are more likely to outrun a purse-snatcher than fall prey to their ill-intent.

**Rank C** - Peak Human

Rank C is the pinnacle of human agility, where individuals exhibit extraordinary speed, reflexes, and coordination. This level is dominated by professional athletes and expert martial artists who can perform awe-inspiring feats, dodge attacks with minimal movement, and strike with incredible precision. Their reaction times are significantly faster than the average human, allowing them to respond instantaneously to threats or opportunities even if reacting slightly late to an attack.

**Rank B** - Enhanced Human

Beyond the natural limits. Rank B Agility is achieved through supernatural means, such as magic or advanced technology. Individuals at this level can move at speeds that blur to the human eye, perform leaps and maneuvers that defy physics, and react to events so fast that one might mistake it for natural instinct. Their movements are fluid and precise, enabling them to navigate through chaotic battlefields with ease or evade attacks targeted at them from multiple opponents.

**Rank A** - Inhuman

At Rank A, one's Agility reaches a level incomprehensible to humans, with movements and reflexes that reach levels of unbelievability. These individuals can reach speeds reserved to Servant combatants, dodge attacks at point-blank range, and retaliate against an opponent's attack before theirs has even landed, given the right circumstances. Their control over their movements is exemplary, allowing them to navigate any environment or situation with unparalleled grace and efficiency. This level of agility is rare and typically reserved for those that have discarded their humanity, willingly or otherwise, or those heavily augmented by exceptional magecraft.

# Mana

**Rank E** - Average Human

Civilians. Although they may or may not possess Magic Circuits, they at the very least possess their own personal stores of Od, their vitality and life's energy, even if they possibly lack the means to process it. This Rank also includes those born with the capacity to do magecraft yet were never taught or lacked the ability to develop their talents, but it is usually more likely that those at this level are oblivious to magecraft entirely.

**Rank D** - Formidable Human

Rank D encompasses most early students of magecraft, those with a solid grasp on the fundamentals while still lacking the ability to perform more complex spells without assistance. Though one may know the process in theory, the practice of it may be difficult to execute when even the conversion and production of magical energy requires some degree of effort. It is possible to have mastered a straight-forward spell or two and have already chosen a preference for a specific field of magecraft aligned with one's attribute. At higher levels one may encounter a competent mage showing great promise, though nurturing such talent still requires time, effort, and perseverance.

**Rank C** - Peak Human

Rank C is usually attained by those that have graduated from the Clocktower, or those with the ability to stand toe-to-toe with them, perhaps even surpass them depending on their thaumaturgical foundation. Continued practice and repetition is often not enough, and a certain degree of luck is near essential to ensure one is born with sufficient quantity and quality of magic circuits to facilitate one's spellcraft. This Rank ranges from graduates that have proven excellence, to those simply born gifted, and even includes the rare mage who has gone above and beyond to refine their gift to the utmost.

**Rank B** - Enhanced Human

Pushing the boundary of what is possible, and unattainably by those not born with the potential. This Tier of mages may not necessarily be composed of those that studiously adhered to their teachings, as this is the realm of the abnormal. Those born with twisted Origins, possessed of unnatural Mystic Eyes, or even those whose essence has been magically altered by phantasmal entities. While it is still possible for 'ordinary' mages to reach this level if particularly gifted, the ability to remain ordinary at this level of magical excellence is in itself an oddity. More often than not, those that have attained this Rank did so by bending a few rules.

**Rank A** - Inhuman

A Rank deemed impossible to reach through modern efforts alone. True Mages don't fall into this category, the only classification appropriate for their incomprehensible existence being that of Rank EX, though this still includes those capable of the impossible, even if such feats require the most unlikely of circumstances and conditions. This includes mages capable of plucking the stars from the sky, as well as beast and Phantasmals capable of bending the very laws of the natural world. It may be possible to temporarily command powers equal to this Rank under the right circumstances, such as when commanding the vast energies of a Holy Grail or similar mystical artifacts, but those instances should not be counted as the norm.
