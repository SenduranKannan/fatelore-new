Alexandria, also known as the New World’s Archive, is a massive *data center and information hub* that was created for the sole purpose of preserving the history of mankind. It houses the world's largest, most up-to-date database, as well as public libraries, museums and warehouses full of books and artifacts that are available for rental.

Alexandria's only goal is to archive human history. It does not meddle in political affairs, nor does it seek to use its information network for monetary gains. As such, it manages to maintain a *neutral and amicable* relationship with most major factions, especially those who are open to information exchange.

The faction consists of a single Stella Maris city as its main operational base, along with multiple smaller-scale library cities across the world as its subsidiary. 

Within the city are several notable infrastructures and functions that hold significance within the RP.

# The Librarians

Much like how money begets power in Delphi and how lineage begets prestige in Olympia, Alexandria is a city built by librarians, for librarians. Library enthusiasts make great use of the city’s resources as well, such as historians, archaeologists, scientists, engineers, or anyone who is fascinated by the Old World’s records. All funds are spent towards the betterment of the city’s many archives. In turn, Alexandria uses knowledge as leverage to attract various talents. As a result, the libraries of Alexandria hold the utmost prestige over any other organization within the borders of the city.

Thus, it follows naturally that if there is any group of people that could be considered the governing body of Alexandria, it would be the librarians. They are those tasked to manage the city’s enormous library, ranging from the collection and preservation of various types of medium to the handling of different sectors of its giant library network. 

As an example, one librarian might be tasked to handle the section of the library that holds historical journals from X date to Y, while another might handle a section containing Magecraft and incantation papers. 

The work of a librarian requires great organization skills and diligence. Therefore, the requirements to be a librarian are rather high, since one cannot afford to allow untrained hands to ruin the world’s last remaining information hub. As a result, all applicants undergo lengthy training, complete with a rigorous exam that involves both written and practical portions in order to qualify. Some people are also grandfathered in by parents or relatives who were former librarians.

Only qualified librarians are allowed to work in the libraries. Though the requirement is somewhat relaxed for museums, galleries, and other heritage institutions, which oftentimes employ people in other professions as their staff. As for Servants, the majority of them serve an advisory role in the fields they are most qualified for.

As Alexandria handles large amounts of information daily, many of which are confidential in nature, the librarians that work in related sectors are required to undertake an oath to never leave the city under any circumstances. A strict screening process is used to hire people in those positions. Because of this, many librarians in Alexandria come from families that have supported the city for generations. They can even be considered the ‘true’ natives of the city.

## Librarian Duties
Librarians working in different sectors have different responsibilities, including but not limited to:

- Collecting various record storing mediums from other cities. These can range from anything from written, printed materials to digital materials. Considered to be low risk, though often requires a certain amount of tact.

- Recovering S.E.R.V.A.N.T. cores and dangerous artifacts from other cities for safekeeping. The deal is often prearranged, though sometimes persuasion is necessary. Staff sent on these jobs are often required to achieve a certain level of competence in Magecraft for self preservation.

- Translation, transcription, copywriting, and tasks related to the handling of printed materials that have become too fragile for storage. Cumbersome as the jobs are, many staff working in these sectors have become proper hermits.

- Restoring damaged artifacts and recovering information from damaged mediums. The skill floor is quite high for staff in these sectors. They may also need to specialize in a few niches.

- General operations, such as working at the reception, help desk, and ensuring the smooth running of the libraries and other institutions. Depending on the location, these jobs could range from low to high risk.

- Research. Staff usually work with the various academic and research facilities in the area to foster various tools and technologies that assist with record keeping or record retrieval. Has become quite popular ever since the recovery of Nirvana’s journal in 2104.

- Managing the Servant Catalyst Archives and ensuring the safekeeping of the catalysts. Works in strict confidentiality. Need to have a great sense of direction. Need to be good at running, biking, and riding mana rails to chase down petty thieves.

- Moderators of FateChan™. Quite the stressful job. Staff could often be seen complaining about spams and flame wars, most of which are caused by a certain anonymous individual who can’t stop posting bird pics and a group of the world’s most pompous literary Servants who insist on signing each post with their real names. Some of the names have become quite notorious among the moderators, who have trained their fingers to delete their posts on reflex alone.

# The Great Library of Alexandria

The famous lone white tower stands in the center of a circular lake. Housing the world’s largest collection of print material and digital databases, the Great Library of Alexandria is a scholar’s heaven and a popular tourist spot for Alexandria’s visitors. The materials are organized based on their type of medium, level of access, subject, and authorship. They are not organized by language, so the user is expected to produce their own means of translation when browsing foreign texts. 

An observatory takes over the top floor of the tower, with the floors immediately below them dedicated to astronomers and astrologers who are interested in the studying of planetary movements. 

The basement floors generally tend to the storage of digital mediums, some of which have restricted access to unauthorized personnel due to housing important databases such as the ServantPedia.


# The Servant Catalyst Archives

The Servant Catalyst Archives is, as its name implies, a collection of catalysts that has a high chance of guaranteeing the summoning of specific Servants. It is the largest collection of its kind, thanks to the tireless, and almost obsessive efforts of Alexandria's citizens who worked to retrieve the catalysts from all over the world.

These catalysts include artifacts that have been recovered from the flood, traded, or gifted. Ever since the S.E.R.V.A.N.T frames have been perfected, the retrieval of deactivated Servant Cores have also become a viable way to expand the collection.

Rather than a single vault, the Archives is actually a dedicated *network* that connects to numerous locations, where they each store a portion of the catalysts. The locations can range anywhere from an actual vault, to the storeroom of a museum, to an inconspicuous flower pot filled with fake plants on the counter of a local café. 

Alexandria is always happy to lend its collection to people who need them for a good cause. It also accepts trades of no lesser value. However, rarer catalysts need clearance from the head librarians, which almost always includes an extensive interview and a background check.

Once the user has been cleared, the network will arrange for the shipment of their desired catalyst. Under no circumstances can the storage location of the catalyst be disclosed to an unauthorized individual.

In order to satisfy the public's curiosity, high quality replicas of rare artifacts are usually distributed to museums, galleries, and other institutions for public display. From time to time, thievery is attempted on these replicas, leading to amusing headlines on the newspaper in the following day.

# ServantPedia™ Head Offices & Main Database

The ServantPedia head office is located in Alexandria. It maintains the most updated version of the Servant database. A *master copy*, if you will. 

All modifications made to Servant pages must be peer-reviewed by at least one staff member, even if said modification was made by a user in a different city. This is to prevent malicious edits.

However, the system is not infallible. Skilled hackers and Servants can sometimes bypass security checks to gain access to the database. Thankfully, Alexandria has its own team of technicians and Servants to set up countermeasures, aiming to keep the data loss to a minimum.

# Fatechan™ Imageboard

Fatechan is an imageboard service hosted by Alexandria and moderated by librarians. It is the *only social platform that works worldwide*. Alexandria being its host gave Fatechan much credibility, as it is allowed access in every functional city’s City Wide Web. 

Moreover, the simplistic nature of an imageboard limits the types of data that can be posted (texts and images). This cuts down the cost of data transmission, allowing users of Fatechan to stay up to date with the latest posts even in the farthest reaches of the world.
