# Repulic & Neo Holy Empire Frames

Up until Season 3.5, all S.E.R.V.A.N.T frames used within the RP have been *Republic frames*.

Starting from Season 4, *Church frames* have also been introduced. Compared to Republic, the Neo Holy Empire has been working with a completely different dataset, and thus, both organizations have made different breakthroughs in their tech. Because of this, the Church frames are lacking certain features that are present on Republic frames, but make up for it with features that Republic frames lack in converse.


# Republic Frames

## Serial Number & Kill Switch

Each Servant summoned into a Republic Frame can be tracked using the *unique serial number* assigned to each frame. They can also be **forced to shut down** via _Republic's_ central network that monitors these Mystic Codes. This essentially works as a **kill switch** that allows an authorized personnel to disable the Mystic Code, effectively killing the Servant.

A Master has access to said kill switch **only if they have bonded with the servant** and gained access to the serial number on the Mystic Code's core. Once they have bonded with the Servant, Republic loses access to the Servant’s serial number. Otherwise, management of said servant is done via Republic's central network.

**Once initiated, deactivation via the kill switch cannot be revoked. It is the highest privilege granted to the Master who has bonded with the Servant.**

A Servant can, however, technically escape the kill signal by leaving the city they inhabit and avoiding contact with a city's radio waves. However, this is merely a temporary solution, since cities are the only locations in the world where one can obtain mana batteries. In a sense, they would be dooming themselves to a slow death since they cannot absorb atmospheric mana and lack a Master.

## Command Spells?

As of now, `Republic frames` are unable to generate Command Spells upon summoning a Servant. The processor chip's 10% of the Grail's data simply does not include this necessary function.

Without this safety feature, Servant summons have become even more of a double edged sword. Clear, effective communication is more vital than ever, as the Servant is no longer forced to obey their Master and could easily turn on them at the drop of a hat. As a result, the only ways to exercise some degree of control over a summoned Servant is via their **mana intake and the kill switch**.

Despite _Republic's_ various research departments pouring vast amounts of resources into the endeavor, progress has been slow and no noticeable improvements have been made. In place of Command Spells remains only a crude alternative that aims to mimic the same role at controlling a summoned Servant: **Bonding**.

On the other hand, `Church frames` are able to generate three strokes of Command Spells upon the successful summoning of a Servant, but are missing other coveted functions of a Republic frame due to possessing a different 10% of the Grail data.

## Bonding

Arguably, the most unique feature that comes with a Republic Frame is its ability to *bond* with a Master.

It is possible for anyone (including commoners) to forge a connection with a Servant's processor core this way, so long as the following conditions have been met:

1.  The potential Master has installed **artificial magic circuits** on their body, which are used to sync up to the processor core to establish an initial connection.
2.  The Servant in question isn't bonded to anyone else at the moment.

The bond grants the master unrestricted access to the processor core's *serial number* and by extension, the ***kill switch*** that can permanently shut down the Servant unit. This protocol bypasses any defensive mechanism the Servant may set up to prevent their shutdown, and overrides any command issued by the head company monitoring the Servant via their central network.

The act of bonding itself varies, depending on the traits of the Servant. Some Servants demand specific types of actions to form a connection, which is usually tied to their myth or their feats. As such, there is no universal way to perform a bond and it is a case-by-case basis. Because of this, some Masters forego bonding altogether, in case they do not fit the Servant's criteria.

The bonding process is left vague on purpose. It’s entirely up to the writer’s interpretation and dependent on the Servant in question. Some Servants can bond via a simple formal agreement, such as a contract or a verbal vow, while others require more complicated methods such as a blood pact or a sacrifice.

### Severing the Bond (Republic Frame Exclusive)

There are multiple ways to sever an established bond:

1.  Deactivating the Servant via its kill switch (initiated by the Master).
2.  Destroying the Master's artificial mana circuits (initiated by anyone).
3.  Killing the Servant and/or master (initiated by anyone).

After severing the bond, a Servant is able to bond with a new Master provided that they still live. A Master is able to bond with a new Servant **provided that their artificial mana circuits have not been damaged**.

### Risks of Severing the Bond

Severing the bond places great strain on a Master's artificial magic circuits, which they used to forge the bond. The damage caused is dependent on the location of said artificial circuit.

In addition, severing a bond will plague the current Master with memories of the Servant's previous Masters in the form of severe hallucinations, a condition labeled as **Erosion** by current day researchers. Prevention of this backflow of memory is impossible. Prediction of when the hallucinations will hit is impossible. Prolonged exposure to these hallucinations may have negative consequences on a Master's day-to-day life. Suppressants in the form of pills can alleviate the symptoms somewhat, but they will never truly go away.

Therefore, Magi and Commoners are generally ill-advised to contract with a Servant via bonding _unless they have adequately steeled themselves for the consequences_. Likewise, if you see a stray Servant in a cardboard box on the side of the street begging for a new owner and/or mana batteries, please call the Servant Shelter Hotline at **xxx-xxxx** to arrange a retrieval service instead.



# Neo Holy Empire (Church) Frames

The most notable difference between Republic Frames and Church Frames are how they maintain ‘control’ over their Servants. While Republic frames exercise control via the **serial number and their ability to bond** with a Master, Church frames have access to **Command Spells**, which are given to a Master upon summoning their Servant.

Much like in the years before the flood, Command Spells are like the leash of a dog, able to reinforce and restrain a Servant, such as preventing them from performing certain actions, or forcing them to commit actions they otherwise wouldn’t. They can also be used to temporarily boost a Servant’s parameters, such as by ordering them to defeat a specific foe. However, these buffs are temporary, and rarely last longer than a single fight.

The Command Spells represent absolute obedience. When an order is given through them, a Servant must obey it. At most, they can resist them through Personal Skills, Noble Phantasms, or through an abstract conceptual advantage. This has, naturally, affected how people view Servants within Church cities. With Command Spells, a Master can control even the most unruly Servant, capable of ordering them around without fear. Because of this safeguard, there are a much greater quantity of Masters in Church cities when compared to Republic cities.

However, though they possess Command Spells, the Church frames **lack the abilities of bonding and the consumption of mana batteries to quickly and effortlessly replenish their mana**, which are found in Republic frames. Because of this, Church Servants possess a weaker mana output and a lesser overall mana supply to draw upon, and the lack of a bond means a Master **cannot communicate telepathically with their Servant.** 



# Comparison between Frame Types

## Republic Frames

**Control Type:** Bonding <br>
**Distribution:** Republic owned venues <br>
**Status:** Operational and In-Stock <br>
**Description:** Republic Frames are outfitted with Republic processors that contain 10% of the Holy Grail’s data. This data grants the Servant frames several key features:

1. A **kill switch** that allows Republic’s network or a bonded Master to disable the Mystic Code, effectively killing the summoned Servant.
2. The ability to **bond** with the summoned Servant, which allows the Master to fuel the Servant with the Master’s own mana instead of relying on mana batteries.\
   *In addition, bonding unlocks a slew of other functions in the Servant frame, such as **telepathy**, **mana sharing**, and **strengthening**.*

Despite Republic’s best attempts at foregoing Bonding and generating Command Spells in their frames, they lack the data to do so. Attempts to reverse engineer the Church’s frames have gone poorly due to the strong encryption the Church inserted in their chips.

{{< hint "danger" >}}
**Trust**

**Trust** is the central theme of Republic frames, as they perform best when the Master and Servant are highly compatible. This leads to **bonding**, a process that vastly empowers the Servant frame via **telepathy**, **mana sharing**, and **strengthening**.
{{< /hint >}}


## Church Frames

**Control Type:** Command Spells <br>
**Distribution:** Church owned factories <br>
**Status:** Operational and In-Stock <br>
**Description:** The Church’s frames are outfitted with Church processors that contain data gathered by the numerous Holy Grail Wars that have occurred after the great flood. This data grants the Servant frames several key features:

1. 3 Command Spells that allow the Master to force their Servant to comply with their orders.\
   *They are tied to each Servant summoned. After all 3 Command Spells have been expended, the Servant can no longer receive mana from their Master. They will die when their mana is depleted.*
2. A loss of the Bonding and Kill Switch functions, as well as the ability to ingest Mana Batteries.

Despite the Neo Holy Empire’s attempts at implementing both Bonding and Command Spells into their frames, they are unable to reverse engineer Republic’s processors due to the defensive Geas included in every Republic processor, which causes them to self-destruct if anyone attempts to tamper with them.

{{< hint "danger" >}}
**Contract**

There is **no trust** to speak of with Church frames. Telepathy is unnecessary, and strengthening\*\* outside of using command spells is unreliable. The contract between a Master and Servant is as strong as the Command Spells binding them together. Lose them all, and the Servant dies the moment they run out of mana.

## Differences between Republic and Church Frames

|   FUNCTION    |    REPUBLIC FRAME (PRE-BONDING)     |    REPUBLIC FRAME (POST-BONDING)   |       CHURCH FRAME    |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Replenishing Mana**    | Mana batteries<br>Mana transfer sessions    | Mana sharing with M/S<br>Mana transfer sessions    | Mana sharing with M/S<br>Mana transfer sessions       |
| **Kill Switch**      | Controlled by Republic’s network   | Controlled by the Master (reclaimed by Republic if bond is severed)    | -       |
| **Command Spells**     | -       | -    | 3 spells tied to the summoned Servant. Same functionality as canon.      |
| **Strengthening**     | -      | Yes          | -          |
| **Telepathy**           | -            | Yes           | -          |
| **Contracting with a different Master** | Yes. <br><br>Since there is technically no binding ‘contract’ involved, a Servant is free to go with any Master they wish to. | Yes.<br><br>However, there are consequences attached to breaking the bond with the previous Master. | Yes/No. <br><br> The CS provided by the limited processor chip is a one-time feature tied to that specific Servant frame. <br><br>Contracting with a different Master is possible only if that Servant frame’s CS hasn’t been depleted. |

### Strengthening**

This is not meant to be a direct stat upgrade, **unless** you planned for Servant growth ahead of time (during Signups **before** each new RP season & approved by the mods). Please do not use this feature to justify boosting your Servant stats to beyond what is reasonable or allowed on our server. 

On the other hand, you are more than welcome to give your Servant a weakness, or a defective trait that only goes away after bonding with a Master. 

Just like many other settings of our RP, this is up to the writer’s interpretation and dependent on the Servant in question.
