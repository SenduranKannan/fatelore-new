# Summoning

Once a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame’s core is activated, it will instinctively attempt to summon a Heroic Spirit. A successful summon results in the core morphing the cybernetic body of the Mystic Code into a facsimile of the Heroic Spirit that was summoned.

At this point, the Mystic Code is considered more Servant than golem and it becomes impossible to treat it as a conventional machine. The summoning is permanent and the processor goes inactive, making it impossible to summon a Heroic Spirit twice while using the same Mystic Code.

A Servant summoned via this method will retain all of its memories from the Throne of Heroes, along with the memories it obtained from the processor (what happened to humanity post cataclysm). A Servant will also realize the nature of its mechanical body, but most likely won’t do anything about it since it is no different than having a body purely made of Ether (in FSN) or Data (in Fate/Extra).

# Bonding

It is possible for anyone (including commoners) to forge a connection with a Servant's processor core, so long as the following conditions have been met:

1. The potential Master has installed artificial magic circuits on their body, which are used to sync up to the processor core to establish an initial connection.
2. The Servant in question isn’t bonded to anyone else at the moment.

The bond grants the master unrestricted access to the processor core’s serial and by extension, the kill switch that can permanently shut down the Servant unit. This protocol bypasses any defensive mechanism the Servant may set up to prevent their shutdown, and overrides any command issued by the head company monitoring the Servant via their central network.

The act of bonding itself varies, depending on the traits of the Servant. Some Servants demand specific types of actions to form a connection, which is usually tied to their myth or their feats. As such, there is no universal way to perform a bond and it is a case-by-case basis. Because of this, some Masters forego bonding altogether, in case they do not fit the Servant’s criteria.

The bonding process is left vague on purpose. It's entirely up to the writer's interpretation and dependent on the Servant in question. Some Servants can bond via a simple formal agreement, such as a contract or a verbal vow, while others require more complicated methods such as a blood pact or a sacrifice.

# Severing the Bond

There are multiple ways to sever an established bond:

1. Deactivating the Servant via its kill switch (initiated by the Master).
2. Destroying the Master’s artificial mana circuits (initiated by anyone).
3. Killing the Servant and/or master (initiated by anyone).

After severing the bond, a Servant is able to bond with a new Master provided that they still live. A Master is able to bond with a new Servant **provided that their artificial mana circuits have not been damaged**.

## Risks of Severing the Bond

Severing the bond places great strain on a Master's artificial magic circuits, which they used to forge the bond. The damage caused is dependent on the location of said artificial circuit.

In addition, severing a bond will plague the current Master with memories of the Servant's previous Masters in the form of severe hallucinations, a condition labeled as Erosion by current day researchers. Prevention of this backflow of memory is impossible. Prediction of when the hallucinations will hit is impossible. Prolonged exposure to these hallucinations may have negative consequences on a Master's day-to-day life. Suppressants in the form of pills can alleviate the symptoms somewhat, but they will never truly go away.

Therefore, Magi and Commoners are generally ill-advised to contract with a Servant via bonding unless they have adequately steeled themselves for the consequences. Likewise, if you see a stray Servant in a cardboard box on the side of the street begging for a new owner and/or mana batteries, please call the Servant Shelter Hotline at xxx-xxxx to arrange a retrieval service instead.
