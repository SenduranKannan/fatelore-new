# Overview

![](../media/craft-essence-leylines.png)
In this universe, True Magic is considered a dead art, while Magecraft and the Throne of Heroes have been greatly weakened due to them becoming public knowledge. Even the Counterforce has ceased its activity altogether in this world.

Because of this, Magecraft has been modernized and supported by technological advancements such as Artificial Magic Circuits and Mystic Codes.

# Mana & Magic Circuits

Humans in the New World are unable to harvest atmospheric mana through their own magic circuits. Instead, artificial magic circuits are installed as an extra organ in order to bypass this restriction, filtering and converting atmospheric mana into something anyone can use.

*Placements* of artificial circuits matter a great deal when it comes to their strength and efficiency. Installing them in low risk locations (limbs, shoulder etc.) will result in reduced effectiveness, while high risk locations (spine, heart, eyes etc.) will raise their compatibility past a user’s natural parameters.

*Overloading* artificial circuits can result in harm to the user's internal organs, the destruction of their natural circuits and in more extreme cases, death. Aside from stress accumulated from using magecraft, severing the bond between a Servant and their Master can also place the Master's artificial circuits under great stress, which usually results in the destruction of those circuits.

Under our setting, artificial circuits serve two main purposes:

1. Give everyone (yes, even commoners) access to atmospheric mana and hence, allow for more diverse backgrounds when it comes to creating a magus.
2. Allow one to bond with a Servant, which enables mana sharing (See Summoning & Bonding).

# Mana Batteries

Concentrated storage of mana filtered from the atmosphere through new and improved scientific methods. They resemble tiny capsules similar to multi-vitamins and are commonly drunk by **Republic S.E.R.V.A.N.T.s**. They are sold in a variety of stores, ranging from convenience stores to supermarkets. Servants aren’t allowed to purchase them legally, unless accompanied by a master. This does not stop certain Servants from trying to obtain them illegally or without consent, of course.

*Without bonding or mana transfer,* this is the only way for a Republic Servant to replenish their mana. *After bonding or establishing mana transfer,* a **Republic Servant** can no longer process mana batteries.

**Church Servants** cannot ingest Mana Batteries.

A Master may ingest mana batteries to quickly replenish their mana as well. However, the raw mana from these batteries are akin to poison at such large quantities. It is an adverse side effect that cannot be downplayed IRP. Consult a mod if you wish to do so.

{{< hint "info" >}}
It takes time for a Servant to digest mana batteries. You cannot use mana batteries to insta-replenish a Servant's mana in a fight. You can only do so when out of the fight or with the consent of other participants.

# New World Mages

Artificial Magic Circuits granted everyone the privilege of becoming a magus. However, access to mana and competency are different matters. Most people with no prior training in magecraft can only use their artificial circuits to perform menial tasks at best.

However, while artificial circuits do not automatically make a great mage out of everyone, they can still turn them into living mana batteries and allow them to interact with an array of mana-powered contraptions:

Due to the prevalence of magecraft, there is no discrimination between those born with natural circuits and those who solely rely on artificial circuits. However, mages with *both* high ranking natural and artificial circuits are still rare.
