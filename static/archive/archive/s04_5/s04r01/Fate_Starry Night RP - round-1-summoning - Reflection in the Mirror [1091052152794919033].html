It was not unexpected, nor was it random, yet there was something about a place under the protection of God needing to renovate itself for guests.

It has been three years since the Command Spell appeared on Illyn’s hand. A tribal marking that branded him for a destiny greater than most. Three years ago, when he had resolved to return to normal society and turn his backs on experimentation and wanton cruelty. 

Such a task was hard to commit to, harder to resist.

Illyn stared up at the Benerice Church as he parked his car down the street. He was dressed as if showing up for Sunday mass with a crisp white shirt and clip on tie. He was professional, but not to the point of arrogance. Respectful, yet not groveling under the Lord’s watchful gaze. Older men and women elected to adorn themselves in jewelery with biblical imagery modeled onto them, as if it would make a difference in the end. God did what God willed. 

If God existed, he did not micromanage his creations like a fussy parent. Instead, he let them do what they wished. If a car sped through an intersection and killed an innocent woman, why did it matter? The only people who would mourn were the family…

…and the husband.

The expression on Illyn’s face was almost blank, yet there was a distinct expression of <em>rage</em> and disdain.

With impure thoughts in his heart, Illyn pushed the doors to God’s holy place open.

The scent of candles hung in the air, adding to the peaceful ambiance. There was no one inside, but the place had evidently been inhabited. Recently too, as the wax on the candles were still warm.

Illyn did not have to wait long. The sound of rustling leaves and twigs coming from the backyard announced the presence of at least one more person on premise. A few minutes later, Sister Rosula walked in through the back of the church, her clothes slightly dusty and a bag of pruned leaves in her hands. 

She paused upon seeing Illyn, the sight of the visitor clearly startling her. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, she decided to greet him. &#39;Can I...help you?

He crossed his legs once, then uncrossed them, then recrossed them again, as if deciding on the most comfortable position. His shoes gleamed and he intersected his fingers. The actions were stiff and odd. 

“Or perhaps you can’t. I’ve never seen this building so vacant. It’s a shame, no respect for the Lord from these younger folks. So disrespectful.” If the phrase was meant as an insult, it was tonally poor. This man lacked the charisma to tell a joke, and the expression and tone to imply it was an insult. Illyn said, he looked over Rosula with an amused expression. “Tell me, are you from the Church, or <em>The</em> Church?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Did you see the...&#39;

She remembered what Father Andreas had told her, after he’d set up some <em>’boundaries’</em> around the church. The renovation sign was supposed to ward off irrelevant people from coming in. She didn’t take his words seriously when he said it, as a pair of tourists immediately came stumbling in asking if they could use the bathroom. Was she supposed to believe him?

‘Are you looking for anyone in particular?’ She decided to give the visitor the benefit of the doubt. ‘If you are looking for anyone in particular, you may leave a name, and I’ll see what I can do.’</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fate.* Illyn’s hands fiddled with a small device that looked like one of those small music players that the kids were using these days. As always, IBM gave off a vibe that went against this holy place.

This Sister’s demeanor was interesting. Was she playing coy? Was this simple standard for the Holy Church when overseeing Holy Grail Wars? Illyn had no firsthand experience with the Church, so this visit had been experimental. More to test the waters than to get his hands dirty.

“I was hoping to meet with your Overseer.” Illyn dropped the word nonchalantly. “Yet from what I’ve heard, no such person is here right now. If you want my advice, enhance your security. My little stars twinkled in the night to me about your arrival, see. Welcome to Benerice.”

Illyn dropped information with little care in the world. If this woman was not affiliated with the Holy Church, she would have to go. It was unfortunate, as killing women was a waste. They reminded him of <strong>her</strong>, yet secrecy had to be kept.

“I’m simply reviewing my options and rights as a Master, if you could help me with that. Erm, Sister…?” Illyn trailed off.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I didn&#39;t know how to tell you apart from our regular attendees, you even dressed the part.&#39;

I was hoping for Caster or Berserker, if they are not taken. I’m actually here to clarify a few things on my end.”

The Mage’s Association. As soon as they got wind that Illyn was in Benerice and not protected by Atlas, he would instantly be chased down by Enforcers. Fighting a war on two fronts was never worth it. He thought about how to phrase the question for a few moments, before continuing.

“I’m requesting immunity from the Mage’s Association for the duration of the contest.” Illyn said simply. “They’re not my, ah… hm…” The sentence trailed off. “They’re not my biggest fans. I’d rather not risk participation in the Holy Grail War if my position is haphazard. The Grail would remain unfilled, and a Master would be missing. It is not convenient for me, or for you, see.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Could he be involved in illegal acts? 

Her smile faltered as her mind wandered. She wasn&#39;t good at wearing a mask, and it showed: doubt had crept onto her face even as she tried to remain professional. 

&#39;The Church only offers shelter for Masters who have been disqualified from the War,&#39; she repeated the rules she had taken care to memorize. &#39;We must remain impartial to all participants, unless extenuating circumstances appear. Usually, it involves causing harm to civilians or a risk at revealing mystery to the general populace.

This was not an unexpected outcome, yet Illyn had hoped that the Church’s distaste for the Clock Tower would extend far enough to kick the Mage’s Association in the shins slightly. The notion of Illyn escaping from under their noses was a delightful premise.

Rosula was right, nonetheless. A Servant could shred any magus the Clock Tower sent to Benerice. Assuming, of course, that no magus that visited summoned a Servant of their own. It was an unlikely occurrence, yet unlikely meant that there was a chance. Random. Arbitrary. 

Illyn hated that.

“So they are. I might take you off on that offer, Sister. I do not intend to participate in this war for very long, anyway. I will summon a Servant. If the Servant does not fulfill my requirements, I will <strong>order it to commit suicide.</strong>” Illyn said casually, as if discussing what he was going to make for dinner. The notion of a Master being chosen by the Grail, yet tossing it aside like dross was something that was entirely unexpected.

“Do you think Servants can create a miracle? That they can bring loved ones back to us?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She felt a slight chill as Illyn casually brought up the topic of ridding subpar Servants. Masters were capable of doing that? She may have missed out on a detail or two regarding the potency of the Command Seals, then. But to talk about Servants as if they were commodities...

<em>What was Illyn&#39;s reason for joining the Holy Grail War, if not to win the Holy Grail and be granted a wish?</em> 

But the man seemed to have read her mind, as his question caught her off guard. It was the type of question that <em>she</em> would have like to ask <em>him</em>, because—

&#39;You cannot create miracles if you do not survive until the very end,&#39; she said gravely, her face shaken. &#39;Do you intend to bring someone back? From the dead? Is that your wish for the Holy Grail?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I would’ve had a <strong>child</strong> by this point as well.” Illyn sighed, glancing at Rosula with bemusement.  “It’s a stupid wish, many would assume. People would rather grasp for the Swirl of the Root instead. Those people have never truly lived, and therefore, have nothing that they actively want.”

It was an ominous statement. Magi lived to chase for the Root. Illyn casually tossing it aside for something else, and chastising those who chased after it was something that would have gotten him laughed out of the Mage’s Association. Rosula was a sister of the Church with secondary knowledge of the Clock Tower, yet this seemed off.

“The Holy Grail is simply a powerful magical device.” Illyn explained to her in response to her final question. “Yet it is not even the most powerful device in existence. Atlas has weapons capable of breaking the world apart. The only difference between this Grail and the artifacts I’m used to is that this one exists outside Atlas. My wish for the Grail is something larger and even more foolish, see.”

He leaned in close to Rosula. “Don’t you wish you could stop something awful from happening to you? A loved one? Don’t you wish that things would go <strong>back to normal, with no changes?</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So this was it, then. Death. Bereavement. Loss of a loved one. Families torn apart. Even magecraft couldn&#39;t undo death. Neither could this place called Atlas, by the sound of it. At the end of the day, the Holy Grail really was the golden ticket, as she had been led to believe...

But there was only one problem.

<em>&#39;Just two wishes. One for the Master, and one for the Servant.&#39;</em>

Rosula felt torn. This man called Illyn had lost someone dear to him too. His wish was just as valid and deserving of being fulfilled. But at the same time, she couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of dread at the thought of Illyn&#39;s wish coming true. If the Grail were to grant his wish, then it would mean that her own would go unfulfilled. 

Then, what of <em>their</em> promise to her? Was there a way out of this dilemma?

She looked up, and noticed Illyn staring at her. She realized that she had gone silent, neither acknowledging nor returning his question. 

&#39;I...&#39; Rosula tried to push those negative thoughts aside. What was she even doing, getting lost in her own thoughts when she should have been supporting a Holy Grail War participant! 

&#39;It is not my place to speak.&#39; She shook her head, even as her doubts continued to gnaw at her. &#39;I am only an assistant to the Overseers of this Holy Grail War. The only right I have is to wish for your safe return, and a victorious outcome in the battles ahead. If anyone has the power to change their fate, it can only be you.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only <strong>you</strong> have the right to change your own fate.” Illyn said, leaning in closer. His eyes were flat, yet they seemed to glow with light. A light that Rosula would recognize all too well: <em>drive</em>. Whatever this Master was committing to, he would stop at nothing to accomplish it. 

If anything, he seemed to understand the thoughts going through Rosula’s head. As if at some point, he had struggled with a similar dilemma, and had resolved himself to follow the conclusion he had reached until the end.

“The Grail is a cruel thing, Sister. It crushes the wishes of every person who joins the Holy Grail War, and only allows one to be realized. Is that fair under the principles of Magecraft? Equivalent exchange, yet so many hopes go unrealized to fulfill one singular wish?”

The struggle of thoughts and ideals waging in Rosula’s heart was similar to a war that had once occured within Illyn’s own. At some point, his current mindset had won, and he resolved to fulfill it. Yet he could not recall what had brought him to this point. It all returned back to the device currently in his pocket.

“Your wish, my wish, and every other Master’s wish is of the exact same value. Therefore, it <strong>is</strong> in your place to speak. I can see it in your expression. Boop.” Illyn poked Rosula’s forehead, before leaning back and chuckling. “You have yet to figure out what form your future will take. When you come to the conclusion on what <strong>you</strong> want, you will know yourself better than you ever have before. Take it from me. I’ve killed my own dreams dozens of times.” 

Illyn stood up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite her age, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Illyn was treating her like a child. The way he spoke was eerily reminiscent of the way Ruler used to talk to her. But as much as it disconcerted her, Rosula couldn&#39;t help being drawn in by the familiarity of his tone. 

Despite everything, she couldn&#39;t deny that she too, had a wish.

&#39;...Are all Masters like you?&#39; As Illyn rose from his seat, Rosula hesitate for a moment before finally blurting out her question. But as soon as the words left her mouth, another thought came to mind. 

&#39;There are so many wishes, but only one Holy Grail. It&#39;s unfair,&#39; she focused her gaze on the floor. The injustice of the situation troubled her greatly, knowing that everyone had their own pain and desires, yet only one could be granted. But for Rosula, her own pain cut deeper, as it was more personal, and made her more invested. While justice for all was a noble ideal, to Rosula, it was justice for <em>her</em> that truly mattered.

Illyn&#39;s words strengthened her belief, and the realization that came with it only deepened her despair.

If only there was a way—</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Rosula sat lost in thought, she suddenly heard the creaking of a wheelchair on the polished floor. Illyn was alerted to the sound as well, and as he did, a shadow stretched into the room, cast onto the floor by a figure in wheelchair blocking the light from the window. 

It was only then that Illyn realized that the shadow on the floor had been there all along, only that his mind hadn&#39;t registered its shape as anything out of the ordinary. The wheelchair didn&#39;t just come into the room; it had been there the entire time, the stranger in it observing their conversation, unnoticed until now.

Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was a kid, clad in a plain white robe and wearing a space helmet that seemed way to big for their head. 

<em>If</em> there was even a head underneath, that is. Because Illyn had a feeling that he and Rosula were the only humans in the room.

&#39;Tell me, Mr. Mariston, have you ever had a dream?&#39; The child tilted their head to one side and spoke in a curious tone.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps that’s why we look towards God in times like these.” Illyn turned towards the church’s biblical depictions…

…only to come face to face with a shadow.

In that shadow was a reflection. Illyn looked at himself in the reflection of a helmet, distorted and blackened. There was something behind that mask, yet Illyn could not discern what that could be. It was simply there. Even with the mask, it was clear that it was watching Illyn and Rosula.

Illyn blinked in surprise. “The Church has been hiring awfully young, color me surprised. Maybe the Holy Church and magi are far more similar than I knew.”

Thoughts rushed through the Master’s head at impeccable speeds. This child should not have appeared, yet he was sure that it had always been there, now that it had proclaimed its appearance. That made little logical sense, however. There was nothing hinting that it had been there. Magecraft aimed to distract? It was possible.

Nonetheless, something about this boy was off. Yet Illyn felt like he had to approach the boy. To comfort him. That was to say, <strong>the boy reminded Illyn of himself</strong>.

“Every human dreams.” Illyn turned to face the boy. “It is a fundamental requirement for our existence as intelligent life. Animals dream for food, for open fields, for water. Humans dream for things lost to time and ideals they cannot comprehend. It’s why magi chase after a Swirl that they don’t properly understand. It’s why so many go astray.” Illyn felt conviction in this answer, and yet something about the question unnerved him. Was it double-layered?

“I must go. Thank you for your time, Sister.” Illyn inclined his head to Rosula and to the odd child.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, who could possibly refuse a request from a disabled child?

Or, maybe everyone was at risk of overthinking. The child drew their legs up to their chin and spoke softly. &#39;Another time then, when the stars align,&#39; they gestured with their fingers as if tracing constellations in the sky.

&#39;I can&#39;t wait to meet the Servant you will summon as well. Be sure to stop by and introduce us once they arrive?&#39; They gave Illyn a little wave as he turned to leave.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em> Illyn’s shoes clicked on cobblestone pavement as he made his way to where his car was parked. In the distance, he saw two figures returning to the Benerice Church. He looked away. Likely Church staff. Less likely, Masters. Better to not risk losing his secrecy until his Heroic Spirit was summoned.

Something was gnawing at him. That child. That sister. Sister Rosula was an interesting character, just starting down the path he had chosen a decade ago. If his own path was anything to go by, it would change her in ways she could not expect, just as his had. In the end, it was likely to end in her own annihilation. Just as it had—and would—end in his own.

Something was <em>off</em> about that child. Why was he wearing a helmet? Despite asking all these questions, Illyn had one answer:

Whatever was behind that helmet, it <strong>saw</strong>, and it <strong>knew</strong>.

Why else did it ask him about his dream?

<em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em> Illyn reached his car.

He opened the door.

He sat in the seat. He turned the ignition on. He pulled out his phone. He scrolled down for a moment to a certain contact. It began to ring.

<strong>Ring.</strong>

<strong>Ring.</strong>

<strong>Ring.</strong>

<strong>Click.</strong>

“<em>Hey. You’ve reached [     ] Mariston. I’m sorry, I’m unable to answer the phone right now. I’ll call you back as soon as I can, love you!</em>”
