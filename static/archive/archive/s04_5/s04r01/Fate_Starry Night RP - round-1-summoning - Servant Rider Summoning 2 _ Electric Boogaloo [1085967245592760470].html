France, Paris, 20 meters under the surface

The air was chilling, just as much as the place. A skilled necromancer like her mentor would feel the surge of dead spirits storming through the cold corridors just by standing there. But Layla wasn&#39;t there to experience it, she was on the other side of the Atlantic and didn&#39;t seem like she could finish her business there in less than a few months, leaving her the responsability of handling this War. Not that Blanche was worried, she had been training for years to fight magi and this was nothing more than another job where she had to make sure nothing got too far out of hand. But this job was still special. A wishgranter as a prize, or so the intel said. What was more unique, however, is that that &quot;war&quot; was fought by warriors of the past in their Master&#39;s stead, a battle of familiars in a way, something unusual of magi hunters like her. But from the intel she could gather, those &quot;Servants&quot; were miles beyond magi, it was simply unthinkable to fight one with anything alse than another Servant. 
And so here she was, summoning one in the midst of countless bones, in the hallway of the dead that creeps under the city of the lights. She was unsure of why the Grail had chosen her, but she intended to make use of that selection fully and thoroughly. As she finished chalking down the magic circle, she started chanting the incantation, lone voice in the dark where no one goes.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

From the Seventh Heaven, attended to by three great words of power, come forth from the ring of restraint, Protector of the Balance.

Her calm and crystal-clear voice echoed through the empty tunnels, as her magical energy was filling up the circle, in the middle of which a golden wheel was shining. With each verse, the glow brightened, until it was like a bonfire in the middle of the bones. And yet she stood still, continuing her incantation. As the final word flowed through her lips, the light reached its maximum intensity, barring all sight of what was in the circle for a brief moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the grounds of the dead, which had stood for hundreds of years, the song echoing in the dark sung of a disturbance. And in the glowing, cold blaze that shone in the center of the firestorm, that disturbance took shape and form. Slowly, the light faded away, and then she saw <em>him</em>.

A warrior stood before the Necromancer, a tall, strong man in dark and gold. His armor looked like a dark bronze, yet somehow gave the impression of being harder than the mightiest steel. His clothes, rich and decorated royal silks, fell strangely over it, weaving forgotten patterns in gold and jewelry. His sharp, inquisitive eyes stared ahead at the deceptively young-looking Magus, her white hair and grey clothes contrasting his dark appearance.

Eyes that seemed to be asking something.

“So you are my Master.”

A statement, not a question. That was not what he wanted to know, it seemed. Rather, it was something obvious to guess.

There was something about it all - the haunting whispers of the dead, the chariot wheel resting on the ground, and the overflowing mana coming from the Magus’ body. 

—Deja vu.

The warrior frowned. His mouth mumbled something in a long-dead language, low as to barely be heard. Then, his face grew serene. It seemed he finally had figured out what he had to ask. But first—

“I am Shalya, King of the Madras, great among warriors. I greet you, Master, and thank you for hosting me in this world.”

He saluted her with his hand and smiled. Yet, he did not bow even an inch.

“But you’re no ordinary mortal Magus, are you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Blanche has to agree, her intel didn&#39;t lie about ancient warriors, at least as far as the man&#39;s stature, gear and aura go. And he declares himself as Shalya, matchikg what she knew about the users of the chariot of which the wheel served as catalyst. Blanche answered his inquisitive stare with her own, two crimson eyes like rubies looking right at him. 

And then, she broke the tension of that stare as it came, a subtile rictus on her face. 

&quot;Indeed. Your eyes are sharp, Shalya. I am Blanche Khaldun, a mage-hunter who fights to protect humans from the threats of the mystical world we belong to. I hope you won&#39;t mind serving one with such a goal in that War ? With a conflict of that scale, the risk that another Master or Servant wreaks havoc and endangers lives is high, so I&#39;ll need your help to prevent that from happening. Will you fight by my side in that aim ?&quot; 

She then walked closer to him, waiting for the warrior&#39;s answer before doing anything else.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Shalya knew that Karna, who he&#39;d later come to learn had been the child of the very sun, was more well-known among the peoples of the Kali Yuga. And yet the magus seemed very satisfied with his presence. Good - that would make things easier.

But there was more. He hadn&#39;t expected his Master to match his gaze so fiercely and dispassionately, as she explained her position in the War. A mage-hunter… the concept was foreign to Shalya, who had lived in an age where the sages, spirits, and Devas who were the greatest in the magical arts tended to be the wisest. Yet, it was also something he could understand - in such a rotten age, where Dharma stood on a single leg, even those of wicked hearts could freely manipulate the unseen forces. He shuddered.

And yet, he felt like he could trust those fire-like eyes that reminded him of his sister—

&quot;There is no greater Dharma for a Kshatriya than to fight a war for the sake of the innocent. I will gladly stand by your side, Master.”

There was still a nagging question, though. A suspicion, perhaps, was born of the trap Duryodhana had set for him long ago.

&quot;I must ask, though... is there nothing you mean to wish for, should we attain the Holy Grail?&quot;

Shalya was proud and mighty. And most of all, he was able to recognize competence. With a Master skilled enough to slay the deviant mages of the Kali Yuga, and who shared the same defiant wisdom his sister had once possessed, he rated his chances quite highly. Thus, there was no point in delaying that question.

Would such directness be a strength or a weakness? The War had not yet begun, and not a single soul could tell.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ancient heroes could be prideful, and those who answered  the call of the Grail were those who had unfinished business on Earth, those who have their own wishes. Unlike a created being like most homonculi or a regular familiar, Servants had agendas of their own, and mages betrayed or killed by their own Servant who had a different goal were not undeard of. 

And yet Shalya here was ready to fight with her to defend the civilians, reminding her of the moral law upheld by warriors of his time and place. What was the core of her actions since she could think for herself was also a principle that he followed. Therefore, Blanche was relieved. 

His question, however, was a different matter.

&quot;As of now, not that I know of. I don&#39;t know why the Grail chose me as a Master either, when I have no real wish to give to it. What about you ? If you answered my summons to fight for the Grail, you must also have a wish of your own, right ?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Such were the words of the wise. 

Perhaps it was the frigid and somber atmosphere of the catacombs, or else [trust] was something that Shalya had not yet been able to regain, but the white-haired Master’s words sounded suspiciously like a deflection. He could not even fault her for it. Incisively, Blanche asked a question immediately after. A question that Shalya had no intention of immediately replying to.

Still, he would not underestimate her capabilities, nor would it even cross his mind to forsake the opportunity to fight and protect the innocent. But even one who followed the path of Dharma could occasionally lie. The tall knight stopped for a moment to think, and their gazes, which remained locked in a way that would terrify most mortals, showed remarkably little stress, and profound interest.

His answer was tactful by the standards of his time. For a modern woman who lived in a world steeped in deception, however—

“All those who the Grail calls have a wish that is dear to them. Perhaps you do not know yours, but I am certain you will discover it in the course of this war.”

He paused.

“I shall endeavor to assist you in figuring it out. And when you do - I shall tell you my wish.”

It was a trifle, really. Something that would hardly change the world at all, though it could not be achieved except with the aid of the Grail. And yet—

It was revealing enough that Shalya would not tell it to one who had not earned his complete [trust].</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One could expect her to have a wish that would allow humanity to grow without the threats of the magical world, a wish in line with her life&#39;s work, but there wasn&#39;t any method she could think nor wish of that wouldn&#39;t be a pending sword of Damocles over all magi, and she didn&#39;t think of herself highly enough to justify being the one to choose for everyone. But Shalya&#39;s words were true.

&quot;My wish ... yes, it is possible that I find it during this war. Securing the Grail is a sufficient goal for me, we just need to make it happen. That being said, the War doesn’t seem to have started yet, and we aren&#39;t in Berenice yet, so that will have to wait a little. With that in mind, why don&#39;t we learn about each other ? It would be a liability for both of us to not know about each other&#39;s strenghts and weaknesses.&quot; 

While saying that, Blanche picked up the few things she had brought for the ritual, erasing the traces and retrieving the wheel. She then pointed at the corridor and said :

&quot;But first, we should probably get out of here, unless you want to stay in the catacombs rather than in the open air.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 21, 2023 3:48 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As her face gave no sign of being distraught at his lack of [trust], Shalya grew warmer. It was not simply a sign of friendship - the warrior was honing his mind with calm to see through truth and lie, friend and foe. 

He judged her words, and he found them wise. Most did not know themselves - could Shalya even claim he did? So there was nothing wrong with a Magus who was unaware of their wish - but the precise nature of that wish would continue to nag at him. Decided to struggle for the Grail in any case, he remained watchful as Blanche erased the traces of the summoning circle and only then replied.

&quot;It is best that we make ready before the battle is joined, yes.&quot;

The mage and the warrior climbed up the stairs, and slowly the whispers of the dead grew weaker. Blanche was a highly cautious magus - as they moved, Shalya could not sense a single telling sign of his summoning there. Perhaps a great sage would have seen through it - but the wisest of men were dead, and even then he was doubtful. Honoring her caution, he vanished into spiritual form, thoughtful. He was just about to answer his Master when a new sight struck him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093306040973537320 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093306040973537320><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 5:47 PM">5:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>---Paris.

The Grail had told the summoned Heroic Spirit precious little about that city, given it was not the site of the war. But even if he had been warned, he could scarcely conceal his surprise. From his knowledge human corruption, he had expected the Kali Yuga to be an age of anarchy and lawlessness. So what was this gloriously shining, sprawling metropolis? Bright lights shone on through the night, and people moved busily around, covered in warm clothes to guard against the chilly breeze, their faces expressing happiness, sadness, apathy, or anger. The streets - some large as a king&#39;s road would have been - were full of trees, their leaves almost all fallen in the approaching winter. He saw marvelous constructions - the modern human temples and palaces - scattered throughout the city, which extended onto the horizon, unending. Truly, that was a land fit for a King.

Shalya wondered. Was that city one like the Tripura, the magical realm of the Asuras, whose deep knowledge was only matched by their evil? Or was it a city of wise men and women, a paradise on Earth like Yudhishtira&#39;s Indraprastha? Perhaps it was neither, but it nevertheless amazed him that such a city could flower in the depths of the Kali Yuga.

&quot;Shall we remain here for some more days, while I recount to you my battles and the lessons I learned from them? I desire to know your world.&quot;

That was what he said, but his words revealed his deep affection. The King of the Madras had always held a passion for the magnificent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A city whose origins go back to the last decades of the Roman Republic, changed thoroughly multiple times during its long history, an evermorphing metropolis that deeply left its mark in European history. Perhaps because of how much attention there could be was it easier to hide in plain sight there than anywhere else, thus the Khalduns owned a pied-&#224;-terre there, an inconspicuous flat in the midst of the City of Lights from where all of France was accessible. Staying in France for a few more days shouldn&#39;t be an issue thanks to that, the War wasn&#39;t gonna start so soon ...

&quot;Yes, I guess that is a good idea. Arriving in Egypt right when the War is about to start would be suspicious, but arriving too early would also risk being identified before it even starts. Let&#39;s stay in Paris for now.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
