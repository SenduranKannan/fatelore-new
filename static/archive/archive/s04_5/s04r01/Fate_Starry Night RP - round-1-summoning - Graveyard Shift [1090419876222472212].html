The flight from LA to Egypt was an arduous one. At least for the standards of travel for the time. Compared to what Christopher would have understood as traveling, this was as easy as it could be. A potentially decades long journey, done within a matter of days? Those things called planes could be considered miracles in their own rights. Those layovers were pleasant bits of respite from the air. Which Marcus took the opportunity to smoke at every chance given. Always offering a cigarette to Lancer, who remained largely silent. Something the necromancer didn&#39;t mind. 

Upon finally arriving in Egypt, Marcus would not be surprised to see that Henrietta didn&#39;t bother with transport to the Ferry. So the coroner drug himself with what little belongings he brought through customs. 

It was about two hours later when the pair had finally reached the Ferry&#39;s dock. 

It was quaint silence on the river. Neither choosing to break the blessed stillness which rested between them. It would have to be broken eventually. &quot;Lancer.&quot; Marcus spoke within his mind looking at the approximate area which he expected the spirit to be residing in spiritual form. Taking the coin out again and transforming it into a flask, and taking a sip from it. He didn&#39;t follow up the initial calling for Lancer&#39;s attention. Instead gazing out towards the waters, a look of sadness grew upon his face. 

&quot;It is beautiful, I suppose.&quot; The coroner spoke to himself, speaking to someone else who might not even be there.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 8:43 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090443063509393440 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090443063509393440><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 8:11 PM">8:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

What might have taken months only took the pair a few days on board the flying vessels known as planes. The cockpit itself might have proved troublesome had Lancer been in a corporeal state, but he abided himself in a spiritual sense by simply counting the seconds it took to reach the dock. It was a pittance compared to what he was prepared for. 

Now, they both stood at the bank of the vast and gleaming river that would guide them to Aswan. And to their warzone, Lancer noted. They had chosen to make their arrival in the early hours of the morning, and so they both were able to take in the calm of darkness that settled over the riverbed in the still moments before the sun could graze its waters. 

&quot;...It is.&quot; 

His cape unfurled about him, fluttering at Marcus&#39; back as Lancer manifested, silently, behind his Master, his gaze on the early flickers of life that came from Aswan&#39;s lights. A beacon for the end of their travels. And a harbinger for the war ahead of them. 

&quot;...This war will not be kind to this city.&quot; He wasn&#39;t exactly speaking to Marcus, as much as he was reflecting on what was to come next. It was a small bastion of life, but one that still held a congregation far more numerous than he was expecting. The thought weighed heavily, but it was one he had to quickly toss aside as he glanced back to the flask in Marcus&#39; hand. How could he even drink at such a time like this...

&quot;I hope you&#39;re prepared for it.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He simply took another sip in response. Taking another step towards the edge of the river. &quot;When has war ever been kind?&quot; Marcus responded finally looking over towards the lupine features of his servant. Absentmindedly that flask outstretched along with his gaze. 

&quot;Of course I am. I just need the resources to adequately handle it.&quot; The flask remained offered towards the Saint. &quot;Casualties will happen. It is a fact.&quot; The Necromancer then turned slightly, his body now facing towards the servant. &quot;Are you prepared for it?&quot; He parroted the question right back.

“That is understood, Lancer. Targeting the common folk is always a faux pas. Something which my life prior would abstain me from doing.” It was hard to tell the truth in that statement as The coroner looked towards the boat slowly approaching. That pervasive ennui which seemed to drift from the man sullied any words he spoke.

I doubt much else can really come from a church visit, Master.&quot;

The boat&#39;s motor was now roaring in the wake of the river&#39;s spume, having cut through the stillness between this tranquil time. 

&quot;I have full trust you&#39;ll serve me well as a Master, Marcus Adler. Although, it&#39;s not hard to win. Keeping it is another matter. When we get to the church, it might be best if you did the talking. You&#39;re probably used to some messed up sights, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why I came as no initial surprise. I doubt a clergyman would feel the same though. I&#39;ll be at your side, though maybe grab a cloak or something while you make your way to the church, I want to stretch my legs too.&quot; 

A cascade of sparks floated away with Lancer&#39;s last words. They drifted past Marcus&#39; cheeks before and faded in the first rays of the rising sun as it bloomed behind the towering heights of the Aswan city in the distance. 

&quot;I could&#39;ve carried us across, you know.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090493889787461684 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090493889787461684><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 11:33 PM">11:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Levying a joke, even if it wasn’t delivered in a comedic manner. The final leg of their journey was nearing its completion. 

While on the boat itself it was another solitary moment upon the vast expanse of the Nile. Leaving him to collect his thoughts. His servant had made it clear plenty of times that he can just abandon the wish he wanted to pursue. Physical Strength was something that Christopher glorified, the only thing close to coming second was Strength of Character it seemed. Things Marcus lacked in recent years. Yet he could always fake it until the cat is out of the bag. Confidence in one’s own skill is always the hallmark of a great surgeon, after all. 

While in his thoughts the Coroner absentmindedly lit another cigarette. A way to pass the peaceful time on the ferry. 

Upon finally crossing the River, Marcus began his walk towards the church. Picking up a cloak, per The Saint’s request. Hopefully it would disguise the monolith of a man he had summoned. “Your cloak. Feel free to try it whenever.” The necromancer spoke through their mental connection.

The pair, or rather simply Marcus, had stepped foot in the bustle that came from the city of Aswan. The throng of people was a veritable sea that was only matched by the constant stream of vehicles floating down the streets, rivaling the powerful surge of the Nile. It hardly provided the comfort or privacy to allow Lancer to don the handmade cloak. As the two approached the church, a respite within a narrow alleyway gave the perfect opportunity to allow Christopher to drape the cloth around his head. It draped across his broad shoulders, with a surprising amount of length, at least enough to come to the middle of his back broad back. It hid the ferocious visage quite well, though didn&#39;t do much for his larger than life stature. Hopefully they wouldn&#39;t be in public enough for it to pose a problem. If he had to spend anymore time in his spiritual form, he was going to go Stark raving mad and just devolve to referring to himself as a cosplayer. He&#39;d heard about that on the trip across the Atlantic Ocean, and what had been an absurd notion was starting to become more liberating. 

&quot;The church has notions about their saints and apostles, but I figure most people wouldn&#39;t be able to recognize their heroes if they met them face to face. I doubt this overseer would even be able to recognize Jesus if he walked through those doors.&quot; 

Christopher limply fluttered the cloak, before doing a small spin to test how well it would cling to him while walking the streets. Eh, it would do. 

&quot;Hopefully this didn&#39;t cost too much, cause you may have to buy a few.&quot; 

He snickered at the joke, but softly, as he was taking in the heights of the church that lingered from the small peer way of the alley. It&#39;s structure rose and blocked out the early morning rays, an orange halo surrounding its base. Lancer started forward, motioning for Marcus to follow as they walked the stone steps. His footfalls were heavy, but plodding.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090721290987515914 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090721290987515914><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 29, 2023 2:37 PM">2:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
His leather boots scrapped lightly as trepidation took hold of Lancer. He&#39;d carried Christ across a river...liberated Christians from persecution...but one thing he&#39;d yet do was step inside a church. The doorway sat lightly ajar, to welcome those that wished to give worship, and it was the heaviest door he&#39;d ever heaved against as Christopher gave push. 

&quot;...remember, you do the talking, I&#39;m not normally talkative. You just give me a lot of crap to complain about.&quot;  Lancer opened the door, and the pair walked in.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090721338043404299 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090721338043404299><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 29, 2023 2:37 PM">2:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That meant no gardening, no matter how much her fingers itched to do so. With the Holy Grail War drawing Masters to the church at irregular hours, she didn&#39;t want to discourage anyone from entering by making it appear abandoned.

To pass the time, which she had suddenly found herself to have an abundance of, Rosula took up a new hobby that was both engaging and required minimal movement - crocheting. She purchased various kits and patterns, even creating some of her own, and would spend hours on end crocheting while seated on one of the pews in the church.

Although Ruler would usually assist her by winding yarn, she appeared to be alone on this particular day. As she sat with all her tools sprawled around her, she suddenly heard the door creak open.

Instinctively, she turned around to greet the visitor, and found herself in the presence of <em>two</em> of them. As she had yet to receive Masters who came with their own company, this could only mean one thing: that one of them was a Servant, with the other being the Master.

It wasn&#39;t hard to figure out which was which.

She found herself craning her neck to look up at the exceptionally tall man, until her neck began to hurt. They were draped in a shroud of some kind, though it barely concealed their towering stature. The dim light of the church made it difficult to discern their features, but she felt both intimidated and pacified at once by their imposing presence.

How odd.

Thus, she made an effort to curb her fears before rising from the bench. Her eyes fell upon the normal-sized man who trailed behind the towering figure, and she felt a small sense of relief. 

&#39;Hello,&#39; she greeted the man with a friendly smile, noticing the lines that etched his tired face. &#39;Is there anything I can help you with?&#39;

In the end, she decided to be a little cautious and opened with a fairly innocuous question, just in case the two weren&#39;t actually Master and Servant and were simply tourists who were here to sightsee.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 2:13 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090896079437971456 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090896079437971456><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 2:11 AM">2:11 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The church was awe inspiring, that is if Marcus held an ounce of the fear of god within his heart. The golden halo of the sun illuminating the pale skin of the coroner, and causing him to have to squint as he looked upon the church. A sight that should typically cause one to feel a sense of overwhelming awe, not the dread of dealing with the meaningless drivel of the church.   

“Welcome to the club, I find myself having much to complain about my own life.” Marcus retorted as they stepped inside of the church. Upon his eyes finally adjusting to the interior he was greeted by the presence of a nun. 

A false smile plastered itself upon his face. “Hopefully we didn’t catch you at a bad time, sister.” The Necromancer positioned himself in front of the looming figure of the Saint in his company. “I believe it is custom in a holy grail war to appear in the local church and introduce one’s self.” He motioned towards the crocheting which the sister had busied herself with. “Not half bad, you could teach my resident a thing or two about suturing.” 

The man then stepped forwards with an outstretched hand. “Marcus Adler, Coroner.

He instinctively backed away, giving Rosula and Marcus the chance to discuss more of the war and the proceedings while he himself took a look around. 

The inside was rustic, but majestic. Somewhere that could feel like a home. Early morning painted the walls in a dim cascade of stained glass light, lighting on the stations of the cross and the life of christ with a splash of color.

He kept close, so far as to make sure Marcus didn&#39;t offend the nun in any way. He had been expecting a clergyman, and could have potentially built up the courage to say something to a priest...but in the presence of a nun? One that already had such a soft countenance, and one that looked as she did...

The light of the narthex remained dim, shielding his face from possibly frightening the nun, but there was enough light that drew Lancer to the paintings on display. 

Saints. 

Lucia. Anastasia. Abraam. Each one displayed proudly by name, either in their works or in their last moments as a martyr. All of them stoic, but with a soft reverence for whoever would look upon them. 

He grazed the face of Gideon, feeling the tanned and roughness of the tapestry from beneath his gloves, careful not to damage the frame. He half listened, lost in the aisle of saints and martyrs that decorated the entrance to welcome the flock of worshipers that might grace these halls. His face not among them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090992087178166465 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090992087178166465><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 8:33 AM">8:33 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Please, make yourself home,&#39; she said, gesturing towards the pews. &#39;I apologize for the roundabout question. We occasionally receive regular visitors, so I just wanted to make sure.&#39;

She took a seat herself and quickly organized her crocheting tools, a small smile played at the corner of her lips and her face brightened by the compliment Marcus had given her. She ran her fingers fondly over the kid-sized mittens that had just begun to take shape, before putting them away with the balls of yarn.

She then straightened herself and regarded Marcus more formally.

&#39;You are correct,&#39; she nodded. &#39;While not every Master reports to the church, we do encourage it. It helps us keep track of the number of participants. It&#39;s especially important for <em>this</em> Holy Grail War, since Father Andreas mentioned that the scale is unprecedented, and we won&#39;t know the exact number of Masters and Servants until the Grail fully manifests.&#39;

She tucked a stray hair back into her bun, her expression more serious than before as she shifted into work mode. The knowledge that had been drilled into her finally had its practical use. She cast her gaze on the Lancer as he perused the tapestries along the walls. His gait fell near silent on the floor despite their size, a testament to their otherworldly nature.

&#39;You are the <em>third</em> Lancer we have received,&#39; she recounted the list of names she had painstakingly logged into the church&#39;s computer, keystroke by keystroke. &#39;Far more than the other classes so far. I wonder if you&#39;ll be the last, Mr...?&#39;

A taboo.

The large man scrambled to clear up his mistake. He placed Abraam back, slanted, before taking in Rosula once more, hurriedly putting his hood back in place to hide his snout. 

His name? She wanted to know his name? He quickly scolded himself for having such inspid queries regarding the reason, before sharing a quick glance with Marcus. Normally he&#39;d be more guarded about his true name...but surely they could trust her? Her eyes gave the impression of someone that wouldn&#39;t let slip their ace in the hole.

Wait. Third Lancer? 

&quot;Wait, wait...hang on, what do you mean third Lancer? You don&#39;t know how many...Master, did you know about this? What the hell are you talking about, lady?&quot;

Pulling his coin from his pocket and with a small flick of his wrist it became a flask. “Can never be too careful in these times, especially with the legends surrounding some of these wars.” Then in the next flick of his wrist it became a lighter. 

The coroner paid a little mind to the mittens that the sister was currently working upon. Either a child resides in this church or she was working on some gift for an orphanage nearby. Then the woman said something that shocked the necromancer. Not only committing a major taboo in the terms of a grail war, but giving a new perspective on what this war would entail. 

“We’re the third… what?” A genuine look of confusion found itself taking over that faked smile. The necromancer then shot that same look of confusion over towards his servant who seemed equally disturbed by the news. “Listen, lancer. I’m equally out of loop on this as you. The hag didn’t tell me anything about the scope of this war.” His wrist flicked once more and now he was holding the flask. Opening the container he took a quick swig. The man’s way to cope with this sudden shock. 

“Is the church even prepared for something like this? What do they even have as backup for if nothing goes right?” The man’s expression darkened, ridding itself from that momentary confusion as he leaned closer towards rosula, elbows placed upon his knees flask loosely hanging from one hand. 

He could only question if this island would even be standing after the war concludes. A potentially large group of magus and servants. All in one place. There might not be a chance for Marcus to stay ‘the bigger person’ which would only risk he and lancer’s contract.

&#39;This is why it&#39;s helpful to us if all the Masters could report to us before the War commences, so that Father Andreas and Mr. Gabriele can prepare the necessary contingency plans...&#39;

Her voice trailed off as the hooded Lancer moved in an unsettling manner. The outline of his form seemed to shift and bulge in places, resembling certain features that was distinctly inhuman. Triangular peaks jutted out of his head, resembling animal ears, and a snout protruded from beneath the hood. The hairs on his head stirred in a bestial manner, and Rosula felt a chill run down her spine as she realized the true nature of this Servant.

No, it was not uncommon for Servants to take on monstrous forms. But to someone who had been blissfully ignorant of the world of mystics until barely two months ago, Lancer&#39;s form was still a jarring sight to behold. Instinctively, Rosula slowed down her breathing, as if she were facing a predatory animal in the wild.

<em>The church is a designated safe zone. Acts of violence are strictly prohibited.</em>

She repeated the doctrine in her mind, willing herself to calm down. <em>Think of the rules. Think of your role. You are protected.</em> She forced herself to concentrate on Marcus&#39; sleight of hand &#39;tricks&#39;, her words tumbling out in a nervous manner. 

&#39;The past Grail Wars,&#39; Rosula reached for more book knowledge, &#39;All Grail Wars have had their fair share of accidents... But in the event that a public enemy reveals themselves, the Overseers will call upon the other Masters to join forces and defeat the common foe. For a reward, of course.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091233704527024160 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091233704527024160><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 31, 2023 12:33 AM">12:33 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just what kind of Battle Royale had he been dragged into? It seemed Marcus was in the dark on the large portion of these matters, but how much of that was true? And how much was an act? 

It also wouldn&#39;t do well for the overseer of their War to simply rattle off rules and regulations robotically, it was only going to serve to antagonize him further. 

&quot;Stop talking for a second. Okay...&quot; 

The hound massaged his temples and took a seat behind Rosula and Marcus, taking up nearly the entire space between the two on his own pew. &quot;Look, lady, I&#39;m sorry. ...if it&#39;ll make it up to you, just call me Chris. I&#39;m not gonna bother asking how many Masters you <em>have</em> met because I&#39;m honestly a little scared of the number. Just...is this church really the overseer for this? If this is all there is, I&#39;m a little worried about what&#39;s going to happen.&quot; 

The concern was evident, and as he sat Rosula could see his cloak finally recede and reveal his true face. The bristled snout of a wolf was finally revealed, with Grey fur clashing strongly with the pale blue eyes that searched the altar tiredly. Scars were etched in and broke up the fur, and gave the Lancer a visage of true ferocity. 

Chris the wolf.

Marcus felt rather comforted by his old biases against the church. This was just meaningless drivel. 3 other master had alone summoned a Lancer.

A voice prodded at his conscience, a gentle yet persistent nudge, but it had not come from his own mind. Lancer turned his head, trying to catch a glimpse of the speaker, but there was no one there.

<em>rustle rustle</em>

Then he felt it. The sensation of something nestled against him. He looked down and saw a child, their face hidden under a bulbous space helmet that seemed too large for their size. 

The child appeared small and thin, no bigger than ten or eleven years of age. They were draped in a plain, white robe that hung loosely over their form, their bare feet swinging back and forth as they perfectly wedged themselves in the small amount of space Lancer had left on the pew.

At first glance, they seemed harmless enough, yet something was distinctly off. Neither Lancer nor Marcus had sensed their presence until now, which was disconcerting. The half-eaten candy bar and multiple wrappers littered on their lap suggested that they had been sitting there for a while, but for how long had they been snacking away, unnoticed? And how long had they known which side of the bench Lancer would take, so as not to be crushed under his weight?

Was this all part of an elaborate scheme, a sleight-of hand that not even Marcus&#39; impressive coin trick could compare?

&#39;Don&#39;t be too hard on the Sister,&#39; the child chided, looking up at Marcus through the dark, reflective visor of their helmet, their face obscured by the helmet&#39;s tint. &#39;In a sense, the Overseers&#39; responsibilities are indeed limited. But, the way you speak of it, it sounds as though you are anticipating something terrible to happen. That goes against your wish, doesn&#39;t it?&#39;

<em>crunch</em>

They fed another candy bar under their helmet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091982296711700520 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091982296711700520><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 2:07 AM">2:07 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The gentle nudging of a space helmet as a figure bobbed at his side. The frail body and the alarming heap of candy bar wrappers that were now covering his boots, smearing chocolate and peanut butter filling against the soles. His eyes trailed from the wrappers back to the boy as the Hound searched for any kind of entrance or disturbance that could have betrayed the child&#39;s presence from before. Had he walked in after and just decided to eavesdrop? Was the sister hiding them? No, her face held surprise, but a subtle hint of knowing. This has happened before. And unluckily for Lancer, it was right when he partially revealed his name...

Not that it mattered. Realization came when Lancer felt chill of the morning rustle the fur between his ears, and he knew he had made a mistake and let his emotions get the better of him. He quickly folded the hood back over himself, doing his best to make up for the fright Rosula must have suffered at the sight of his ferocious visage. &quot;Sorry,&quot; He managed, curtly, before turning his attention back to the boy. 

&quot;...So, Sister. Is he yours?&quot; He asked bluntly, though distantly as well. His eyes trained themselves on the child, and he pointedly scooched the boy away from himself, mostly to save what little he could of the quality of his armor. &quot;He seems very smart for his age. Very...<em>perceptive.</em>&quot; 

<em>He&#39;s a Servant</em> was said through the subtle glance that Lancer threw back to his Master. Though it was growing near time for them to start making preparations, especially with the news Sister Rosula dropped in their lap...this was a little too much to ignore. Was this nun an overseer? Why was there a Servant hanging about? Was she its Master, or was there someone else lying in wait, and this was all a big trap. 

Besides, the boy did speak something interesting. He had picked up on the certainty in Marcus&#39; tone when he discussed the foregone conclusion of casualties. He was curious how his Master would respond.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091989655852953730 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091989655852953730><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 2:37 AM">2:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There wouldn’t be blood spilt here by either Necromancer or Saint. However another presence made itself known. A child.

Marcus turned towards them. Catching Christopher’s knowing glance. This could spell trouble. An assassin class potentially. Just given their ability to remain unnoticed up until this moment. “Rather advanced for a child their age.” The coroner added to his servant’s comments. Pediatrics was never his forte, but from what he did remember this child was not like any other. 

“I am only making an educated guess.” The Necromancer’s gaze turned towards that of the blank reflection of Ruler. Viewing his old form within its gaze. The falsehood of kindness having left the man’s face. “This is a trial by fire, that’s the only option.” With another flick of the wrist the coin was tossed into the air. 

“Forgive my personality coloring my perspective. It’s just an honest assessment. Something that needs to be shared with one so na&#239;ve.” His hand then caught the coin, it becoming a knife in the next moment. The wish to cure the world of an illness. It couldn’t be feasibly achieved without some danger. The fact of this increased scope of the war, it only meant there was an increased amount of danger for both those involved and the innocents of Berenice. “Think of it as a trauma alert. And this church is no where near equipped enough to handle it.” The man then moved his wrist again, letting the coin rest calmly within his palm. 

“It doesn’t contradict my wish.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092042159080865824 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092042159080865824><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 6:05 AM">6:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Against their will, the child was forced to the far end of the pew. Lancer had brushed them aside like a squeegee removing a stain from polished wood, and now they sat all by their lonesome, with nothing but sticky candy wrappers to keep them company.

As Lancer pushed, a curious sensation tingled under his hands. Though he could feel the bony structure, skin, and sinew on the child&#39;s body, there was a certain brittleness that yielded under his grip. Faint cracking sounds filled his ears, like the delicate shattering of porcelain.

Looking at the child&#39;s arms now, exposed as they were as the child continued to eat, deep, spiderweb-like cracks began to form across their skin. Underneath, a dark substance swirled like the night sky. 

It was as if the child was made of something other than flesh and blood, something that couldn&#39;t withstand the force of a simple push. Yet, as they continued to munch on candy, the &#39;wounds&#39; slowly but surely began to knit together, as if the consumption of nutrients had offset the damage.

Lancer&#39;s lingering doubts were put to rest. It was clear that the child was not human.

A Servant, then? But what kind of Servant was frail to a Servant&#39;s touch?

Perhaps they were human after all—</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;He&#39;s like you,&#39; she admitted, unaware of the telepathic conversation Lancer and Marcus had been passing in silence. &#39;A Ruler-class Servant. Here to maintain order of the Holy Grail War.&#39;

They spoke softly, yet there was an unwavering conviction that left no room for debate. The assurance of someone who <em>knew</em>, not merely <em>believed</em>. A faith far removed from that of a Saint, but a faith all the same. 

&#39;I like to think of violence not as an answer, but a process. A means to an end that can be refined and optimized, so that we can achieve the desired outcome with minimal harm. To give up in search of that optimization is not very...scientific, don&#39;t you think?&#39;

Leaning forward, the child grabbed the back of the bench where Marcus had been sitting, their chocolate-stained fingers leaving dark smudges all over the wood.

&#39;But your wish is admirable.&#39; Their helmet bopped back and forth, forcing Marcus to stare at his own reflection. &#39;You seek to alleviate the suffering of many by bearing the pain of a few. Quite the noble pursuit...&#39;

The helmet swiveled in Lancer&#39;s direction.

&quot;...You&#39;re kind of creepy, you know that?&quot; Lancer bit back against the frail child, he himself slightly perturbed at the slow stitching of his otherworldly wounds brought about by Reese&#39;s Cups and Babe Ruth bars. &quot;Me being a Saint or not doesn&#39;t have any bearing on the pain that should manifest. Ruler...Master. Both of you keep talking about pain and suffering as a process, a step towards peace. But who&#39;s suffering we&#39;re speaking of is where I disagree.&quot; 

Lancer rose, his shroud falling back slightly as his eyes turned back to Rosula. Their sharpness was gone, melted moreso as he looked at her expression. He could tell already she&#39;d been in the presence of this child for a while...this Ruler. The way she simply abided them, gave them freedom to speak and hold sway. Herself receded...

&quot;...Sister, wouldn&#39;t you agree? How noble can a wish be if it&#39;s going to sit on the backs of those that had no desire for a wish in the first place. Even an altruistic wish can have ulterior motives. And even a process as simple as violence can escalate if its not watched. Like my Master said,&quot; Lancer turned back to Marcus and Ruler, only now he peered at both with a sharpened glare befitting his appearance. &quot;This is set to be a trial by fire. I will do my part to make sure only those that joined willingly are burned. Anything else is too far, and to see the Grail War consume innocent people is something I won&#39;t abide&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;It&#39;s like you said, Ruler.&quot; The shine of his fangs was gone now, though Lancer lowered himself slightly once more to be at eye level and...visor level with both parties. &quot;I am a Saint. Anything less wouldn&#39;t be in my nature.&quot; 

With the dis-pleasantries out of the way, Lancer pointed towards Ruler before opening his palm, gesturing for the child to place something inside. &quot;You gonna share or what? C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll take processed sugars over his smoking any day. What&#39;ve you got? Oh, and since we seem to be on a <em>first name basis</em>&quot; a small growl accompanied that, Lancer clearly not being a fan of Ruler&#39;s brand of humor, &quot;is there anything I should call you, instead? I figure obviously I&#39;m not going to know who you really are, but I feel like there&#39;s not much else I&#39;ll be able to call you besides &quot;Creep&quot; or &quot;Bag-o-Bones.&quot; No offense, Sister. But he is weird. And that&#39;s from a Saint.&quot;

This was another surprise to Marcus, something that he didn’t have the knowledge of potentially existing. Something outside of the seven classes he was even marginally familiar with. They were an agent for the holy grail itself, or so they said. How willing they would be to serve that greater purpose and not their own was still in question.  There was that ever present hunger which seemed to permeate from their being, which brought a slight feeling of unease to the necromancer. 

“It’s not, I agree. But there’s only so much you lot can do in the time remaining. This optimization may be shoddy at best.” The coroner was face to face with his own lifeless eyes. Staring into the inky reflection of the ruler’s helmet. Before the reflection was brought away and he was staring towards Christopher once again. 

Lancer spoke more about the necessity to only have those involved directly in the war be those who are damaged by it. Along with digging into Marcus’s own potentially selfish motives for his wish. He only gave a distant look towards his servant, not giving an inch into his own personal thought process. Then it was brought to the focus of Rosula. 

“I’ll cooperate with my servant, to the best of our abilities protect the innocents.” It was a half truth at best, a lie at worst. “Sister, I hope to any god that will listen that your brothers and Ruler, truly can handle this.” 

Within their shared mental connection Marcus shot a quick message. “I thought you didn’t want to talk that much, here? Yet it looks like something sparked passion for you.” The necromancer didn’t even break eye contact from Sister Rosula. Prodding deeper into his Servant’s personal thought process, if he would even share at a time like this.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092230606525579415 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092230606525579415><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 6:34 PM">6:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the obvious insult, they didn&#39;t appear bothered in the slightest, as if they found it fun to play up Christopher&#39;s words even more. Instead, they reached into their sleeves and pulled out more candy, letting them tumble onto their lap in a cascade of colors and shapes.

&#39;Hmm, a snack for you...&#39; The child picked through their bountiful offerings, until they finally found what they were looking for — a mini, already opened pack of M&amp;Ms.

They held up the solitary packet of chocolate to Christopher, dropping it onto their open palm. It felt awfully light, as if someone had already eaten most of the chocolate inside.

How stingy!

Ruler then turned to Marcus, this time holding a piece of gum in their hand. &#39;It&#39;s only fair that you get something too,&#39; they said, balancing the gum on the Coroner&#39;s palm.

&#39;Optimization is not your primary concern as a Master. Your focus should be on fighting and winning with all your heart. Leave the optimization to your Servant and me!&#39; They pointed towards themselves. &#39;After all, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. <strong>Collecting data, analyzing it, and dissecting it thoroughly is my forte. And with a bit of improvisation, we can all arrive at a <em>desirable</em> future.</strong>&#39;

They looked up towards Lancer, almost expectantly so, and waited for him to dig into his paltry snack: inside the packet he&#39;d been given was a single, blue M&amp;M.

&#39;See? Your favorite,&#39; they said proudly as if they had just proved a point, then added, &#39;You can always call me Ruler, if you prefer. Although, I must admit, I have recently developed a fondness for the name Astroboy. Television is really fun! I had no idea robots can fly through space now.&#39;

...It was difficult to tell whether they were joking or not with the helmet on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A Saint?

She looked up once more at Lancer&#39;s beastly form, her mind racing. She was familiar with Saint Christopher, the patron saint of travelers, but had never heard of him being associated with wolves. Could this be a new revelation, or perhaps just a misunderstanding?

Regardless, Lancer&#39;s presence now held a new meaning to her, and his previous actions took on a different light. She tried to regain her composure and addressed the Saint directly.

&#39;Forgive me for my rudeness, but are you truly Saint Christopher?&#39; She asked the giant of a man. &#39;And if so, might there be another reason for your visit to our church?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092539849975812206 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092539849975812206><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 3, 2023 3:03 PM">3:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Wha...one...?&quot; 

A single blue M&amp;M. Well, whether he was a servant or not, he was still a child it seems. Willing to share, but only if it meant a portion of the horde. Face fallen slightly out of annoyance, Christopher popped the M&amp;M into his mouth, only slightly perturbed at how the boy even knew his favorite color...

It seemed his Master was taken with Ruler, learning their role to play in the war. &quot;Well, it just so happens something interesting piqued my interest. Like how there&#39;s at least 2 other Lancers for us to worry about,&quot; he responded, tartly from how quickly he finished his treat. Then, Sister Rosula spoke...

&quot;Uh...it&#39;s okay. I know I&#39;m not the prettiest face, but yeah. I&#39;m Christopher the Christ Bearer.&quot; 

He only flicked his glance in her direction, Lancer himself unable to directly look at her in the face. He instinctively closed his hood tighter around his face, as he figured his appearance was making the good sister uncomfortable. The fact he was so flustered did leave him grumbling under his breath, unable to shake just how ridiculous and childish he was being with her. The pang in his chest just wouldn&#39;t allow any different. 

&quot;....I just haven&#39;t been in a church in a long time...actually, no, I shouldn&#39;t lie to a nun,&quot; he said, sighing as his shoulders slumped. &quot;I...hadn&#39;t been in a church ever. I just wanted to be inside of one...see how it looked...see if I was anywhere...&quot; 

So that&#39;s what it was. A slightly vain notion? Did he wish to be revered like his fellow saints? Or...maybe, did he simply wish to know if he was considered the same as them...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092542504005533790 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092542504005533790><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 3, 2023 3:13 PM">3:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Improvisation, also. Eh.&quot; Marcus simply responded. Standing and making his way away from where their group were congregated. &quot;I&#39;ll be leaving now. Lancer stay and converse as long as you&#39;d like. I have preparations to make, and its about time I have a smoke&quot; 

Within their shared connection between servant and master, the necromancer responded. &quot;Understood. There is quite the concern with just that alone. I wonder how many of the other classes may be summoned. Perhaps try and tease that out.&quot; The peace of loneliness finally  settled upon the coroner as he exited the church&#39;s interior. No longer weighed down by the suffocating nature of the holy building. Marcus produced his coin. 

Then a pack of cigarettes from his other pocket. Taking a quick light and staring out before him. Thoughts of a happier version of himself surfaced. Finally fulfilling a promise to go see the world, for his sake. Just as soon as that wave of warmth crossed his mind that ever present depression chilled it as the cigarette burned away.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092547182353186827 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092547182353186827><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 3, 2023 3:32 PM">3:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...I don&#39;t...have any pictures? In any church?&quot; 

Marcus had left Christopher alone. It was probably better that way, as Lancer likely didn&#39;t need the coroner to see him so utterly dumbfounded. Aimless. What did he mean...

He looked back to Rosula, who carefully laid a hand on Astroboy&#39;s helmet, the boy himself only too quick to try and grab her attention. To steer her eyes back to him...

&quot;...Uh, right. Yeah...I only really carried him...&quot; 

The revelation from Ruler worked to shut Lancer back inside of himself. He gazed back to the altar, where the lone image of Jesus on the cross brought him back to nights on open roads looking for such crosses, using them as a means to guide him from travel to travel. Journey post to post. 

&quot;Sister, can you talk instead of him? You&#39;ve at least heard of me...right?

She noticed Lancer&#39;s crestfallen look upon hearing her words, and couldn&#39;t help but feel a twinge of sympathy for him.

&#39;But remember,&#39; she continued, offering him a reassuring smile. &#39;Even if we don&#39;t have any depictions of you here, that doesn&#39;t diminish your status as a patron saint.

Either way, it was a small solace to hear Sister Rosula speak in such a way. 

&quot;Right...well, I&#39;ll take it.&quot; He spoke, gruffly, but with a small rise in his shoulders that could be seen in his swagger as he rose to his feet. He made his way to the nave, regarding both sister and Astroboy with a nod before he turned back to the entrance. 

&quot;I guess I should be going. It was a pleasure to meet you, Sister. I hope I can speak with you again before the end of this war...if at all. Astroboy...you&#39;re stingy. Next time, give me at least more than one.&quot; 

He had so much more to say, but, famously, he had no way of actually forming the words. If nothing else, he was sure Ruler could tell what he was thinking, so maybe it was best to keep it hidden from Rosula&#39;s own ears. He didn&#39;t trust the child. About as much as a Servant could trust Ruler. But the way it clung to Rosula, took her attention. He wasn&#39;t sure what they&#39;ve talked about before...but he had the suspicion it was something that would keep the Sister from letting them go. 

<em>I&#39;m not much of a Saint if I don&#39;t watch over my Master. But he&#39;ll be fine. For now...I&#39;d really like a chance to see this new world with my own eyes. And see these new people before this war starts.</em>

&quot;And I meant what I said,&quot; Lancer spoke once more, a sideways glance back down the hall, his eyes a pale blue orb peeking through a shroud of darkness. &quot;It&#39;s cliche, sure...but this war is between heroes from the past and Mages who wish for something beyond this worlds capabilities. No one else should have to suffer from it...and I will do my best to make sure that&#39;s true.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092850222964682825 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092850222964682825><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 11:36 AM">11:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
