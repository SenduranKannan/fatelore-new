Vroomshshshsh

The roars of an engine of an old ferry boat travelling down the Nile River filled the air with background noise. It was annoying to some, others were indifferent towards it, while others found comfort in it. They didn&#39;t need to focus on whatever was on their mind with the noise in the air.

It had been close to a month since he left his home and made his way towards Egypt. Thanks to previous favours he accumulated over the years, he managed to acquire a safe passage to <strong>Berenice</strong> under the guise of opening up a fake new storefront. All the paperwork took time to be finalized. That, and the person he needed to find wasn&#39;t the easiest to track down either. Of course, construction of the new store will never be completed. All James needed was a place to lay low until he finished what he came here for. 

A cigarette hung between the fingers of his hand as he leaned on the railing to watch the hazy horizon. With his preoccupied his mind was, he was losing more of his cigarette to idle thoughts than what he actually smoked! 

God, the heat might just be the end of him before he even makes it to Berenice!

His thoughts were interrupted when the voice of another snapped him out of it.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 11:55 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

We&#39;ll be arriving soon. I thought you might find this interesting.&quot; 

The tall, well-kept man that handed James was Oswald Tisdale, his brother-in-law. He was in charge of the ferry bringing James over to Berenice.

The paper in question was an Egyptian News paper with translation notes and certain points highlighted:
<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Officials say nearly 50% of the country’s electricity was cut for several hours; at least 10 people died and...
</div></div>It was regarding the power outrages that occurred August 31st, 1999 throughout the entirety of Egypt. It was an event that stirred up quite the panic and outrage with the people. The more James read on the notes provided, the more he understood what it all meant.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t take a prodigy to know what all that means, James. <strong>It means there could be Masters out there who managed to already summon their Servants.</strong> What else could cause such a freak accident like that?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 11:53 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I understand.&quot;

With the last bit of the notes read, James folded the papers and kept it on his person. It might be useful later on after all. There was no bell to signal the start of the Holy Grail War. No grace period. No gentleman&#39;s agreement to let the other be prepared. Once there, people will be hunting for him. He needed to summon his Servant as soon as he can so he isn&#39;t caught in the open without one. 

&quot;Thanks for this by the way.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A simple sound of affirmation followed by a slight nod was made before he returned to his post, leaving James to his thoughts again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A small chime was rung once he entered the faux storefront that would be his for the time being, courtesy of Oswald, of course. It was dusty, in desperate need for repairs, and looked like it hasn&#39;t been lived in for a few months now. So, in other words, it was perfect. 

James placed his suitcase behind the counter and entered the backroom. It was a small living space with the bed presumably upstairs. The smell had a certain musk about the place. He didn&#39;t care to find out what was the source of it. Nothing that could make that smell could be a pleasant thing to find.

Luckily, there was storage room off to the side where he keep his stock, if he was actually serious about this store, of course. That room would provide the perfect space he needed to perform the ritual however. 

&quot;No time to waste.&quot;

So, he went to take out the supplies from his suitcase to slowly, but carefully, made the essential preparations. There was a sight that froze James in his tracks once he looked inside though; it was Mister Fluffybuns. Right. His loyal protector. Well, he can&#39;t go protecting him inside the suitcase. Some spare thread was used to tie the doll to his belt so it was on his person at all times, for his daughter&#39;s sake, of course. Now it was time to get to work.

The circle had to be done a few times over inside of the storage room since he messed up but he eventually got it down. Or as close as he thinks is passable that is. 

&quot;First, the circle. Then the catalyst.&quot;
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084456066353479743 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084456066353479743><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 7:41 AM">7:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>James placed the shaft of what appeared to be scepter in the middle of the summoning circle. It was the best his money could afford in such short notice. It was dated to be around the Mid-15th Century A.D. There were plenty of well-named rulers and kings during that time. It was a safe bet to make. A Saber would grant him peace of mind after all.

&quot;Next, the blood.&quot;

James stood close to the perimeter of the circle in front of them. His hand was stretched out over it with one of his Silver Nails in the other hand. He wasn&#39;t sure if it had to be his or not. Not like he had another source nearby to use anyways. 

<em>stab</em>

The crimson flow ebbs from his hand and onto the circle. The moment the red ichor landed inside one of the many circles of the ritual site, James felt a pulse emanate from within. The leylines pulsated as if it were alive. No turning back now. James kept his still bleeding hand that held his command seals over the rim of the circle and began his chant.

&quot;Let my voice cross the boundaries beyond so it could be heard...&quot;

Like a heartbeat, the ground rumbled ever so slightly.

&quot;Heed my call and feel my innermost desire. Allow me to be your anchor that serves to bind you to the present...&quot; 

Each line spoken brought forth more energy out of James and poured it into the circle. Sweat began to drip from his forehead as his body was drained of his mana the longer he spent with this chant. It kept draining him until James reached the end of the incantation. 

&quot;Submit to the beckoning of the Holy Grail. If you will submit to this will and reason...&quot;

&quot;Then answer! <strong>Come Forth!</strong>&quot;

Whichever <s>Saber</s> Servant answered his call, he knew that he would need to place his trust in them...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084456069511790612 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084456069511790612><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 7:41 AM">7:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Already, with the wonder of the ancient ritual casting the room&#39;s palette in a deep color and letting everything around him be hung in seeming spite of gravity, the final burst of wind served to punctuate it all.  The circle glowed one more time, ending in a brilliant flash, before ending its show and returning to its dull, muted tone.

Ultimately, it was a grand spectacle that served to underscore something far more disappointing.

Crouched in the middle of this circle was something slight, huddled together underneath a dark red cloak.  It stirred, and rose, revealing its form as feminine, strange, and...leaving much to be desired.  This did not appear to be a king of old or some great hero who had made their legend through conquest, no, for those beings were made by God to be twice as large as this one.  Already, as she stood up, it was clear that this Servant was quite short - she didn&#39;t even reach James&#39; shoulders standing up.  If some kind of hidden strength lie in this woman, it wasn&#39;t readily apparent with how twiggy and unassuming her body was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084543529730199582 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084543529730199582><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 1:28 PM">1:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This lack of stature was only made worse by how she seemed to stoop over, her back arched and her head hanging forward in an odd posture that she would maintain throughout this first meeting of theirs.

Her eyes caught the faint light of this storage room in a bright yet cold blue...as did her grin, which only grew more toothy and smug as she regarded the man before him.  Her eyes grew half-lidded and she seemed to stifle a laugh before speaking.

&quot;...my, what terrible misfortune!  Of everyone who may have come to your summons, it was me who answered.&quot;  She shrugged her little shoulders, drawing out...the haft of a scepter, upon the head of which was born the knit image of her own face.  The wand of a court fool, which she tapped at her shoulder once and twice.  The mocking tone in her voice grew as she added &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can try again for someone better, my Master?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The burst of wind nearly threw James off his feet. His wounded hand shielded his face from the intense concentration of mana that has gathered forth. He did it. He actually managed to summon forth a Servant! It was surprisingly much easier than he thought. Of course, the exhaustion was more than enough to get him second guessing about doing it a second time though.

James recovered slowly and stared outwards in front of him to meet the eyes of... the wall? That can&#39;t be right! But alas, it was true, for the jingles that rang from the little bells from the figure&#39;s hat brought his eyes further down. Man, they were so... <em><strong>small</strong></em>.

The expression on his face couldn&#39;t be mistaken for anything but flabbergasted. He thought Servants were suppose to be awe-inspiring! Where was the grandeur! Where was the heroic presence! <em>Why did he get someone so uncool!</em>

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be joking...&quot; James proclaimed before he stared up at the ceiling, for this clearly was a cruel joke from a higher power. &quot;...Why me?&quot; That was his singular question. As expected however, it would go unanswered by God, The Throne, or any other power potentially behind this for that matter. For better or worse, <em>this</em> was the hand he was dealt.

Well, the ritual wasn&#39;t over, unfortunately. There were still steps that needed to be done; mainly the forming of the contract.

It didn&#39;t help that his first Servant came with such an attitude though! &quot;Ugh... As much as I would like to, we don&#39;t have the luxury of a second summon. I only had the one catalyst, after all...&quot; That last bit was spoken under his breath while he rubbed the temples of his head with one hand before bringing his gaze down to meet hers.

Were it my guess, oh Master, either you are simply that unlucky...or even worse, it&#39;s simply your lot as an insufficient mage.

She laughed.  It was the sort of laugh befitting of someone who had so much wind in their lungs to devote to petty insults.  Loud and raucous and full-bodied, she placed her free hand across her stomach as she leaned backward, and took a few seconds to get through it all.

With his confirmation of their contract, as unbreakable as could be, she hopped over from her position to perch upon a cardboard box - barely bending it even though she put her whole weight upon it.  With a grand flourish of her wand, she pointed forward, and her tone became grandiose, her pitch deeper.  &quot;Who am I?  Why, I am Julius Caesar, builder of the greatest civilization of wolf-obsessed penetrators ever known!&quot;  She flipped herself nimbly, performing a handstand that placed her legs both upward.  &quot;Or perhaps I am the beatified Saint Peter, whose greatest &#39;feet&#39; was having his toes pointing towards God as he was crucified.&quot;  She lay down at rest upon the box, her eyes rolling upward and almost back into her head.  &quot;You know what, looking at me I must be Pepin the Short, a Carolingian whose finest achievement was letting forth the bastard son Charlemagne, issued from his loins, unto the world.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084700133536575550 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084700133536575550><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 11:51 PM">11:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Looking back at him, she lay across the box in a more languid position, hands placed on her chest.

Beyond her strange and tight-fitting attire, there was a not-unnoticeable accent that pretty well placed her somewhere in the vicinity of France.  Not that it was much help.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Normally, he could just leave or ignore the person completely in situations like this. This wasn&#39;t just some normal situation however. That luxury was out of the question the moment he stepped on this already cursed island. 

<em>&quot;Why, I am Julius Caesar...&quot;</em>

Unless the Throne was calling Caesar a huge joke, this was extremely unlikely. The further theatrics brought no changes to his expression. Such a tough crowd! He was still dealing with this reality, which he still doubted was actually real, after all. Halfway into the show, James flipped through the book that taught him about the basics of Servants and summoning to see if he really could try again, to no avail, sadly. 

Once Assassin laid down on the box and asked James her question, he approached her and knelt down with his arm on one leg so he could be more at face-level with her, though, even with the box and him kneeling down, it was still difficult to do so. James opened his mouth to spea-

<em>bonk</em>

A light thud was heard as he <s>so brutally assaulted</s> tapped the book against her head lightly. Hopefully that would knock some sense into her. &quot;Let me guess; the <strong>World&#39;s Most Annoying Jester</strong>?&quot; It would be his luck that out of all the heroes in the world that he would be landed with a Jester out of all of things!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084925388960055427 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084925388960055427><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 2:46 PM">2:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet.  Were it so, she wouldn&#39;t twirl around and insult him so vigorously, you would imagine - the most brilliant of jokes could appear as insanity when played to an audience of brick and mortar, naturally!  Somewhere in that head of hers, there was a hope - no, an inevitability, that this one would crack.  People who fancied themselves as wizards are used to bitter taunting from the sane, after all.

Upon the violence from Master to Servant, it did seem for a moment as if Assassin had been surprised by the ambush.  She stopped, eyes wide, and looked up at the book as it was drawn away from her forehead...and then she pressed a hand to it, reeling backward as if struck a mortal blow.  &quot;The pain!  To have been cut down naught but minutes into this war of ours...Master, was I not good enough...?&quot;

With a cheeky smile she pulled up her scepter and drew a hand across its length - it changed into a small pile of golden glitter, which she sprinkled over her body to really set in that this was the end.

Whether or not James was crying in regret, she sat up, casting a bit of glitter into the air with her movement, so that she was actually eye to eye with the much taller man.  &quot;I believe you are correct, Master.  Though, it does not encompass the totality of my untarnished shittiness!&quot;  She placed a hand over her chest.  &quot;Were I only annoying, I would not be remembered.  For I am also pitifully weak, cruel and spiteful, incompetent, hated and immoral...and the most dreadful of all things...<em>French.&quot;</em>  She said that last grave sin in a hushed tone, so that no other ears would have that abomination of a word fall upon them and go deaf in turn.

&quot;With all of those qualities, there is only one person I could be.  Triboulet.&quot;  She looked up to him expectantly, her arms held out wide in a flourish after her announcement.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t going to lie to himself. There was a part of him that kind of wished that blow was all it took. Anything to end this cruel joke on his luck. 

&quot;...I am not cleaning that up.&quot;

Some of it landed on him once she got up, giving the two of them the single similarity between the two; that they both have glitter on them. 

&quot;<em>...French.</em>&quot;

If this wasn&#39;t during a situation where he could very well lose his life trying to obtain what seems like an impossible wish, he would give her that one. That one was pretty good. However, this wasn&#39;t that kind of situation where he could afford to simply laugh. At least, that&#39;s what he believed in at the moment. 

Then came the reveal of her name...

&quot;Who?&quot;

His eyes narrowed behind his shades as if to analyze whether or not she was telling the truth this time or just pulling a name out of her ass. While difficult to notice, the facial muscles did give enough of a hint away. Who could actually manage to become a powerful being like a Servant with the name <em>&#39;Triboulet&#39;</em>? It <em>had</em> to be another one of her jokes.

&quot;Fine. <em>Triboulet</em>, what&#39;s your Class anyways? Caster? Casters are said to be rather weak after all.

At some point between snark, pointless theatrics and the exposition of your familiar, when you next notice it the glitter had disappeared and the scepter had returned to her possession.  Strange thing it was.  How it&#39;d ever truly help someone in a martial competition - it looked like it&#39;d be best utilized if the opponent had some kind of textile allergy - was unknown.

What was a much more vicious blow than the strike at her head was the way he seemed to just simply <em>say</em> &quot;Who?&quot; like that.  No wondering, no hesitation!  Triboulet didn&#39;t recoil in pain like before, but immediately, her arms dropped from their previous flourish and she lost her grin like it was never there.  &quot;Worse than I thought, then.  T&#39;was a name of renown, of adoration among the common folk, the reading man...and it&#39;s just slipped like that, huh?&quot;

She looked upward briefly, away from his face, before looking back down at him with some renewed cheer.  &quot;Haha, I suppose it&#39;s only fitting for a wretch like me.  What use has the world for hunchbacked old dwarves?  Probably even less than they did before!  Let me be forgotten,&quot; she held up her hand, &quot;we are all better off for it - the <em>last</em> thing I wish to remember is myself.&quot;

&quot;But, to answer your question,&quot; she suddenly appeared to be holding a knife which was held directly in front of her face and not too far away from James&#39;, &quot;I am a base Assassin.  Strange, no?  The greatest of all court comedians in history and I am made to be a blackguard holding a dagger in the street as the man draws home.  Why is there no &#39;Artist&#39; class for souls like us...&quot;

She crossed her arms and nodded, and the knife was safely removed from his personal space.  &quot;I&#39;ve already told you I was a weakling and a little milksop, so temper your expectations, much like your mother had to.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once he finds the time to, he should really look her up to see what he can glimpse online. Even if it means using one of those damned computers... Why can&#39;t they make them more simpler to understand! 

The dreaded thought about needing to navigate his way around a computer left his mind quick enough that he almost got whiplash the moment the knife was drawn from her. Shit! He let his guard down for a second and now he was effectively at knife-point! Maybe he underestimated her more than he should&#39;ve.

&quot;<em>Assassin</em>. I&#39;ll keep that in mind then.&quot; Thankfully the knife was withdrawn, allowing him to stand back up with moderate comfort. Whether she meant it or not, she can be surprisingly scary. Thus is the nature of a Servant he thought. 

&quot;You have quite the mouth on you, huh?...&quot; A sigh ended off his sentence as the man resorted to rubbing his temples once again to suppress the onset of the headache he can feel rising. At least the glitter is gone. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what your expectations of me are but you being an Assassin might actually be better for me. We can lay low and keep to ourselves until we need to strike. Let the heavy hitters take each other out, or something like that.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085244363501736017 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085244363501736017><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 11:53 AM">11:53 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That seems quite possible.&quot;  Then, she closed her eyes and tilted her noggin.  &quot;You&#39;re lucky you have me and my mindfulness.  Though I&#39;m a simpleton without compare, at least one of us must exhibit this level of critical thinking if we&#39;ll survive.&quot;

Removing herself from the box, this would probably mark the last time the two of them would ever be on equal height.  She paced around the room, looking between whatever caught her eye of this fake store&#39;s wares (what did this place even sell, anyhow?) and the scattered debris cast about by the summoning ritual.  Though she walked with an odd gait and a noticeable arcing of her back - not just a pose, it seemed like a more permanent issue of posture - she stepepd nimbly without so much as disturbing a single mote of dust, and without a single crack or creak.

&quot;What I expect of you, oh Master, is for you to either go and shirk all responsibilities in this lost cause and act the part of a true bacchanalist - this land of ours seems ripe for that sort of meandering - or to guide me as you see fit.  Surely you know what&#39;s best between us, until proven otherwise.&quot;

&quot;Shall I always listen to your sound judgment?&quot;  She smiled, and nodded.  &quot;No!  But if you&#39;re a Master, it&#39;s your job to whip your Servant when the little rat goes against your will.  Abuse to your heart&#39;s content, that&#39;s the wont of all higher-ups.&quot;  She mimed this supposed dynamic out herself as she described it, tying an imaginary rope around her neck and jumping up slightly as its invisible handler yanked the leash along.  &quot;A sense of humor would help, but since you clearly have <em>none</em> of that, cruelty&#39;s all you can rest upon.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085285934414700544 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085285934414700544><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 2:38 PM">2:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Already,&quot; she released the imaginary noose around her neck and stumbled to the ground, &quot;you&#39;re going to have to beat some sense into me: Assassin I might be, but laying low?

It was much too varied to be one specific store. It must&#39;ve been a general goods store that sold whatever essentially. At least, that is what the items gave the idea of.

He took note of her pose and wondered if it was just another act. It didn&#39;t seem overexaggerated like her other actions were which led him to believe it wasn&#39;t one. If it was, she definitely fooled him there. The most curious part of it, however, was the fact that she left absolutely no trace behind.

The more he listened to her, the more he was expecting a punchline or joke to end it all off. Instead, he was met with the oddly pleasant surprise of nothing more than just <em>actual advice</em>. It took him for a loop that he stood there in a stupor for a bit before he realized how long he was pondering upon her words. She was right. He wasn&#39;t that great of a Magi. Nor was he that capable in battle as someone from his wife&#39;s side of the family. His Servant didn&#39;t cover up for much either. They were up shit creek. There was no way around that fact. 

&quot;You&#39;re right. If we&#39;re caught we might as well just call it quits there, huh?&quot; The sigh that left his lips made it sound like he was resorting to resigning right then and there. The fact he took out a cigarette as if to smoke his last only further pushed that point. Using his index and middle fingers, a quick flick of Magecraft allowed his fingertips to heat up enough to lit his cigarette. After a long drag to perform some kind of life-shortening breathing technique, he held it between his fingers and turned to face Assassin. 

&quot;I&#39;m not much of an abuser, so instead I&#39;ll ask this; <strong>what do you think we should do in that case?</strong> A few more places to hideout might be a good move to make as well. We would be too easy to find if we keep coming back here.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085418790826823710 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085418790826823710><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 11:26 PM">11:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If only it was with a joke!  She tapped the scepter against her arm once, then twice, and looked into its button eyes.  She whispered <em>&quot;I promise, I shan&#39;t ever be useful again,&quot;</em> but did not receive an answer from it.

&quot;If we&#39;re going to &#39;call it quits&#39;,&quot; she said in response, turning her back to him and pulling her hat from her head, &quot;we might as well end it right here and right now.  I mean, death&#39;s inevitable - for you, at least - so why not just end it on our own terms?&quot;  With one practiced slip of the foot and then a soft thump, she landed on top of a dislodged rug with her hat across her chest and the scepter now a bouquet of white flowers.  In repose, she said &quot;Maybe they won&#39;t attack us if they think we&#39;ve died.&quot;

A slightly more serious tone overtook her, though she remained laying in state.  &quot;What I know and what I think are a bit at odds, my good sir.  What I know is that this war is a battle of mages, and that this war was not announced yesterday.  Quite some time ago, presumably, that&#39;s how the Church likes it.  What I don&#39;t know is this: how much do mages enjoy preparing for potentialities?&quot;

&quot;They could have taken this island of Berenice and its attendant Aswan and laid it with as many spell-works to surveil and spy as possible.  Because, my guess is that mages <em>adore</em> preparation, because they have absolutely nothing going on in their lives - they&#39;re all stuck studying and burning their eyes out over books that these scholarly bastards take busywork as a joyful activity.  And by God, I must be looking at the best example of such.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085450897276010576 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085450897276010576><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 1:34 AM">1:34 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; she pointed up at him but remained in her imaginary coffin, &quot;<em>looking at you,</em> they must know who you are already, right?

If there were Masters already here, they could&#39;ve had familiars or Magecraft already in place to spy on any potential arrivals. It wasn&#39;t like he blended in either. He definitely would&#39;ve stuck out to any observant eye watching. How safe was this place really in that case?

Thankfully he already had a smoke in his hand, otherwise he would have lit up another one because of that revelation. His nerves were calmed down a bit with each drag but that didn&#39;t help the looming feeling of dread over his head.

He wasn&#39;t afforded much time to linger on those thoughts however due to the repeated jabs made by his Assassin at him. &quot;I&#39;ll have you know that <em>this</em>...&quot; A quick comb-through was made with his hand. &quot;...is considered attractive in a man. A lot has changed since whatever time period Jesters were still considered cool, you know.&quot; With that, he went back to enjoying hi- wait a minute. Was that actually a jab back at her? Weak, sure, but still.

A box with the label &#39;stationery&#39; sat on a shelf next to James that caught his attention in the corner of his eye. That could work.

&quot;Well, if others are already setting up their own spy networks, we better set up our own then.&quot; A few sheets of papers were pulled from the box and dusted off. James knelt down and crumbled the papers together in his hands before using some Magecraft. A few chants were spoken quietly into the crumbled ball of paper. After the last lines were spoken, he opened his hands to reveal paper butterflies that became to flutter with diamond-shaped wings in air. &quot;They ain&#39;t much, but they will get the job done at least.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085625500493434951 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085625500493434951><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 1:08 PM">1:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The jester laughed in response, whether she ignored the slight against her profession or enjoyed it, and this proved enough to rouse her from death a second time.  &quot;Let me tell you: keeping a whole mink cape on your chin was just as fashionable back then, but it was limited to queer strangers crawling among streets named <em>Merdeux</em> and <em>Merdiere,</em> and the nobility who could dress themselves however they pleased.  After all, it didn&#39;t matter how ugly they were, for they couldn&#39;t be refused!&quot;

She walked up to his side and placed a hand over her mouth in mock conspiratorial whisper, though barely, as the height difference would&#39;ve made a real one inaudible.  &quot;And let me tell you all the same: the Jester, the <em>bouffon,</em> was never very cold.  We all wear these tight woolen things and stay in the heady midst of the court all day.  The last thing we ever were was &#39;cool&#39;.&quot;

The creation of the familiars did seem to get her attention in a slightly more positive way.  She watched them for a few moments with a bit of amusement on her face, leaning against a shelf as they floated past and around - the most she did against these little constructions of paper and will was gently push them away with her wand if they got too close to her face.  &quot;We can only hope that our opponents are not scholars of the insect world - the sort who find themselves jabbing the things onto boards like rows of crucified criminals.  Either the deception would be found, or they&#39;ll claim it as a discovery of science.  My, we&#39;d be in <em>real</em> trouble then.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085655973986828288 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085655973986828288><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 3:09 PM">3:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;However!&quot;  She held up a finger, which was briefly alighted upon by another pseudo-butterfly before she shook it off.  &quot;You are forgetting me.  For what use am I beyond my awful humor and having two functioning eyes?  Send me out there, because until you&#39;ve given away yourself you might as well be a non-entity, and I am like a thief in the night.  Never shall I be caught, and never shall I die!&quot;

This was accompanied with a great twirl of the cape that she held out at its ends like the wings of a bat.  Once again, seeing someone who looks like they&#39;re liable to be blown over by a strong wind claim immortality seemed off.  &quot;Though maybe I&#39;ll die if I find a truly humorous reason to do it.  That&#39;d be the ultimate in dedication of the craft...and maybe I&#39;d get to really have that talk with Death.&quot;

Drawing her cape back around her and then silently hopping up, so that she was...on top of his shoulders, looking down upon him, provided he didn&#39;t immediately shake her off.  Now he could feel that she wasn&#39;t as insubstantial as earlier had suggested, there was a weight pressing down on him, but it was probably not much more than a child trying for a piggyback ride.  &quot;You should take me and point me where you shall, but be smart about it - if you&#39;re capable of intelligence.  I&#39;d just be sightseeing if I had the whole city to cover, and already, I can smell the stench from here.  Save me the trouble of stepping in dung <em>too</em> many times...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Well, by then, we&#39;d have got what we wanted; that being where they are. That&#39;s all you need to get the jump on someone.&quot; The butterflies flew almost aimlessly in the air. What good were flying familiars if they didn&#39;t see? While that may appear to be the case for a second or two, they soon came to rest upon nooks and and alcove they could find. Except to the cautiously aware, they could easily be glanced over as part of the scenery. They can&#39;t stay forever and will need to be replaced, of course. Nearly perfect for spies and scouts. Maybe not as good as their other option, however.

While he didn&#39;t trust that she could hold her own in a fight against something like a Knight Class, Assassins were usually unmatched in another aspect; espionage. Soon they were gathering positive after positive to help outweigh the negatives. They were nowhere near balancing them out, of course, but it was a start.

The sudden weight of his shoulder almost made him tumble. A single glance upwards brought another sigh once he figured out who invaded his personal space. Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t that much, which was oddly surprisingly but he wasn&#39;t going to question stuff like Servants and their weighs. He had <em>some</em> tact after all.

&quot;Fine. I&#39;m sure we can find a map in here somewhere. Or I can go out and get one and we can begin to plot out where we should look for any hideouts, bounded fields, or individuals who stick out a bit too much.&quot; Figuring it&#39;d be easier to just walk around with her on his shoulders, he started his search around the storeroom.

The strange combination of Servant and Master formed a moving tower, dull stone at its base and a grossly colorful dome at the top.  The peak of their assembly bobbed to the sides and maintained balance effortlessly as James walked around, even having to crouch and bend forward to keep from swiping the lamps above.  &quot;We&#39;re both plenty unfamiliar already - we&#39;d sooner appear as itinerants in this land, skin, hair, clothes and all.  Look for people like us, I suppose?  Mages seem like an rich and eccentric bunch, at least.  If I see someone who introduces themselves with a,&quot; she takes on a deep voice and an aristocratic English accent, &quot;&#39;The <em>pleasure</em> is all <em>mine,</em> madame&#39;, I can suppose I&#39;ve found a good candidate for murder.&quot;

Initially the search would be fruitless, probably made difficult in that bending down and getting back up was all the more tiresome with a living piece of trash burdening down, but ultimately this pain would serve him well.  On the highest shelf, cluttered behind a couple of aging tourist-oriented books, the newest one marked as &#39;showing you all the hottest events you can find in Egypt this year of 1985&#39; was the slight iridescence of plastic, and she reached forward to grab it.

&quot;A-ha.  Let me reveal the secrets of this place to you, blind Master.&quot;

She unfolded it and held it out for him, mercifully to his side so that he wasn&#39;t blinded.  In her hand was a laminated map, though already its protective slip had yellowed with age, and it was marked in English and undoubtedly meant for tourists.  Nevertheless, it was at least decently detailed, showing most of the landmarks of Berenice and laying out the major streets of the island.  Some of these places may have changed with the passing decade or two between its creation and its unearthing, but it&#39;s difficult to imagine that a church or an archaeological site would&#39;ve been moved since.

&quot;What is a KFC?  Something-or-rather College?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was no balancing act they needed to do together so he could really just focus on whatever. The worst a fall could do is force him to attend another faux funeral of hers after all. 

Their long, and definitely arduous, task met its end though once the map was found. 

&quot;Oh. I knew there had to be a map of sorts in this damn place. Glad to see we don&#39;t need to go looking for one in the city.&quot; The entirety of Berenice was laid down for them to see, even if the map was close to fifteen years outdated. It shouldn&#39;t bite them in the ass <em>that</em> much. 

&quot;These places seem like good spots to start looking.&quot; A few taps on the map was made for different areas of Berenice which, including the Church, covered a wide area of possible hideouts for Masters. James reached back to pull out an old newspaper detailing the power outages in August to add to their invisible board of information as well. &quot;I&#39;m not sure how helpful this could be, but there was an freak accident awhile back. Maybe one of the Masters might be related? It&#39;s better than nothing.&quot; 

After he set up the second piece of the mystery of where the Masters were, a few places seems to have already caught Assassin&#39;s attention. Oh right. He doubted that she experienced the illustrious glory that the eleven herbs and spices that was <em><strong>KFC</strong></em>. &quot;It&#39;s a place you buy food at. These guys specialize in chicken.&quot; Damnit, he could really go for some right now actually. &quot;You know what? How about you go check out the first location while I go get something from there for us? I am not trusting anything in here to be edible and I could really go for something to eat. We should make it back here around the same time.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086363137697124372 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086363137697124372><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 1:59 PM">1:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She probably knew about as much as Rellum did of the surrounding area, but if she couldn&#39;t simply go out and watch the streets then she really should just fall over and die.  Taking the map back from his hands for a moment to get it down into memory, she added &quot;If that mess is related to this, then the Master must have a terrible, terrible sense of timing.  We&#39;d kill him and he wouldn&#39;t realize it for a week.&quot;  Then, with a satisfied snort, she added &quot;Go out and get yourself killed by him and he&#39;ll go mad; he&#39;ll look all over the place for you and will never take the cup for himself!&quot;

The map was placed across an empty shelf, and she flipped through the newspaper next after James had dispensed with it.  Beyond the outages, there was talk of such things as the weather (<em>if I weren&#39;t already dead, this heat would do me in all the same</em>), reviews of the modern works of culture (<em>not a single mention of works of the stage here...troubling...</em>) and talks of the matters of the current government (<em>they must not deem the country&#39;s court comedian to be important enough to share the same election, hmm</em>), all of which were both elucidating to the state of the new world and mystifying at the same time.  The jester&#39;s curiosity was piqued, though what she really wanted to find out wasn&#39;t going to be found in the written word.  That&#39;d have to wait.

A question of meals brought her attention back to the more physical world.  Chicken.  A familiar food, and the relative mundanity of how he brought it up suggested a similar level of complacency with it - he must be a wealthy man.  &quot;Oh, do you deign me human enough to eat at the same table as you?&quot;  She leaned forward a little just so she could let her face, back to its usual mocking grin.  &quot;I&#39;m honored.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086394206232264766 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086394206232264766><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 4:02 PM">4:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She released him from his punishment of being crushed beneath her as she leaned forward more and rolled off of him, somersaulting across the floor before landing her head directly into the metal beam of a shelf with a loud <em>clang!</em>  Considering how nimble she had shown herself to be prior, to have failed at this kind of acrobatic stunt that a child could do would raise an eyebrow.  That she failed with such precision, timing her roll so that she managed to hit her head <em>perfectly</em> and not knock over the shelf at the same time, suggested she was either gifted in the art of the comic pratfall and just wanted to show off, or deranged, or both.

&quot;That&#39;d be what they&#39;d do to me back then,&quot; she says, keeping her forehead planted on the metal bar and pointing where the welt would be if she wasn&#39;t made of sterner stuff.  &quot;The little afterbirth, eating at the same table as royalty?  Even at the peak of my reputation, it was whatever those pigs threw at me, I&#39;d catch with my mouth.  Even so, it&#39;s difficult to beat the dog-scraps of the Crown!  I&#39;ll be surprised if whatever slop you can dole out is superior.&quot;

&quot;But until then!&quot;  She stood back up to her unimpressive height, and then walked over to the door out of the storage room.  &quot;I shall not plague you with my presence any further.  I shall perform my pointless quest of scouting for the enemy and you, you shall perform the infinitely more important task of procuring chicken for yourself.  Gluttonous bastard.&quot;

With a wave, she vanished into a thin sheen of light playing against the dull fluorescents of the back room, and then disappeared entirely.  James was allowed to exist without that annoying thing in his ear for just a few moments.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A small sound, faintly heard even to the most acute of hearing, was made after she joked about this. Where could it has came from? They were the only ones in the room after all and James was too stoic to even think of reacting to one of her jokes, or was he? Slight chuckle or not, the smoking magi showed little to no signs that it came from him, leading to only speculations and thoughts towards the true culprit. 

His eyes rolled as she made a big deal about the two of them eating together. The last thing he would like to be known for was to be kicked out of a HGW because he neglected his Servant after all. Wait. Do Servants actually need to be fed? Never safe than sorry James thought. Then followed the rather clumsy display of Assassin landing. 

&quot;Fortunately, superior or not, it isn&#39;t that expensive. <s>Actually you can get large meals at KFC for affordable prices for the whole family!</s> It might be best after all to stick to places like those for now. I don&#39;t particularly want to chance it with the local cuisine.&quot; The last place he would want to get attacked by another Master is where he has his pants down after all! 

The sheen of light went and he was left alone in the storage room. For a moment, it all felt like the weirdest fever dream caused by the heat. However, he wasn&#39;t waking up anytime soon. So, he let his body relax and a frustrated sigh followed suit. &quot;The sooner you win this grail war, the sooner you can get rid of her. The sooner you win this grail war, the sooner you can...&quot; He repeated this mantra to himself to hopefully give him the fortitude required to endure this One-Servant comedy act before he went out to get something to eat. These things last about a week at most, right?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087480057645248633 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087480057645248633><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 3:57 PM">3:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was invisible and immaterial, even more than usual with the concealment of her presence.  Free from her Master&#39;s gaze, her smile dropped and disappeared even more completely than her physical form.  It wasn&#39;t as if she had a face when manifesting as a spirit, but still, within her head she felt the same sensations and the same unconscious muscle triggers associated with emotion.

She &quot;stood&quot; at the front door of the shop, staring at the deeply unfamiliar scenery - sand-etched white tile, short buildings of brick and stucco arranged in foreign ways...the arrangement of dust-worn banners that had already been bleached of their colors despite being all-but new, signs in a language she had only just seen for the first time but somehow knew intimately, the teeming passerby and their drudgery.

Carried on invisible wind, she shot her form up to the highest perch she could find in the form of a radio antenna.  From here, the whole world seemed open to her: the scattered dwellings among an interminable amount of sand known as the Sahara to the west, the whole of the endlessly historied Berenice below her feet, and the seemingly endless array of red-and-brown buildings to the east in Aswan proper that formed a civilization to match any she knew in life - these names she knew, if for no other reason than to facilitate her role in this war.  This sight, a grander view than ever afforded to her, even as a resident of the Court and its halls and towers, inspired something within her.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087500852467605615 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087500852467605615><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 5:20 PM">5:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In a different way, she realized that she also awaited the end of this war.

Assassin already felt tired.

Though her vision didn&#39;t dim, she could feel the urge to close her eyes just to see a bit less of this world.  She perched on the antenna like a stooping hawk for some time, invisible to everyone and everything, watching not with the keen interest of a spy but that of someone who only stares onward for lack of anything better to do.  A handful of minutes passed in reality, but it felt like nothing changed from her perspective.

<em>...I suppose I&#39;ve got something to do.</em>  She slid across the air, forcing herself to return to full alertness as she coasted in spirit form toward the first of many points of interest.  <em>Time can be wasted later - I&#39;ve enough of it for now.
