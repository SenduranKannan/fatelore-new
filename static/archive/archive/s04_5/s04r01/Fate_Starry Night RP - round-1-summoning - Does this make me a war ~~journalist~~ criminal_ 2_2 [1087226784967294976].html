And, yet, here he was.

Much too tired to explore the island following a day of trekking through Aswan on foot, Florence had fallen asleep before ever getting the chance to find his footing in Berenice.

The hotel was incredibly nice, with a velvet carpet and glass elevators that ran up and down the interior of the lobby. It was an interesting place, that’s for sure. As nice as it was, however, it wasn’t exactly a great place to take half-dead patients. 

After spending an afternoon in paradise, the doctor had decided that hell came at midnight. His mission was to find a dingy, abandoned building where he could set up shop - more specifically, he wanted to find a place where he could perform the “Rituals of the Asclepieia”, his personal brand of healing magecraft, without getting caught by non-magi. 

He knew there were numerous problems with this plan, ranging from stumbling across the workshop of a hostile master to the fact that Berenice was too nice of a place for that sort of building to be found out in the open, but he couldn’t think of anything better. Healing magecraft was the <em>only</em> form of magecraft he was trained in, meaning magically suggesting the staff and other occupants of his hotel or any other building ignore him bringing patients in was off the table, along with any other sort of arcane tricks.

The first thing the doctor landed on was local knowledge. If there was such a place, the people living here must <em>surely</em> know of it, right? Even if the population of this island was largely foreign, there had to be people that knew it well enough to answer him… though it was likely he’d have to cough up some money to get it. Nothing he was worried about.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087227164476321862 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087227164476321862><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 11:12 PM">11:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>What he <em>was</em> worried about included running into a stray master or servant, or finding himself having stumbled upon a fight. He cared little if he ran into any sort of bandit, since he’d brought nothing but a decent wad of cash with him, something he had plenty of. But a participant in the Holy Grail War would almost certainly be less inclined to let him go. <em>Much</em> less inclined.

Florence shuddered at the thought. Once he’d gotten himself out of his head, the doctor found that his sudden shaking was not only the result of his thoughts, but due to the sudden desert cold. Shaking his head to get back on track, he found that he had stumbled upon the window of some sort of store full of all kinds of knick knacks. A store that still had its lights on. Awesome!

…But where was the entrance? 

Sighing with a shrug, the doctor decided to head down the only path he could see that could possibly lead to a front door - the nearby alleyway.

Just as he step foot in, <strong>he felt his weight suddenly yanked out from beneath him. In the matter of a few seconds, he began to get dragged further down the alleyway by his left foot - which now had a translucent thread of some kind wrapped around it.</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the man’s other hand shone a golden gladius, which came to be pointed at Florence’s neck once he’d been pulled close enough.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The first thing he’d done was stumble NOT upon a fight, NOT upon a local scoundrel, but upon a trap. 

Florence was too shocked to speak. Too shocked to do little more than stare. He knew exactly what was happening.

He watched as his captor’s face ran from smiling excitement, to head-tilting confusion, to red with anger. This guy was all kinds of not good. And the doctor could do nothing about it. He was caught in this guy’s trap, and he was gonna go ahead and finish the job without even so much as checking if he had command seals. A potential issue with wearing gloves all the time. Something he should have thought of that came back to bite him in the ass instead.

Knowing his time was upon him, he’d have closed his eyes if it weren’t for the overwhelming feeling of hostility and anxiety that seemed to thicken the air. Whatever it was frightened him so much that he couldn’t help but allow his eyes to widen.

And he wasn’t the only one, it would seem.

He watched as the expression of the man towering over him went from that of tremendous rage to that of absolute terror. The mage’s head turned as far as it could behind him, after which he began a backhanded swing with his sword… only for his arm to get caught at the elbow mid-swing by the palest hand Florence had ever seen. By the palest <em>man</em> Florence had ever seen.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What a fool you’ve been.”

After closing up their dingy lodge for the night - wiped clean of any other temporary residents that may have been staying there at the same time as them - HH and Wilt had taken to the streets at the ghastly businessman’s behest. Wishing to showcase his “unique” set of skills for his master, the monster that is H. H. Holmes took Wilt out onto the streets, the two becoming one with the crowd in lue of stepping into the shadows as most Assassins would. He had hoped to be able to talk a gullible tourist or two (likely more) into either coming to their hotel or walking along with them to a spot hidden from prying eyes and cameras, but they had been interrupted by the presence of what could only have been another servant, forcing them to move defensively. It was likely that the servant fled on the orders of their master, having located Wilt… but it appeared that whatever trap this dunce had set for Wilt landed him this blue-haired man in a lab coat instead. 

Little did he know that his servant’s little intrusion into their outing would put him in the crosshairs of one of modern history’s most infamous serial killers. He even decided to make it worse for himself, if not unintentionally, by forcing his servant to continue scouting the area rather than having them remain on standby in the case of a fight. There’d be little reason to be here if it meant putting themselves in the path of another servant. It was something HH felt the need to make sure of beforehand, which he had done by utilizing his Presence Concealment to play a little game of Battleship™ with whoever it happened to be, though the time it took to lead his opponent away ended up resulting in this encounter taking place in the middle of the night. Whether or not the Assassin’s delayed hunt was of good fortune to the unfortunate doctor seemingly caught up in all this… even HH was uncertain of that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087227993686032384 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087227993686032384><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 11:15 PM">11:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Despite the obvious insult, HH’s words were polite in tone. He liked to reason with himself that - were he not so polite - he might actually feel bad for his victims. A lie, of course. In all actuality, he did it for the sake of an art he’d refined down to a point. The art of deception.

A mage wasn’t exactly what they were looking for, but the suit-and-tie-bearing serial killer had little reason to be picky with his prey, especially prey that could prove a potential future threat. That being said, the fact that he was holding the arm of this unknown man spoke more than one could ever hope to speak in this moment about what HH was thinking.

If he wanted to kill this unaccompanied master all that badly, he’d have already done so. Not to say he didn’t, of course, but there was something he wanted from this first. A handful of things, really. And this idiot had given him the opportunity to check a few things off of a long list of schemes and to-dos.

What he wanted at this very moment was relatively simple. He would speak while staring directly into the soul of the man he currently had a hold of, but the subject of his words would leave everyone in the alley with a sneaking suspicion that the otherworldly stranger’s words were not meant for his soon-to-be victim.

“Your orders, master?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had watched the short encounter between the two with <em>very</em> little interest. It seemed as though the outcome had been decided before the other had even pulled any punches. He was almost shocked that his Servant would stop the swing of the blade, though his calculated nature would not let free mana go-or perhaps he sympathised with the doctor being one himself.

He slowly approached the group, the sound of his footsteps bouncing off the walls of the alley. He almost casually sipped from the cup of coffee in his hand, as he eyed the two strangers up. Wilt was clearly confident about their situation as it was, his free hand simply resting in his pocket.

The brash white haired man was clearly a magus, and likely the master of the servant who was prowling through the streets of Berenice. The one who was hunting Wilt and his servant down. His grip tightened on his coffee, mostly out of annoyance. He had wandered off without his servant in an attempt to catch Wilt wandering around? He could only hope every other master here would be this easy to beat with only petty tricks like that at his disposal. That left only 5 more or so masters he had to deal with. Things were looking up for the young master.

He maintained his slow approach, removing his hand from his jacket pocket only to push his glasses back up before slithering back into place.

 &quot;Wrong four eyes.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087528296385876111 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087528296385876111><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 7:09 PM">7:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The man in the labcoat was a similarly strange figure. Perhaps some scientist or doctor working some graveyard hour shift at a local hospital? Not all too unbelievable. Bits and pieces of the Holy Grail war seemed to spill out before the man, so it was already Wilt&#39;s duty as a magus to deal with the outsider-but if he was already on the chopping block it wouldn&#39;t be bad to try and extrapolate some information out of him or perhaps even some more victims for he and H.H&#39;s schemes, medical malpractice be damned. Honey would attract flies better than vinegar after all.

He stopped in his tracks, just barely out of the splash zone as he nodded to his servant. The intention was clear, but quickly he added an addendum- not wanting to waste a perfectly fine opportunity.

&quot;Deal with the armed one.&quot;

He doubted the Master&#39;s ability to stop Assassin in any capacity, just more fuel to the pyre of mana that his Servant had selflessly constructed. He turned towards the doctor, giving him one last look over before falling upon his gloved hands- it didn&#39;t hurt to be safe

&quot;Your command seal, show it to me.&quot;

Regardless of whether he had one or not, his answer was sure to signal whether he was at least aware of the war or not. It wasn&#39;t like he&#39;d be alive enough to go babbling about him and Wilt if he wasn&#39;t, and a weak magus certainly did have his uses even in a place like this...who wouldn&#39;t trust a doctor after all.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; It was quickly added in after the prior command, giving a slight glance towards H.H, but it was in the same monotone that seemed to accent everything which Wilt said.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He’d give note to the immediate strangeness of the following inquiry, but would quickly realize he had little reason to think ill of it. Wilt’s voice held some similarity to his own, and he knew exactly what it meant: There was no emotion behind it, only the need for information.

A quick, deafened huff is all the sign the serial killer would give as to this disappointment before reaching a hand back into his open coat with his free hand.

“Wha- Damn you!”

The mage would struggle against the servant’s grasp, attempting to rip his arm from the ghastly Assassin’s hand or break free enough to angle his wrist so that he may stab him with his gladius… but the man in monochrome would prove too strong. Just as the serial killer has the strength to break himself out of any mundane shackles, so does he have the strength to overpower any normal human - this magus included.

He had been planning to do the same here, but his off-hand’s grip quickly switched from one torture tool to another as the man started to call out for his servant. While he would normally show no opposition to letting one’s partner observe their tortuous death given the fact that said partner was to die in a matter of mere moments as well, he knew that letting an opposing servant get close to the scene would make for an awfully uncertain and potentially dangerous situation.

In just as swift and mechanical an action as he’d shown when <em>dealing with</em> the other occupants of the hole-in-the-wall hotel they’d successfully annexed, HH swung a claw hammer straight into the back of the mage’s skull, an action punctuated by the metallic ring of the man’s sword dropping to the ground below. 

For Wilt and his murderous servant, the immediate outcome of the strike was obvious. The head of the hammer had sunk into the man’s cranial cavity, the force of the blow having caused the surrounding area of the skull to fracture and cave in. Satisfied with his handiwork, the serial killer would finally let go of the mage’s arm, allowing it to flop to his side.

Continuing his curiously learned method, HH would rip the hammer back out of the man’s head - which had quickly become the only thing supporting his upright position - causing chunks of gray matter, pieces of skull, and plenty of blood to initially be catapulted from the wound before slowly seeping out of it once the man’s body collapsed lifelessly to the floor, no longer supported by the hammer nor HH’s powerful grip.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fact that there was <em>another</em> magus in the alleyway would only come to him once the body of the mage that had dragged him in there dropped following that all so vicious blow from the terrifying monster his eyes had been locked onto the entire time.

The situation he’d found himself in was the worst. The absolute worst. He was tied to a corpse in an alleyway with the pair that killed the person that became said corpse. To make it even worse, the man that killed him was in no way, shape, nor form a “heroic spirit”. It wasn’t possible. He’d heard that all servants were meant to be notable figures from the past, and was assured that they were all heroes of ages long passed. But this… thing… There was no possible way that anyone from any era could ever have considered it a hero. It was a <em>monster</em>, plain and simple. 

The smell was awful. It felt as if he were being crushed under the pressure of even being near what he could only assume was some kind of bloodthirsty demon. A bloodthirsty demon… summoned by what looked to be a mere teenage boy?

“C-Command seal? Uh, I uh- What’s a…”

The doctor’s mind was so frazzled that it had taken him much too long to even remember what a command seal <em>was</em>. In a hurry, Florence would rip off both of his gloves, revealing nothing but his hands underneath.

“I-I don’t have one! I’m not a master, I swear-”

Florence would quickly cover his mouth. He hadn’t taken the time to realize that what he was about to say meant revealing that he knew <em>exactly</em> what was going on in Berenice.

Eyes bulging, pupils heavily dilated, and body shivering frantically, the doctor could only muster up a meek whisper in recognition of another mistake.

<em>“Oh no.”</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was not guilt about the murdering, what magus would be so soft stomached, but rather just a distaste for gore-one which would be rectified with any prolonged exposure to H.H. 

It was good that the Master was disposed of before he could bring his servant to their location, with whatever Mana the thing still had likely being sapped away as they spoke. He approached the body with the same slow pace, stopping only to pick up the gladius with his free hand. Wilt would weigh it back and forth, as though trying to get a feel for the blade, looking down at the bumbling doctor with the same blank look. He doubted the doctor would fight back in his current state, and running certainly wouldn&#39;t be an issue- being tied to a body like a prison would be to a weight.

Wilt would raise an eyebrow as he began to try and explain himself. He was a magus then, if not some bystander that was roped in by another Master or perhaps a member of the church- though with a second glance towards the doctor he kind of doubted it.

He&#39;d raise the gladius in the air, as though threatening the doctor, before bringing it down in an unsteady arc- he had never actually used a weapon such as this. With a sort of clang, the blade colliding with the ground, he severed the cord keeping him connected to the old Master. Though to say that it really freed him upon any level besides just not being chained to a dead body was a stretch. On one side of him was a murderous servant and on the other side of him was the Magus who summoned him. He lifted the blade up slowly, letting it simply scrape the ground, he didn&#39;t bother to raise it further.

&quot;I&#39;d think it&#39;d be wise to tell us what you know.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088265843730813029 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088265843730813029><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 22, 2023 7:59 PM">7:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The question was asked with this almost casual air to it, though the weapon resting in his hand seemed to tell an almost different story. Not that he needed more threatening than the serial killer less than a pace behind him, who is more than capable of handling it himself. 

&quot;Why are you here? Who are you with?&quot;

The intitial reason was obvious, trying to get in good with a decent family by offering his services in this war. Not many knew complex healing magics and servants were more than capable of inflicting very nasty blows from what he&#39;s observed of his own. Perhaps he could use that to his advantage, the doctor didn&#39;t seem to have too much of a spine. Lure an injured master into a hotel and have H.H deal with them. It&#39;d go off like clockwork.

The second potential reason was that he had pledged himself to another Master, an equally advantageous spot for Wilt to be in. Potentially being informed of a true name of another servant or even their location would be vital information if Wilt planned to win as he was. Though, who&#39;d let someone who couldn&#39;t even defend himself out in the streets alone- though he was picked up on for entirely different reasons if so.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was the only thing the doctor could tell himself. He had no means to defend himself, no servant to call upon to do battle for him, no allies waiting in the dark to rescue him. At this very moment, the doctor had nothing but his life - something he was so terrified of having taken from him that he was struggling to even breathe in the moment.

Who knows what may have happened if Florence had noticed the gladius drop next to him? What mattered much more, however, was that he had not.

Though his attention was largely focused on the murderous servant, the doctor would catch Wilt picking up the blade out of the corner of his eye. Purely on instinct, he would attempt to scramble backwards… only to find that his body refused to move. He would beg himself to move, screaming inwards at his brain and central nervous system, but would find no response.

Even as Wilt began a downwards arc with the sword in hand, the doctor couldn’t help but wonder why it is that his body deemed now the appropriate time to ignore his will. Time seemed to freeze for Florence, everything around him happening at a snail’s pace.

His initial thoughts were rather spastic and largely illegible, despite the fact that they were his own. <em>Focus.</em> You need to listen. Perhaps he’d simply given up, what with the circumstances surrounding the situation? No… that wasn’t in his nature. He was a surgeon, a doctor of medicine that defied the Mage’s Association in order to bring the miracle of his healing arts to the everyday man. But if it wasn’t a lack of willpower, then what was it? <em>Focus.</em>

The blade of the gladius continued to grow near to him, inching forward with every word that passed by in his head, but Florence gave little mind to it. He had to know why he was such a failure at this moment. He <em>had</em> to know, no matter what. If not that, then- But if that’s the case, how- Such a thing is possible, but rather unlikely… <em>Focus.</em> <em><strong>Focus.</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089405039698788462 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089405039698788462><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 25, 2023 11:26 PM">11:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The answer was evading him. At this point, the doctor had receded so far into his own head that even the overwhelming bloodlust polluting the alleyway had become little more than background noise to him. His body still refused to move, but the look on his face had shifted. Though his face was still contorted in fear, signs of confusion, or even intrigue had begun to appear. He was no longer looking at Wilt, but ponderously down at the ground. 

It was the very moment that the metallic ringing from the fallen magus’s blade impacting the wire the doctor was bound to sounded out that he reached a finalite answer. 

It all came back to that initial bout of worry he had during his flight to Aswan. The very idea that he could die - that he was mortal - was something he had not bothered to think about until then. Though he had worked with the wounded and dying almost every day for years of his life, the idea that he could become anything like those people sounded outrageous to him. He was a healer. He was a god of healing. What sort of god pondered their own mortality? And yet, here he was, the closest to the brink that he had ever come.

Seeing a man get killed in front of him bothered him very little. He’d watched men, women, and children pass on as he worked on saving them, and though he felt grief and anger at himself for being unable to do so, watching the life leave their eyes was something he felt strangely accustomed to, even if it wasn’t all that often that he saw it. What <strong>did</strong> bother him - rather understandably so - was the fact that he was next in line.  He was conditioned and prepared for the former, whereas the latter was so utterly alien to him that he couldn’t help but act as if he were a deer caught in a speeding vehicle’s headlights.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089405065204351017 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089405065204351017><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 25, 2023 11:26 PM">11:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then, Wilt would speak, an act not dissimilar to having reached directly into Florence’s mind and wrenching him out from it by the neck.

He would do his best to sit up, having found that being released from his bindings worked to lessen his stress, even if it was only by a miniscule amount.

“I, uh- um- sorry, uh- <em>sigh</em>. M-My name’s Dr. Florence Florenstine. I-I am a mage, b-but I’m nothing more than a mundane doctor, really.

Seeing Wilt start off by releasing the man was a point of contention in the serial killer’s mind. If he were attempting to make the “doctor” feel at ease, it was an alright way to do it… but there was no telling what the man would do in the following moments. As things turned out, the answer would be close to nothing, but the potential for disaster was there. 

Rather fortunately, on the other hand, this “Florence Florenstine” decided to answer his master’s questions in decent detail and with little sign that he was lying, but there was no way to tell if what he said was entirely, or even at all, truthful.

From what he could gather, Holmes was more than capable of simply removing the body- perhaps the target being a Magus was effecting that ability, or H.H simply wanted to screw with the doctor more. He wasn&#39;t going to bother asking, the answer seeming obvious

The young magus casually let the gladius hit the ground after it&#39;s use, it was a solid blade as far as the magus could tell but being in close quarters combat was already a poor situation and his lack of skill would only compound upon that, so he simply tossed it to the side. Where was he gonna hide the golden sword anyways?

Wilt seemed to pause at the mention of the church, having neglected to inform the church of his involvement. He was going to have to, naturally, eventually confirm his involement with the church- but it was hardly a priority in the eyes of the young man and going to the church with a murderer with him certainly would garter some negative attention especially if there is another Master also confirming their involement. The one thing which Wilt had going for him was the element of suprise, and whatever his servant was cooking up with the murder spree he was going on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090160924201066527 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090160924201066527><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 1:30 AM">1:30 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;I don&#39;t think it would be wise to travel there at night.&quot; He&#39;d tilt his head towards the fresh cadaver laying in the alley. &quot;The servant likely doesn&#39;t have much longer in it&#39;s lifespan, but it&#39;s far more dangerous to move around in the open. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of other masters prowling the night, people who will be far less kind than I.&quot;

His servant was more than capable of giving them the slip, but the doctor well enough wouldn&#39;t be able to call his bluff, he hoped. Relying on the fear of the doctor seemed like a more than apt strategy to the inexperienced magus, especially with how

&quot;There is a place which we can more easily defend, for the night at least. I insist.&quot;

Wilt forced a sort of smile, revealed to be fake under any sort of scrutiny, though whether it was out of malice or simple inexperience when it came to lying was up to the doctor to divine.

The appeal of having a medic close by was certainly appealing, especially one which he could easily coerce into assisting him be it through force or simply fear- though having an operation done by someone who disliked you was not ideal. Having a proficent magus in and of itself was a massive boon to the duo, even if he, as he said, couldn&#39;t do much besides healing magecraft. He probably wouldn&#39;t be much of an asset even if he would fight for them anyways, being just as inexperienced in combat as the master.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not a new revelation, exactly, yet the serial killer had been hoping his master had <em>some</em> sort of guise when it came to this sort of thing, only to find that his poker face was, indeed, his only face. His words were wisely chosen, at the very least.

After sighing as quietly as possible, the serial killer would refocus his thoughts on the man in front of them.

It wasn’t that he didn’t trust his master; nevertheless, he wanted to make sure this man would come with them with as little added hostility as possible. With a deep breath and slow exhale, his ghastly form would once again be covered by his true-yet-false identity, a mask that made a mockery of the living. In doing so, the alleyway would be alleviated of the slaughterhouse-like malodor that came with his true form. The doctor had already seen him, meaning his presence as a servant would not fade from the man’s mind, but the costume would take on anyway.

Now lacking that ungodly malicious aura and appearing much more human, HH would take a few steps towards the doctor, going around his master.

“In spite of what you witnessed, the man you see standing in front of you is not all that much of a monster. An honest and simple businessman that was forced into a bad position is all I was in life. Please, call me Pratt.”

With that, the serial killer - having disguised any and all malicious intentions that could be inferred from his appearance alone - would reach a hand down to the doctor with the slightest of smiles on his face. 

“My master is rather correct, unfortunately. If we were to leave you here or vice-versa, it would be impossible to tell whether or not you’d run into another party such as ours. One can imagine others scouting the area nearby the Church, and I happen to be little more than a proficient assassin when it comes to combat, whereas our meek and humble hideout has been thoroughly checked for traps and unwanted surveillance. We have a number of rooms ready, should you find yourself interested. Free of charge, of course.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The gladius hit the ground next to him, giving him some reassurance that the pair in front of him weren’t there to murder him… yet, at least. He’d look Wilt right in the eye as he spoke to him, wanting to give the magus with an upper hand on him little reason to think he was going to do anything he didn’t want him to do. 

That being said, the words that came out of the man’s mouth weren’t exactly wrong, and for many reasons: The night was when servants and their masters prowled around for enemies to slaughter, not the mention the servant of the mage they killed wasn’t likely to be gone quite yet, and they would assuredly presume that <em>he</em> was the one that did their master in. Though he wasn’t a participant in the war per se, he knew that much.

“I guess you’re right… I mean, it wouldn’t be impossible to get me a cab or just take me to my hotel, would it…?”

The reasoning was there… but something still felt off. More than likely, that feeling had to do with the otherworldly murderer standing behind Wilt - not to mention the young mage’s poor attempt at a grin - but there was something else to it. A gut feeling the doctor couldn’t quite shake, even knowing that there was no other option.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090850232096526466 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090850232096526466><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 29, 2023 11:09 PM">11:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then, to his surprise, the next breath in was like that of a sandy beach’s breeze. The sudden surge of freshness would cause the mage to stop staring at the man in front of him, allowing him to notice his servant sneaking around him. Or, at least, what <em>was</em> his servant. The pale, ghostly figure of that same servant from before had become more… human… though he couldn’t get a good grasp of what he looked like, something he blamed on the moon’s dim light.

He didn’t remember if the servant had spoken to him as of yet or not, but his voice remained familiar all the same. 

“P-Pratt? Gotcha…”

The doctor would look down and away from the servant as they spoke, only to be startled once again when the servant’s hand came towards him out of his peripheral vision. Thankfully the servant appeared to be rather patient, keeping his hand extended out for the doctor to take as he continued speaking, reinforcing his master’s words with every sentence he spoke.

“Free of charge…? Is it a motel or something? I, uh, I- Okay, you got me beat. Just don’t kill anyone else in front of me, alright? As a doctor, I’d prefer to see as little of the violence as possible, especially if there’s nothing I can do to save them.”

After a moment of quiet consideration and the gathering of composure, the doctor would grasp “Pratt’s” hand. The moment he did, he would be yanked up to his feet, almost as if Pratt put as much effort into pulling him up as he did taking a step. The action forced a yelp out of him, but he would succeed at stabilizing himself enough to continue standing. Though, If a supposedly weak servant was this strong, what could a Saber or Berserker do? He’d have shuddered at the thought if he hadn’t already done his fair share of shuddering tonight.

“Don’t expect me to fight, either. Or help, even. I don’t want to be on anyone’s bad side, y’know? I’m just here for the civilians…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thank you, Mr. Hossfeld.”

<em>Let’s see. Hossfeld… hmm… had he ever heard of a Hossfeld family before?</em> The doctor tried his best to keep a happy face on while he gathered his thoughts and considered what they meant. 

This “William” fellow was a rather grim sort, though he knew very well that most mages tended to have a somewhat similar personality, though this one seemed a bit… off, even for a mage. Calling the doctor weak and giving him advice was quite the blunt way of going about things, especially for someone who’s meant to be incredibly secretive about the goings on here. Perhaps they truly did consider him some sort of ally… or a resource, at best. Most war efforts were in vain without the necessary medical advice and practice, as far as the doctor was aware, and he was one of the best surgeons and healers in the United States, if not the world at large.

That being said, he knew better than to give any special treatment to these two. Or any treatment at all, for that matter. Mages aren’t the type to give leniency to the ally of an enemy, even one that has little or nothing to do with the conflict.

The doctor, having quickly steeled his mind as any good medical professional should have the ability to do, would make his way closer to the mage that saved him, making sure to keep a professional amount (6 ft./2 m) of distance from him. His facial expression was largely devoid of features that would reveal his inner thoughts, though a small fire or the sheen of ice could be seen in his eyes if one were to look close enough.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092309261066964992 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092309261066964992><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 11:47 PM">11:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“One thing, before we go.

Though it wasn’t a lie, what the doctor spoke was something that he hadn’t decided up until the moment he was saved from execution. He was weak, and that he’d come to know all too well in a matter of moments. 

He didn’t come here to die, but… he wasn’t quite sure why he did, really. It wasn’t like he was going to save more people here than he would’ve during a lifetime at home.

HH would stand there quietly as the two mages in his presence went about their conversation and few other goings on, making sure to keep an eye and an ear out for any potential danger as he casually observed.

In a somewhat ironic twist, his master- who had been questioning the purpose of his alias, unbeknownst to him- decided to take an alias himself, one that HH would take to mind in the case that it was ever needed. Though he cared little to explain himself, the serial killer made note of every little thing he possibly could about the doctor, from his clothing to his hygiene to his personality to his voice and accent… the latter of which being the reason he decided to take an alias. It became quickly obvious to HH that the man was American, which was the worst case scenario in terms of one learning his True Name.

When Florence began his approach towards Wilt, the serial killer would swiftly reach under his coat and grip a weapon from his “belt”, but would be just as quick to release it once he began his little speech.

HH would remain quiet, but his mind would not. The man had been so scared of dying one second, then decided he was just fine with dying the next? It wasn’t exactly abnormal to make a declaration such as that following a threat or non-life threatening punishment, but stating such a thing after nearly taking a blade to the throat… there were too many potential reasons as to why one would do so to come to an early conclusion, but it was something to keep an eye on, surely.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092309377328889908 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092309377328889908><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 11:47 PM">11:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In any case, the serial killer would turn to the pair, only to bow in response to his master’s inquiry.

“I believe there is a matter I must deal with before joining you, Master William, but I will be sure to keep close once I am done. It will only be a matter of seconds, I assure you.”

The mage’s body had yet to stop gushing blood from the horrendous head wound HH had inflicted, despite his weapon of choice for him having been a mere claw hammer. Had he put all of his strength into the swing, he was almost certain there’d be no head to bleed from… but that wasn’t the point. He needed his Noble Phantasm present in order to rid the world of the dead man once and for all, and had decided it would be best to keep his favorite tools secret from the doctor for the time being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To someone like Wilt, the idea of simply accepting his death seemed almost comical, delirium induced statements....or perhaps a sign of defiance from the doctor? He quickly discarded the idea, although they didn&#39;t really have any sort of allegiance to Wilt and his servant he didn&#39;t seem like the type of person to take such a brave stance, doubly so with his servant well within striking distance. Throwing away one&#39;s life for another seemed to him like the product of an equally ill state of mind, Wilt being wholly unable to wrap his head around the idea of such an alien concept. He tilted his head to the side, as though pantamiming interest that laid far dormant.

&quot;Is that so?&quot;

His attention quickly seemed to dart elsewhere, it was unlikely that&#39;d he get much out of the magus in terms of recuperating his wounds- not that he planned to take many to begin with. Servants didn&#39;t exactly need proper medical care, and had Wilt taken a wound that surpassed the effectiveness of basic bandaging he was likely already gone. The doctor still had his uses anyways, even with his unwillingness to heal him-or others. Using him like a red herring would certainly bear it&#39;s fruit, even if he got away.

His servant sending them away more than enough to signal what he had intended to do. Disposing of the body brought them ever closer to their win condition- something which would hopefully bridge the gap in raw power between H.H and the other servants with all the bodies being consumed as noble sacrifices to the re-enactment of his history- or perhaps giving form to his myth. Wilt couldn&#39;t be sure at this state, but neither really mattered to the young mage. The acquistion of mana would take the strain off of his own pitiful reserves ever so slowly.


&quot;Follow me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092684129621000242 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092684129621000242><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 12:36 AM">12:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He&#39;d kind of just gesture to the doctor, beckoning him to approach as he slowly slinked out of the alleyway, respecting the distance set up by Florence though he didn&#39;t let his presence evade him.

It didn&#39;t matter, Wilt wouldn&#39;t let this opporunity pass him by for any sort of advantage in this game with so many odds against him. Although his stance was almost casual, one of his hands preoccupied with that same cup from prior, he kept his other hand free now- taking the occasional glance at the residual sand which rested around them as though planning for him to run. Almost akin to a hunter waiting for his prey to show an opening....or a hunting dog waiting for the bird to be let out of it&#39;s cage.

As though in response to his break from his servant, a familar sort of whispering voice seemed to infect his thoughts-even if just for a moment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092684147983663155 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092684147983663155><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 12:36 AM">12:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>&quot;My, my, aren&#39;t you just awful.

Now wasn&#39;t the time to get flustered, or even retort to the spirit. He just needed to march to their end goal, he could deal with the spirit later. The spirit would almost sigh in response to his silence. *&quot;You call him weak, yet here you are relying on that foul spirit. And you dare to think of me as something that needs to be purged.&quot; A sort of dry laughter infected his brain as the spirit continued.

He decided to follow the same path that his servant had went, a sort of tried and true route. It was unlikely for a Master or a Servant to get the jump on an Assasin class servant, especially one as meticiolous as his own, so his trust in the stability of the route was very ardent and the need to avoid groups was especially noted- Florence perhaps even being able to call to them for help</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For what purpose the doctor shouted, even he didn’t know. In this moment, he was little more than a confused, lost man in a dangerous, foreign place. 

He’d focus on what he was most familiar with for the time being, that being himself and the two he had unintentionally found solace with… or so he hoped.

Florence turned his head to face the servant when he spoke, and - though he wished to - he knew better than to question Pratt leaving himself behind. There was a body to deal with, for one, and it wasn’t like Berenice didn’t have some sort of police force, so he decided to leave any thoughts about it at that.

Though Wilt may have anticipated the doctor running, he had little reason to so. He’d watched them kill a man in cold blood, and he was rather suspicious of them given what he’d seen of HH, but, at the same time, they’d offered him armed escort to a secure spot, something someone as weak and frightened as he was in that moment desperately sought. Instead, Florence would trail Wilt with as much gusto as he could muster in order to keep pace with the mage, completely unaware of what sort of fate awaited him at their destination.

The doctor would remain largely quiet during their walk, having become at least somewhat aware of “William’s” aversion to conversation. That being said, he was doing his best to keep an eye on the mage, making sure he wasn’t going to suddenly slip away and lead him on his own, or worse. 

Having observed the mage suddenly tense up, Florence would shift his stance, ready to run, only to see the tension leaving Wilt’s body just as fast as it came. The doctor would sigh, then mutter something to himself about how he’d seen and treated all kinds of people before continuing on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092904982149345340 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092904982149345340><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 3:14 PM">3:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Like a silent death march through the night, Wilt and Florence would make their way to the dingy hotel in which Wilt’s serial killer servant was summoned without further incident.

In fact, the certain lack of said serial killer in their vicinity would begin to weigh on his mind despite the brevity of their trek.

After a moment, Florence would sit up slowly, rubbing his back and the back of his head as best he could.

“Ow… Why would you do that…?” 

Once he came to open his eyes, the doctor would notice the sudden change of scenery. This place really <em>was</em> a hotel, if a somewhat “economical” one. He’d take a second to look around before getting up, realizing with a start what he had done.

“God d- Sorry about that, guys. I can probably pay for a replacement, if you-”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The other doctor would interrupt the worried Florence with as much grace and politeness as possible.

“If it fell to the mere body weight of a man such as yourself, I cannot think but to imagine what a servant such as myself could do to it. I am fairly certain we have the resources to repair it, if need be. It’s nothing to worry about.”

The building would look somewhat strange without a door, certainly, but did it not already look rather derelict? That, and… a building without a door was sure to invite thieves, squatters, and other derelicts. Most would figure that mages tended to prefer not to have such people intrude upon their workshops, but in this case, the serial killer was happy to invite them into Wilt’s.

“For the time being, it would be best for you to get some rest. That mission of yours surely requires you to be well rested and in the best shape possible. The same goes for you, master. Tomorrow is certain to be a long day for us. For all of us.”</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 3:18 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Punctual as ever, Pratt.&quot;

He reached a hand out as the doctor fell forward, certainly not assisting the doctor and it winced back a bit as he hit the ground. Lacking a door wasn&#39;t...bad, but it certainly didn&#39;t invoke confidence in the place that Wilt had chose- a servant could probably tear through this place like paper, but that was the risk you paid when you tried out a very in the open spot to make his workshop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093404244943573083 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093404244943573083><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 12:18 AM">12:18 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Wilt would make his way behind the counter, simply waving off Florenstines concerns with the flick of his wrist. There was an assortment of empty room keys vaguely organized. He halted for a moment, as the vague phantasm of the person who decided to play solitaire popped back into his mind, but with a slight shake of his head he pulled out and tossed lazily towards the Doctor. It was one fairly close to his own, easier work for his servant in case he attempted to make his escape-which he was slowly starting to doubt as a possibility not without them breaching this man&#39;s boundaries  in some way.

&quot;I should be able to fix it in the morning.&quot; He likely could just attempt to jerry rig a solution, to hold the door on the handle for appearance sake-not that thieves wouldn&#39;t be appreciated.

Wilt would toss the small paper cup that had been accompanying him till now in the trash. Watching the remains of the now cold liquid simply spill and mix with the various paper work that had been tossed-likely to avoid having to file it later.

&quot;I think that would be best.&quot; He walked back out from behind the desk, giving a sort of glance over towards the now silenced fan-the cold night rendering them useless till daybreak.

&quot;Goodnight, Dr Florenstine.&quot; He was happy enough to get rest, though the drain on his mana was hardly as bad as it initially had been, it still took a physical toll upon the master- akin to overworking a muscle not that it wasn&#39;t anything that couldn&#39;t be fixed by some good rest and a hot cup in the morning. &quot;Please do sleep well, as Assasin said, we have a long day tomorrow.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But given that it very much <em>is</em> a hotel, one that does not seem abandoned in the slightest, apart from being somewhat cheap-looking… why did some foreign mage seem to claim some sort of ownership over it?

Not wanting to risk finding himself unnerved once more, Florence would close his eyes for a moment in order to steel his nerves, doing his best to shift his focus away from any such thoughts. 

Unfortunately, being jumpscared by Assassin led to the only other thought he had at the moment being a reliving of the largely one-sided slaughter of a… a, uh… who was it again?

“I see…”

That was as much a response as the doctor could give as he repeated his mental self-questioning again and again. <em>He was attacked. He was nearly killed. Pratt killed his attacker, right in front of him.</em> He knew all of that. He remembered all of that. But then… why couldn’t he remember his attacker’s face? Their size, gender, voice, body shape, why he was attacked in the first place?

Having a key impact against his quest would snap him back to reality, and he would dexterously snatch from the air before letting it drop to the ground. In that same moment, Assassin’s mention of rest would allow Florence to realize how truly tired this experience had made him, both physically and mentally, causing him to ignore the veiled threat of a “long day”, and temporarily erasing the curiosity he had regarding the identity of the man he saw get killed. 

“I’ll- <em>yawn</em>- have to agree on that one. Goodnight, Mr. Hossfeld, Assassin.”

With that, the doctor would make his way upstairs…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Goodnight, Dr. Florenstine.”

That would be all he spoke the rest of the night… physically. Just as the doctor’s figure faded from their view, the serial killer would dematerialize into spirit form, taking even further strain off of his master’s delicate magic circuits.

<em>”Before you find yourself comfortable and locked in that near-death state the living like to call sleep, Master Wilt, I would like to converse with you, if only for a moment.”</em>

Just as other servants did, the two of them shared a mental link. In the serial killer’s case, however, using it while uncloaked would lead to an incredibly uncomfortable experience for his master, leading him to using it only when he found it necessary.

<em>“In addition to that master, I ended up… harvesting… a small number of street urchins, along with a solitary shop owner I was afraid had seen what occurred in the alleyway. Their disappearance is likely to be noticed, unfortunately, but there should be little to worry about on our end.”</em>

A short pause would open Wilt’s ears to nothing but silence and the sounds of a rickety old building.

<em>”I have to ask, irregardless: How is it you wish to keep o’ doctor-of-ours in our grasp? Not that you have yet to notice, but the man seems a rather fickle sort… I have my doubts that he would make an escape attempt whilst in our proximity, though such a thing would require our presence on a constant basis, and acting as a man’s ball-and-chain seems a poor way to win a war.”</em>

The serial killer had plenty of things in mind himself… but he wanted to hear directly what it was his master was thinking before taking any action that could be considered rash or otherwise act to insult Wilt. Not that he was one to care about the feelings of others, but he considered such an inquiry and an equally open response in return appropriate of their relationship as partners in crime.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The servant&#39;s master would wait for the doctor to leave, letting H.H go ahead and ask his question- not bothering to respond as he marked an unspoken agreement with the servant. Wilt was ponder over the question for a few moments, ignoring his servant&#39;s strange way of describing sleep. He had obviously planned to make use of the doctor&#39;s presence, but the exact details had almost evaded the young mage.

<em>&quot;If we plan to use him, having him willingly do so would be the best. He has a desire to help. Seemingly self sacrificing.&quot;</em>

He didn&#39;t enjoy talking in his own head, but he was more than used to it, his ring more than happy to throw it&#39;s two cents in at any moment. 

*&quot;We could him use this hotel as his clinic. Despite what he said earlier, I don&#39;t think he ever planned to hunker down within the church. Wandering around in the dead of night, and he has his own place to stay at, no? I think he is bolder than we give him credit for, or perhaps simply more fool hardy.&quot;

Wilt would take a few steps towards the stairwell.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094176637425295412 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094176637425295412><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 8, 2023 3:27 AM">3:27 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>&quot;Some doctor working out of a hotel to help people hurt during the war is suspicious enough.

Although medical magecraft was certainly a great boon, attempting to use it on civilians was fairly difficult unless you were wholly devoted to the guise of being some medical proffesional (or were one of course), meaning the Florence already needed a level of discretion to each of his actions or so Wilt deduced.

<em>&quot;More people coming in means there are more for us to harvest at any rate- as well as valuable information. If they were injured because of the actions of a servant-it could help us surmise what their abilities are or even their True Name. I doubt he feels the need to remember every injured patient who comes through here.&quot;</em> It was a stretch, of course, but in a game like this even the slightest upperhand being even a inch ahead could be the difference between life and death.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;d be happy to hear what you have to say on the matter, I&#39;m hardly an expert on the matter.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though the serial killer was quite fond of his own ideas, his meager master had a head on him much unlike partners of times past. He found himself put somewhat at ease at the suggestion of letting Florence do the ball-and-chaining himself, for there was work to be done elsewhere. With that and the fact that one has to be wary of such a master’s endurance in mind, it was time to put an end to this long day.

<em>“I find myself impressed, Master Wilt. On that note, there is little need for me to speak my mind. Should he awake before you, I will make it clear to the doctor that our humble abode is free for him to use as he sees fit. If not, it would be best that you make such a declaration, given my apparent penchant for frightening the poor man. For the meantime, I shall do my best to prepare a makeshift infirmary. Let us call each other partners in… hospitality.”</em>

A quiet and spectral sound could be heard. Was that a chuckle?

<em>”At the risk of repeating myself- Goodnight, Master Wilt.”</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, April 9, 2023 2:13 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
