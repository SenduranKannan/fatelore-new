Aswan, Egypt, Late Afternoon</code>
The ferry wasn&#39;t terribly fast, chugging along the Nile with a slightly worrisome creaking, but it did offer its passengers a unique opportunity to take in the views. Andreas, for the most part, convinced himself that he was indeed enjoying the sights. It was better than focusing his attention on the overcrowded ferry, at any rate.

When they finally touched down on solid ground again, the sun was just starting to set. A small breeze had picked up as well with the changing of the daylight, hitting their faces with a refreshing coolness that offered some welcoming relief from the heat of the day. Berenice was only an island, a few kilometers long and just over a single kilometer wide. It didn&#39;t take them long to locate Berenice Church, as it was the only church on the island, and so everyone more or less knows where it was.

The walk there took the Church pair across the bustling downtown area. They strolled past shops and restaurants, filled their five senses with a feast of sounds, smells, and spectacles - tourist traps included - and learned the hard way about keeping a close eye on their possessions. It seemed that pickpockets were rampant, even in Egypt!

But all in all, the final stretch of their journey was relatively painless, and could even qualify as &#39;pleasant&#39; again. The novelty of witnessing a different culture was stimulating to the mind, and both men arrived at the church in good spirits.

As they approached the building, a sign at the front door drew their attention:

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">⚠️ HEADS UP ⚠️

We are renovating the Berenice Church to make it a more enjoyable experience for you. See you again next year. Thank you for your patience!</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perfect to endure the Egyptian weather.

It looked old, but far from decrepit. He archived that information as well.

&quot;I see that Sister Rosula has taken initiative.&quot; Gabriele said. &quot;Or was it you, brother, who suggested her to close the church? Either way, a wise move.&quot; He turned to Andreas, believing that the sign had been pre-planned.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was just one issue, however.

&#39;How can we let all the participants know that the church is, in fact, open to them? It&#39;s hard enough to keep track of the ones who do bother to report to us, never mind the stragglers.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unfortunately, all the windows were covered by blackout curtains, designed to keep the hot sun away.

He immediately knocked and awaited a response.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still no one came to the door.

A sandy aroma invaded the two&#39;s nostrils, followed by a windy draft that had been trapped by the door&#39;s tightness. The floor was covered in carpet, red and white, which matched the darker hues of the brown pews. Nothing was spotless, but it wasn&#39;t weathered either. It looked like a normal church, albeit one that hadn&#39;t received many visitors recently. No prints on the floor, nor any shade on the benches. Sister Rosula&#39;s warning had done a great job at dissuading anyone from entering.

But Gabriele knew better. He marched forward, towards the holy altar where the service would normally occur. There was no one there of course, save for traces of candles and a small, silver plate. A glass stained window let in some rays of sunlight from the outside, being the only one not covered by blackout curtains. A statue of Christ dangled from above, illuminated by its radiance.

Compelled by such a display, Gabriele instinctively raised his arm and blessed his left and right sides in a cross shape fashion before turning back to Andreas.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A ray of light illuminated the path to a right corner. He followed it, emerging into the familiar sight of a tidy garden. It was looked after, with everything from fruits, flowers and vegetables, showing signs of care and attention. The fresh aroma of manure was impressed on Gabriele&#39;s nose, no doubt being used as a fertilizer for the voracious plants. He took more steps, swinging his head side by side as he inspected the results of Sister Rosula&#39;s gardening.

It was subtle, but he noticed the human touch. The small curves in the terrain that could have only been caused by the pressure of a human&#39;s finger tips. One with calloused and sturdy fingers. His mind was already sketching out an image of Rosula&#39;s physique and characteristics, storing it into a secluded folder inside of his circuits and then archiving it. He blinked and turned back to Andreas.

&quot;A very impressive job. Our brothers back in Rome could learn from these irrigation techniques.&quot; He pointed to the slightly wet terrain. Clearly it hadn&#39;t been long since the crops had been watered.

The voice took both men by surprise. A melodious voice that sounded like it was coming from somewhere afar, but also incredibly close, as if it had been whispered in their ears. A wheelchair had been laid out amidst a bed of flowers near the center of the garden, and a child wrapped in laundered white robes perched on it, holding a casket of apples on their lap. 

Now that their attention had been drawn to it, the child was impossible to miss. What was curious was the fact that neither of them had taken notice until the child had decided to speak up. It almost felt as if a charm had been broken, and the fabric of peace was startled like pebbles skidding across a tranquil lake.

Sensing their eyes, the child turned to face the men, and they saw their own reflections staring back at them through a shining, black visor. The child was wearing an oversized <strong>helmet</strong>, the kind that you&#39;d get from a gift shop at a science museum that made them roleplay their favorite astronauts. Or maybe it was simply a hand-me-down from a retired member of a local biker gang.

&#39;Would you like an apple?&#39;

The child held up their hands and presented an apple that had been bitten in, with perfectly straight teeth marks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slowly. He had heard plenty of stories during his stay at the abbey: His brothers seeing signs of God. Visions of angels. Sensations that woke them up at night, followed by the smell of sulfur or the laughter of cherubs. Such signs could easily be pointed to hallucinations, misdirection, overactive imagination or even childish pranks. He had never once doubted the existence of God, but he wasn&#39;t a man who believed in miracles.

But the child in front of him exuded a supernatural aura. He was sure that he had observed the plants around the boy before. He took records of them in his circuits. Yet he had only noticed the plant, taking no notice of the kid&#39;s ridiculous appearance.

A spell? A charm?

&quot;You seem to have chosen it already.&quot; Gabriele replied, pointing to the bitten portion of the apple. &quot;It is rude to pick something and then discard it. Please finish your own apple.&quot;

It was idle small talk, but small talk was all that Gabriele needed to buy time. He scanned the boy for any signs of foul play. Anything that popped out, he engraved in his circuits. Height, apperance, voice, injuries. They appeared weak, and must have been if they were confined to such a state, but he could not discern further unless he took a closer look.

&quot;Since you seem to know who Sister Rosula is, do you mind telling us where she is? My brother and I have important business with her.&quot; Gabriele asked with a light, polite bow. To tell the truth, he would rather ask who the boy was in the first place, but his current objective was to find Rosula. It would be unbecoming of an executor to do anything but that.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Thank you, Gabriele.&#39; The child brought the apple to their own face and took another bite. To be more precise, they brought the apple under their helmet, under which it disappeared. For a few seconds, all that could be heard was the sound of chewing.

<em>munch munch</em> 
<em>munch munch</em>

Eventually, the chewing stopped. The helmet bobbed, indicating that the child had swallowed one last mouthful of their late afternoon snack. Gabriele waited, but couldn&#39;t see any sign of the apple&#39;s core or stem. The child had eaten the portions that people normally would discard as well. 

&#39;Aah~&#39; The child burped, wiping the front of their helmet with the back of their hands as if they were wiping their mouth. Immediately, Gabriele&#39;s circuits had latched onto new data: underneath the pure white robes, the skin of the child&#39;s arm was chipped and cracked, leaking a black, soot-like substance into the air. 

&#39;Sister Rosula is out shopping for dinner, for I reminded her that she will be cooking for <em>four</em> tonight.&#39; The child replied openly, holding up an index finger and a middle finger on both hands, adding up to a total of four digits. &#39;Did you not notice the lack of keys hanging on the hook by the main office door? The pile of baskets at the entrance of the kitchen is also slightly askew, as she left in a hurry when she took the topmost basket.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had seen people starving in Africa, but even they wouldn&#39;t have seen a stem as a piece of sustenance.

&quot;I see.&quot; The executor finally spoke, not even flinching at the fact that the child seemed to know his name. &quot;I apologise, I didn&#39;t pay attention. It is my first time visiting the Berenice Church.&quot; Gabriele nodded.

<strong>&quot;You aren&#39;t human, are you?&quot;</strong> He then asked. &quot;You seem damaged, but not in the same way that a human is. I can&#39;t smell the scent of blood, nor do I sense any desperation that normally comes from being mortally wounded.&quot;

He turned to Andreas, motioning for him to be wary. The executor then reached for his pockets, where one would normally keep their Black Keys. The situation was escalating.

&quot;But will you be a problem?&quot; He asked out of the blue. &quot;I see no point in exerting violence over someone who means me no harm. What is your purpose here? How do you know about Sister Rosula? <strong>Who are you?&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They prodded the base of their helmet with a bony finger and started swinging their feet, much like a child deep in thought. &#39;I wanted to see your reaction in person. It&#39;s way more exciting to experience what it&#39;s like to be threatened by those Black Keys than imagining it myself. Just as I thought. It&#39;s fun!&#39;

They pointed to Gabriele&#39;s pocket, where he stored the conceptual weapons.

&#39;Don&#39;t worry. We are on the same page.

It wasn&#39;t that he wanted to enjoy the views of the garden more than the conversation, since he didn&#39;t have a green thumb and couldn&#39;t appreciate Rosula&#39;s efforts as much as Gabriele had. He had hung back, for the sudden appearance of the child had surprised him as much as it did Gabriele. But unlike Gabriele, he didn&#39;t have the means to defend himself should the child turn out to be a hostility.

For someone who completely lacked any means of offense, any lapse in judgement could be fatal. The child hadn&#39;t just teleported into their vision; from the indents the wheelchair had imprinted on the soil to the sap-stained fringes of their robes, all signs of evidence suggested that they had been sitting in the sun for a while. It was him and Gabriele who had failed to take notice of them until they had decided to speak up.

At best, it could be some sort of illusory magecraft at work. At worst, it pointed to mental pollution, meaning that he and Gabriele had already fallen victim to an attack. Which made it all the more dangerous to <em>speak</em> to the child, but...

&#39;A Servant?&#39; He couldn&#39;t help himself. &#39;Ruler?&#39;

An <strong>impartial third party</strong> to ensure the smooth operation of the grand ritual called the Holy Grail War. The notion sounded absurd, as though Ruler-class Servants had been documented in several Grail Wars of the past, their appearances had been extremely <em>rare</em>. The only times the Grail had called forth a Servant of an aberrant Class was during a state of emergency. Under the most dire of circumstances.

...Which the Berenice Grail War fell into. If only barely.

A large-scale Grail War <em>could</em> be classified as an outlier. That was true. Andreas <em>could</em> check that box, if he wanted, but...

The child stopped swinging their legs, but their posture remained completely relaxed, as if knowing that neither Executor nor Priest would harm them now that they had come clean. &#39;If I make up a lie on this, you&#39;ll see through it right away, Mr. Priest-In-Name-Only. But if I tell you the truth, then someone will intercept this message, and my own life will be in danger.&#39;

They flapped their unnaturally thin arms, dispersing even more black particles into the air. 

&#39;As you can see, I am weak, and hurt. Though I have the power to see through lies, I cannot defend myself with honesty.

Of all things that Gabriele had expected when tasked on a mission to Egypt, he had not expected to meet with a Ruler Class Servant. The probability of him encountering one in his lifetime was far too small to happen, so he had never planned for this occurrence.

He was always good at improvising.

&quot;I see.&quot; Unlike Andreas, Gabriele remained composed. An executor was excellent at managing their emotions, even if a corner in the priest&#39;s mind was whispering to end the Servant there. Perhaps due to that, he couldn&#39;t help but take out his Black Keys and flash them at the boy.

&quot;They aren&#39;t as fun as you would think. By the time they appear, my task has usually been completed.&quot; Gabriele said, letting the Servant take a good look. It was a friendly gesture, but also a threat.

Brother Andreas joined in, stating the impossibility of Ruler&#39;s presence. Gabriele agreed with him, then witnessed the child dodging his brother&#39;s demands and begging for a civil conversation.

He had never been a fan of Servants. In general, he disliked strong personalities, since being humble was part of his teachings. Plus, Servants usually had trickery at their disposal that made it hard to understand their goals. In this case, the child knew a lot more than Gabriele thought they did. Some sort of hyperawareness. Clairvoyance, was it? He heard that was a skill that Servants had access to, but he was unaware that Rulers could use it too. Maybe it could have been something more divine like-

He did not finish that thought.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The child leaned in conspiratorially and pretended to whisper in a voice that was just loud enough to be heard by both Gabriele and Andreas. 

&#39;They will begin to question the judge&#39;s motives. In extreme cases, they&#39;ll even start to distort the judge&#39;s intentions and accuse them of acting out of personal interest. Perhaps, even resort to violent means...&#39;

The child huddled their own body, as if trying to shield themselves from some invisible sources of harm. Could it be, that the injuries on their body...?

&#39;Well, there is no single prayer that is universally accepted. But everyone still prays.&#39; The child said matter-of-factly. &#39;I can still be a good Ruler, with or without a single name to describe myself. But speaking of names, do you have one for me?

&quot;...Joshua.&quot; He awkwardly broke the silence. &quot;I have been named after angels myself, so it would be rude of me to not do the same for a lost soul. If your motives and origins are true, then that can be the only name that fits you.&quot;

Gabriele said with his calm, composed tone. It was the best way to hide how he truly felt inside: That the Servant in front of them resembled a snake more than the Lord Almighty. However, he was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, for now. A Grail War without its Ruler sounded disastrous.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Will there?&quot;

It was a simple reply, but one that held a lot of weight. Gabriele did not believe in miracles, despite his creed. Any strange occurrence could be logically explained. Any statistical improbability was simply the exception to the rule. One could believe in God and still believe that the world was governed by physics and logic.

But this Servant seemed to know more. Clairvoyance or not, their knowledge was boundless. Like Jesus warning his apostles before the last supper. A prediction intended to save them from needless mourning, only for the opposite to occur. Miracles were not always good. Sometimes they were bad. Bad omens that led those around them to suffer and despair.

&quot;What business is it of yours, what I hope for?&quot; The executor&#39;s tone was slow, pronounced. A quiet filled the garden as all that was left was the chirping of birds and buzzing of bees.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I&#39;m no good with playing.

If you&#39;d like, I can even give you some private lessons on Calculus and the like. You&#39;ll find my teaching to be much more palatable than those textbooks you&#39;ve brought.&#39;

Even as Gabriele turned away, the child Servant&#39;s voice intruded his ears, imprinting themselves on his mind. Now that he had been made aware of their existence, it seemed almost impossible to exclude them from his consciousness anymore. Only after he had completely withdrawn from the vicinity of the garden and shut himself inside the church, did peace return to his mind...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gabriele wanted to hide away, feeling like he had just been put under a microscope by a beings above him, like a child toying with ants under a magnifying glass. And just like a summer ant, he was burning.

&quot;A child. A Ruler. A Servant that does not wish for the Grail.&quot; He repeated to himself, taking a seat on a pew as he stared at the holy altar ahead. The statue of Christ looked slightly darker.

His circuits were aflame, processing all the information he had gathered from the encounter and running various theories across. Gabriele did not believe in miracles, only logical deductions. By using his circuits and the information contained within him, he could make estimates of future actions through assumptions, likelihood and probability.

But what that Servant did, it went beyond deduction. It was like predestination. Future omens. A true miracle.

It scared him. The concept of a miracle. Something like that could only be spawned by God.

&quot;Calm down. Focus. They are simply a Ruler. Break them down into parts.&quot; He extended his arm forward, reaching for the Christ statue despite being currently seated.

&quot;They are a Heroic Spirit,&quot;

&quot;summoned by the Grail,&quot;

&quot;weak and frail,&quot;

&quot;therefore, not an issue,&quot;

<strong>&quot;not yet.&quot;</strong>

He let his elbows rest on his knees and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his breathing had stabilized and his stress levels had reset. It was a habit he had adopted since he was a baby: To break things down into parts. It calmed him down and offered solutions in an instant.

&quot;In the name of the Lord, the Berenice Grail War shall proceed smoothly. That is all that is required of me.&quot; Gabriele declared, staring at the statue of Christ while doing so. If this was a challenge presented by God, then he would face it head on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;But I am hungry now.&#39; They said to themselves, before taking a bite. Quietly, they munched through one apple, then another. Savoring every bite, and not letting a single core go to waste.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Andreas stood by the edge of the flower field, watching the child Servant devour one apple after another. Despite Gabriele&#39;s best efforts to pry information out of them, their identity remained a mystery. Now that Gabriele had left, they no longer seemed keen to interact. 

But Andreas was a patient man. Punctuality was relative. Plus, he had arrived at Berenice with several weeks to spare before the Grail would manifest. He could afford to wait, be it minutes or hours.

And so the contest was on.

As the child finished the last apple, they turned to Andreas with what he could only describe as a deadpan look in their visor. There was no inquisitive tilt of the head, nor was there any excessive body language that indicated any curiosity like when they had socialized with Gabriele. The child simply turned their torso as a form of acknowledgement, as if they were saying &#39;Yes, Andreas, you exist.&#39;

Now what?

Andreas was still apprehensive of any magecraft the child may have casted on him and Gabriele. He hesitated to engage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They shook back their sleeves once more, exposing the damaged skin.
