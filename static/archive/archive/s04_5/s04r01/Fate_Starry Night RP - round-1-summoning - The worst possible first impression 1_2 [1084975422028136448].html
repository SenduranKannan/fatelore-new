&quot;That damn phony....&quot; When one imagines Egypt one imagines a burning sun ready to turn one into a sweaty mess. Except that is not always the case, it makes sense when one thinks about it, like in any part of the world seasons change. Had she not been in such a hurry after she received the news from her so called &#39;contact&#39; she would have picked something better to wear. 

In retrospective it made a bit more sense why she was having so many weird looks on the plane to this place. 

&quot;...Couldn&#39;t he warned me??&quot; a petite girl who looked no older than 16 years old wearing a long white cape which covered most of her body was walking through the streets. Holding on her shivering by pure strength of will as she didn&#39;t wanted people to notice that underneath that cape she was wearing nothing but a blouse and a pair of shorts. Silver lining, this does make it easier to move so on the long run it wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue. 

Normally she would be using her flames to keep herself warm, but she had just entered a foreign land which more likely than not was bound to become a freaking mess regardless of her actions. Which was fine, she had come here for that very reason,  but she knew better than attract attention before she got ready. 

She reached a cheap motel and leaved her luggage before leaving once again. Part of her wished she had packed some more warm clothing but it was too late for such though. By the time she left her motel it was already dark, another silver lining from winter but even then for her it wasn&#39;t worth the cold. 

She moves fast, the advantage of such small and light body. She moved away from the noise and into a more secluded location. There is a high change what she is about to do can cause a lot of trouble so she is preparing for the worse.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t helping her due to the kindness of his heart, he would probably get something out of this somehow besides his payment obviously. 

Even when politics weren&#39;t her strong suit, she knew how business went. She had deal with enough backstabbers and manipulative monsters for a lifetime. Part of her wished she didn&#39;t had to be here, she wished that she could be home. But what was the point? Home was gonna disappear in a few years, so she needed to risk it. 

She pulled a leather book and as she light up one of her fingers with a tame flame she began to flip through the pages. It was something relative simple, it was suspicious but she didn&#39;t had the luxury of doubt right now. She light some wood from the rubble and make a small torch as she began to work. 

It took her around and hour to get everything ready, she could had finish early but Ritcher handwriting was a mess. She stood before the circle she had drawn in the ground as she took a deep breath she pulled a photo from one of her pocket and stare at it for a moment that felt like an eternity before she put the picture away. She open the book and moved the page as she began to read an incantation. 

&quot;... An oath shall be sworn here. I shall attain all goodness from the heavens and my flames shall burn all that is evil in the earth.

The wind is strong today, not because of the weather but because of <em>that</em>. As the light scattered and later faded, a silhouette can be observed. Getting clearer, it appears that it is wearing an attire that can only be found in the orient; Japanese garments to be specific. Their physique is small but tall, their skin is fair and as smooth as silk, and their face is that of a young girl. In their right hand is a sword with a blade that is shaped in a wavy pattern. The young fellow stares at the lady in front of them emotionlessly before breaking the silence with their voice.

&quot;I, Servant Saber, have come forth to answer your summons.

I believe it is you who called for my presence?&quot;

Their words are articulated with a voice that is soft and a tone that is stern. Waiting patiently for a response, they continue gazing in silence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was something akin to a reflex, she didn&#39;t knew what she was gonna summon after all. Ritcher had explained her some of the rules of what a holy grail war included which were also in the tome but even then she was far from being an expert. 

The way she understood it was that servants were sort of familiar which basically came in all sorts of shapes and sizes which to a degree meant this was a really important toss of a coin in more than one sense.  She needed a servant powerful enough to take her to the end of this battle and with an open mind so they could work together. Such ideal combination would be something hard to get at least in her mind as she really had no idea who she was summoning. 

For her who was used to clean with threat after threat her mind couldn&#39;t help but assume the worse so she got ready but as soon as she open her eyes this widen at the sight in front of her. Power, she could feel power coming from the being in front of her but even if that was the case all the servant would be able to see in her face was pure confusion. 

&quot;Saber? You?&quot; it wasn&#39;t mean that much as a disrespect but more like complete and utter shock as his appearance didn&#39;t reflect power nor strength. &quot;... are you really the strongest?&quot;

That much she remember, Saber was the strongest class so if she managed to get it, it really increased her chances of winning but perhaps the information was wrong?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their face eventually relaxed as they believe that masters, especially the youth, have every right to be concerned with the strength of their servant. Perhaps making things clear would dispel their woes.

&quot;That&#39;s right, I have been summoned as a Saber-class servant.

As for being the strongest, you can count on me as your loyal familiar.&quot;

Servant class, Saber. Servants under this class are not just known for their skill in swordsmanship but are also recognized for their high ratings across all six parameters, it is not wrong to call them the most powerful kinds of servants around. This Saber is no different, they may be everything one may want in a Saber-class servant. Though it does make them wonder, what&#39;s causing this girl to question their strength without even seeing them in action?

Could it be the sword? No, anyone would think twice before willingly accepting a strike from a sword shaped like this. Could it be their presentation? Maybe, perhaps it wasn&#39;t grandiose enough for this young lass. Could it be what their wearing? They probably would look weird to the people, especially the youth, of today. Oh how the kids always worry about these things, they should know better! Thought after thought, Saber kept thinking.

&quot;Do you not believe in my skill as a warrior?&quot;

It is better to ask about what could be bothering them. Not voicing these kinds of questions would most likely end up in the other not voicing their concerns as well, Saber knew that better than anyone else.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well that really hit her concerns straight on, she knew Saber was powerful we at least powerful than her but that was part of the reason of her concerns. She did knew she wasn&#39;t that powerful, she had all sorts of limits which she had been forced to face since an early age, that didn&#39;t mean she was helpless or that she couldn&#39;t deal with some of those so called strongest than her but it was not such a simple matter and depended in conditions. 

&quot;Well less than not believing you really just dont look the part.&quot; 

It was a valid concern at least in her eyes, Saber frame didn&#39;t look that different from her sure he was a bit taller. But on looks alone he didn&#39;t seem that physically strong, he could be as skilled as few but that could also mean that he was somewhat dependent of his tools. The more she began to think about this she wondered if maybe this Saber was a bit too similar to her?

&quot;I have a goal I need to achieve so I need to make sure you are the strongest piece I can get. I need someone who can beat the enemy regardless of how powerful they are. Are you capable of that?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, it&#39;s going to be a little hard if it&#39;s going to be with this kid but she is still his master.

Despite his displeasure, Saber feels like he can understand the concern about his strength. It is his duty as a familiar to win the grail for his master... after all, what good is a servant who lacks the capabilities to even win the Holy Grail?

&quot;Master, be rest assured that, for as long as I am with you and you are with me, victory shall be ours. <strong>From this time forth, my sword shall be with you and your fate shall be with me.
—Now, our contract is complete.</strong>&quot;

Saber stood straight before giving a bow, fully acknowledging this young lass to be his master. Whatever happens next, for all the trials and tribulations in his master&#39;s life from this point onwards, Saber will fight for her. Saber is confident in his abilities, he has to be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She let out a sigh as she took another look at Saber, leaving her first impression to the side appearances could be deceiving so she would have to take the gamble and believe in Saber. Well this whole thing was a huge gamble to begin raising the stakes didn&#39;t change the situation much. 

&quot;My name is Gloria Ignis, I am telling you right away I am gonna do everything in my power to survive till the end to win no matter who I have to kill. Well I say that but I&#39;m not gonna go around killing innocent people.&quot;

Yes, Gloria had her own code when it come to this things. She wouldn&#39;t show any mercy to her enemies but innocent bystanders was different story. While she was no hero and knew casualties were bound to happen she would try her best to  minimize them. There was a logical reasons, keeping the secrecy of magic and whatnot, the integrity of this ritual as if things went to hell her chance for her wish did as well so people playing nice actually worked on her favor. 

&quot;Lets try to find some balance and get along as fellow women&quot; she said as she extended her hand towards Saber. &quot;Alright Saber?&quot; she said with a smile.

She hadn&#39;t realize that the servant in front of her was a man, his apperance and voice all make it look feminine and honestly she was okay with it. If only she knew that wasn&#39;t the case.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Determination is one thing, saying one is willing does not automatically guarantee that they are true to their words... though it may precede doing, it also precedes undoing. There is a saying that promises are meant to be broken, but it cannot be applied here. There is so much to lose here if one were to fail to stand by their code of ethics and rules of engagement, not just the Holy Grail but themselves as a person. Despite these pessimistic thoughts, Saber must believe in his master... and he expects his master to believe in him as well.

Though it does not matter, as Saber knows she is true. Her smile, her gesture, it all seems genuine even if the earlier doubts may make it appear insincere... Saber just has a feeling, that is all. Huh? Fellow woman? Well, Saber always has been known for his pretty girly face so it wouldn&#39;t surprise him that someone would mistake him for a girl. Saber responded by also extending his arm out, he is happy to know his master acknowledges his existence and his role as her servant.

&quot;Alright, let&#39;s win the grail, master!

...

Though, I must say...
I am a <em>man</em>.&quot;

What he said might be a little awkward, but it shouldn&#39;t hurt to clarify his gender. It isn&#39;t that big of a deal, right?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A chill wind make her hold her her sides under her mantle as due to the different emotions and though that had come at after working on this circle for the past hour she kind of forgot about the cold. 

But as she relax once again she heard something that would once again make her forget about the cold

&quot;Uh?&quot; 

Did she hear her right? Well him? 

&quot;You are a man?&quot; it was quite a shock for her. It was even somewhat amusing as Saber whole being would make normally one thing he was a woman. 

&quot;That actually sounds quite interesting I wonder if maybe we can use those looks for our advantage?  Still You are quite beautiful if you hadn&#39;t told me you were a man I honestly wouldn&#39;t believe it.&quot; She began to walk away.

Saber took a sigh of relief and followed Lady Ignis to wherever she is going... lady or princess? She looks really young, probably nearing the end of their teenage years even. Saber thought whatever, he thinks she&#39;s going to say something about it once the subject comes up. Now wouldn&#39;t be a good time as it could upset someone while they&#39;re in a good mood.

&quot;Been there, done that&quot;, Saber chuckled a bit, clearly implying that he may have done something clever with the use of his looks. &quot;Let&#39;s go then, master.&quot;

Saber <em>sheathed</em> his sword and continued to walk alongside her. By sheath, he kind of just used the &quot;belt &quot; of his outfit to hold it and inserted it through with the only thing keeping it from falling through being the guard of the sword. It&#39;s tightly worn though, so it shouldn&#39;t be something to worry about... maybe Saber should get a waist belt to carry the sword, a scabbard won&#39;t be practical simply because of how it is shaped.

&quot;Master, I suggest we look for some gear after you rest. I... I could really use something&quot;

There are some conveniences present now that Saber never had in his time.. actually they did exist before. Perhaps Saber never had it in his life or just was not summoned with it, regardless the issue would be resolved as soon as they obtain what he needs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still there was much she still didn&#39;t knew of this situation as time was on the essence for her so she hadn&#39;t read all of the noted Ritcher had left from her in that book he gave her. It was understandable for her hurry as from Ritcher had told her about the ritual it was just 7 pairs so in her mind she losing her chance to summon a servant and participate was real danger even though once those seals appeared on her hand it was already a sure deal. 

That aside she had decided to focused on getting herself a servant first instead of gathering information as that the main qualification to enter and it would help her against anyone trying to get an early start. It was what she would do honestly, take the chance to end the competition by taking down a master before of while summoning their servant. Now even if they were to get into a fight it would be somewhat even. 

&quot;Oh? Well that is okay, we need to get ya some clothes as well if that isn&#39;t what you meant I can&#39;t have you walking around with me wearing that.&quot; she said as she pointed at the man&#39;s Japanese&#39;s clothes &quot;It makes ya look nice and all but we would end up sticking out like a sore thumb and we may attract enemies that way.&quot;

Her words were product of experience but at the same time to ignorance. Due to lack of knowledge she sort of ignore what a servant existance really was so she didn&#39;t ignore basic stuff like Saber being able to take spiritual form but also how different from humans they were even if their shape was the same. 

&quot;Is a good thing is night already so for now we should be okay.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
