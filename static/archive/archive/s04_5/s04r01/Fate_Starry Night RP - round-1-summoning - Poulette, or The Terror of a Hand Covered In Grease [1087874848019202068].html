One of them had a bargain to uphold - and it was borne on the shoulders of the mighty culture of Kentucky.  A single land so powerful that even in the previously unknowable world of the Mohammadeans, those who had been the enemies of all civilized folk in the time of Assassin&#39;s life, it remained as an eternal testament of their mastery.  Over seas and sand had the works of Kentucky come, and now, it was time to appreciate it as the fine art it was.

I mean, if you can call putting some oil on a chicken &#39;art&#39;.

Maybe it was just food.

Some hours after they had parted at the store, Triboulet had decided to end this excursion empty-handed - whisps of unusual mana and a vague sense of foreboding was all she had to work with.  The other Masters were either sensible enough to hide themselves elsewhere, or she simply wasn&#39;t that good of a bloodhound, but clearly the latter wasn&#39;t possible so that leaves only so many options.  Riding the air between two rows of buildings like a rail, passing over heads, she now turned her attention towards the miserable soul that was James Rellum.

Triboulet took no breath, but mimed drawing it in, and drew back the same vivacity she put on display last time.  It came easier than expected.  Her eyes widened, she felt a lightness in her chest that kept her up, and she could feel expectations working their way up.  Eyes were upon her...

...literally, as she had manifested physically for a moment.  She appeared as a cloaked figure with a wide-brimmed hat, her bright outfit hidden underneath.  This obviously furtive appearance didn&#39;t do much to get attention away from her, as a greengrocer sitting in her stall across the street had seen the weird dwarf walk out from an alley dressed like the villain in a movie, grinning in a malicious way beneath the brim.

James had some peace and quiet in the intervening time, so now he was ready to be re-immersed in misery.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087875067465179270 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087875067465179270><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 21, 2023 6:07 PM">6:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>I&#39;m about ready to return,</em> said that growingly familiar voice in his head, <em>I&#39;ve claimed the heads of 20 Servants and their Masters in the meanwhile - you&#39;ve upheld your end of the bargain, right?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The air was still tense nonetheless. There was a Holy Grail War ongoing and he was out without a Servant. He was an easy target. But he needed to succeed in this mission of his. That chicken was more than worth the risk!

<em>rumble</em>

His stomach thought so, at least. 

.

..

...

The adventure was thought to be an impossible one. His path got diverted by multiple tourist traps and attractions forcing to take detour after detour. Just when he was about to cut his losses short, the glorious sight of the local KFC in distance was enough to bring a man to his knees. James kept his composure though, of course. No one else was around to prove it otherwise, after all!

With the prize in his arm, he made his way back to the rundown store, aka their headquarters, while taking a different path. It made the trip back take longer but you can never be too careful. He had <em>just</em> the right Magecraft on hand to keep the chicken at a perfect temperature. This meant the fear of the quality diminishing due to it getting cold wasn&#39;t an issue. 

The smell was nostalgic to him. He was reminded of the sounds of joy his daughter made whenever he came home with some food. Which she definitely wasn&#39;t allowed to eat but how could he say no to her?

He froze in place for a second before looking at his waist; it was Mister Fluffybuns. Right. He forgot he placed him there. Maybe that&#39;s why he wasn&#39;t attacked so far. Superstition, of course. But, that didn&#39;t stop a subtle smile from forming on his face from the thought alone. &quot;Gotta remember to leave a piece for you. I wouldn&#39;t want to get earful for forgetting to feed you, after all.&quot; He said before he continued onwards.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088339157056753734 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088339157056753734><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 23, 2023 12:51 AM">12:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Some time after</code>
Surprisingly, he made it back first. Or she was waiting for the perfect opportunity to make her entrance. He wouldn&#39;t put it passed her, if he was being honest. Regardless, this allowed him to set up a small table, with tableware cleaned to the best of his abilities, before she arrived.

Just as he finished up, he received a shock when he heard her voice inside of his mind this time. Oh god. He really can&#39;t be truly rid of her if they have this kind of connection, huh?

Before he responded, a small sigh was made as he slowly came to terms with this new form of communication between them, and all the implications it entails. <em>&#39;If that actually was true, which I doubt, I would parade through Berenice in that ridiculous outfit of yours in joy.&#39;</em> There was subtle fear in the back of his head that, by some astronomical odds, she did perform such a feat. <em>&#39;But yes, I upheld my end of the deal.

James doesn&#39;t hear laughter, but it isn&#39;t hard to imagine that in some corner of the world, she&#39;s probably doubling over herself from pulling off this relatively stupid prank. 

<em>We get even less out of it than you do!  Mana in the slightest amount, certainly, but it&#39;s nothing compared to what I&#39;m taking from you.</em>  She apparently decides transmitting an undignified snort is important.  <em>Oh, forgive me for my impudence!  Wasting my Master&#39;s valuable funds for but a slight curiosity.  I should be hung for this, but they don&#39;t make a gallows tall enough to snap the neck of one as light as me.</em>

The greengrocer across the street from Triboulet had decided at that point that what she&#39;s seeing is some dumb foreigner&#39;s kid trying to act intentionally suspicious, or just some insane person.  There&#39;s no end to tourists and their lack of responsibility.  For all of her concern and indignation, she had few tools to resolve the situation - all she could do was hold up a bundle of green onions and shout in her direction &quot;Go home!  You shouldn&#39;t be out here alone!&quot;...in Arabic.

It was only her surprise when the girl looked up at her, all wild-eyed, and shouted back &quot;Grant me passage, o&#39; merciful farming woman, for your sand-and-sun-worn visage is just as hideous as that of the most terrible troll guarding a bridge&quot; in perfectly intelligible but slightly accented Arabic!  The foreigner laughed and then walked back into the alley from whence she emerged.

This wouldn&#39;t be the end, though.  Tourist kid or not, if she was smart enough to understand her, she was absolutely smart enough to understand the universal language of the sandal.  The greengrocer took one of hers off, stormed across the street and toward the alley, ready to fully illustrate the importance of treating the locals kindly...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088894549457379469 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088894549457379469><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 24, 2023 1:38 PM">1:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...only to find an empty wall.

This incident would be a point of contention later between her and her husband, who stressed the importance of keeping under cover from the sun to avoid this kind of heat-induced hallucination.

Once again bounding around the world in spirit form, making a beeline straight to James&#39; position, Assassin spoke once more after a brief pause.  <em>If you did not know this simple fact, Master, then we can discuss the vagaries of Servant life over this meal - there will be no teacher more truthful and educated than I.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As if she knew of his current state of emotions, the snort only added on top of everything. Maybe she was just watching from afar and tormenting him so. She <em>was</em> an Assassin after all. Hiding in the shadows was their specialty. Great. It looks like his guard can&#39;t ever go down for a second, especially against Assassin.

Luckily, he wouldn&#39;t need to read up on much if she was willing to tell him about Servants herself. <em>&#39;That would be appreciated...&#39;</em> A certain level of caution was still held though. It was still <em>her</em>, after all.

She had assumed that a meal between the two of them would be elsewhere, somewhere more exciting...but at the very least, it wasn&#39;t in that back room.  Small victories, no?  Assassin&#39;s face turned to reflect that prior bright and cheerful exterior, and with a dramatic sweep of her cape...

...yes, she was still wearing an outfit appropriate to the villain of an opera rather than a clown or, god forbid, something normal as she stood in the door jamb...

...she said &quot;Get thyself your dining implements of the finest aluminum, plates of gold!  I shan&#39;t be disappointed by an improper dining set up - as future victors, or those with no chance of survival, we shall not skimp on the tiniest of details.&quot;  Still hunched over, she made her way to the table and pried upon the bags of food.  

Opening up one bucket and looking down at the deep fried goods within, she looked like she was prepared to say something, but paused just before.  Her pale eyes stared down, and then she checked the second bucket - just the same, poultry aplenty.  She looked around the buckets at the sides provided, and then took a moment to compose her thoughts.

&quot;Master.  I thought you said we were dining on chicken?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And, probably just as expected at this point, Assassin was met with the unimpressed gaze of her Master sitting alone with the table adorned with the food he brought. 

&quot;We got plastic utensils and two regular plates.&quot; He so coldly responded. &quot;I just got to Berenice today so we&#39;ll have to make due with this until I can find the time to get actual cutlery&quot; Oh to be cursed with such squalor!

The moment the tops were taken off, to reveal the glorious fried chicken within, the waft of still hot, perfectly cooked KFC chicken entered the air. With plenty of fries as one of the sides provided, there was plenty to go around. It was almost impossible to be left wanting with so much to choose from! Well, or so James thought. 

He raised his eyebrow at her after seeing her reaction. For a second he thought her to be pulling his leg yet again. &quot;This is <em>chicken</em>.&quot; He pulled a drumstick out of the bucket as if to show her just in case her eyesight was faulty. &quot;The best kind this world has to offer.&quot; Without explaining further, he took the first bite between the two and savored the flavours that came with it. He was thankful that the chicken still tasted the same despite being so far from home.

Maybe he didn&#39;t need to get used to the local cuisine after all...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089755516445659320 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089755516445659320><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 10:39 PM">10:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;The best...this has been fried - to a <em>crisp.&quot;</em>  She put it down on her plate, not throwing it away but clearly unready for the world of modern cuisine just yet.  &quot;I thought this was some kind of strange bread at first, not that it was chicken broiled from the Devil&#39;s own larder!&quot;  Her hand peeled away the good part, i.e. the skin, and with a very much non-plastic knife she cut off a chunk of meat from it.  &quot;They&#39;ve done something strange to this meat...&quot;

She ate it with a moment&#39;s hesitation.  &quot;...mhghb.  Nough.  Schtill tashtes as Chickengm.&quot;  She chewed more.  &quot;Pecuhligher...&quot;

She swallowed, half-muttered something to herself, and then around the room after a moment.  &quot;Forgive me.  Even the greatest of improvisationalists have their pauses.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

Assassin threw a hand up.  &quot;I&#39;ve lost myself in this riddle, Master.  Tell me.&quot;  She leaned over the table, her eyes directly locked with his (and avoiding looking too hard at the unsavory foodstuff).  &quot;What joke are you playing on me?

Dinner <em>and</em> a show! This was great. Soon the last bite of his chicken was taken and the discarded bones were set on the plate. A few napkins provided was used to clean himself up a bit.

&quot;This isn&#39;t a joke, Assassin. You&#39;re just eating it wrong. Here.&quot; With another piece of chicken acquired, this time a wing, he held it with his fingers. &quot;Observe.&quot; After those words spoken came the next first bite into this piece of chicken. Skin and all. This man seemed to have some practice teaching others how to do things apparently. It came too naturally to him. 

To think that someone could stomach biting into such a greasy thing! Or at least, that <em>would</em> be the thought. James clearly didn&#39;t have such thoughts in his head. Just pure satisfaction after each bite. Maybe there was correct way to go about this.

&quot;Most of the seasoning and flavour lies within the skin, you see. There&#39;s nothing like the sensation of getting to bite into a satisfying crunch of some good chicken.&quot; His eyes didn&#39;t drift over to watch Assassin attempt a second time. Whether she understood it or not was up to her now. More chicken for him if she doesn&#39;t, after all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091093416798068736 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091093416798068736><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 3:15 PM">3:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This kind of food that sat before her looked like the sort in the hands of the most rotund of nobles, or as she put it, &quot;This looks like the sort of food a man would eat, he who endeavors to die of gluttony before an assassin can get to him.&quot;

And his hands, by god, he was looking the part of an ogre too.  Eating like a drunk hog farmer, not a single utensil in sight!  It wasn&#39;t as if the sight was unknown to her, but the kind of people who let themselves become a body of spittle, grease and dripping beer were those too powerful or too unimportant to correct.  James, initially, seemed a stoic but refined man who didn&#39;t hold himself to the unrealistic standard of a bastard nobleman.  Now look at him, getting his hand all over the food...

Something was uniquely disquieting about the idea of chicken being &#39;crunchy&#39;.  You might as well ask to feel the chewiness of an orange, or enjoy the way a piece of mutton melts into a slurry.

Still.  Either this man had a much more rigid composure than he initially let on, or...he simply enjoyed this.  Assassin&#39;s face didn&#39;t do much to betray her internal indecision, only staring at him closely like she&#39;d somehow learn something from the way he went about his dinner.

It took another couple of moments for her to listen to his advice.  She took her previously dissected drumstick and used the knife to turn it on its side, and then impale it straight through the bone.  This way, she had a very dangerous-looking and unwieldy kebab for herself.  Eating around the knifepoint sticking out the other end, she tastes the way chicken is meant to be.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091153029681659934 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091153029681659934><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 7:12 PM">7:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Hmm.

This sort of startlingly straightforward and honest speech is hitherto unprecedented from this unsavory little--

&quot;Fine enough as food for a whole day!  You expect to eat this much,&quot; she holds out her hand at the bucket with a vicious grin, &quot;just between us two?  King or commoner wouldn&#39;t try to engorge themselves on <em>multiple</em> birds like this.  What, do you figure configuring a much fuller figure would fit as full armor against our enemies?  Dodging death by simply absorbing the blows in layers of fat, eh?&quot;

Much more like her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For him, eating chicken like was considered <em>normal</em>. Eating it any other way would make him appear strange and weird towards others who might be watching. So, the contrast between both worlds sitting at the table was missed by James himself as he enjoyed the bounty to himself. 

There was a moment where his expression changed to stare at her as if <em>she</em> was the weird one! How could she not fall into the arms that was the Colonel and their eleven herbs and spices! It wasn&#39;t long enough the lackluster brought forth another eye roll once she continued. 

Yeah, that was much more like what he expected from her. 

&quot;Remember I got this amount because I thought you needed to eat as well. I don&#39;t really prefer reheating chicken but leftovers will help us stay hidden for longer. No need to go out as often, you know.&quot; The man continued to engorge himself on chicken to ensure he gets his fill. The boat ride here was surprisingly long after all. That and he felt drained. Must have been the summoning but it felt like he was running on empty essentially. 

&quot;So, if you&#39;re done with calling me fat, why not tell me more about Servants so I don&#39;t end up making the same mistake or something?&quot; Right. The whole reason behind this little meeting of theirs. Of course he could always just read the book but it was old. He didn&#39;t know if there was a updated version or not. Plus, it was much better to get information from the source, even if the source was Assassin out of all people.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092221180448092242 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092221180448092242><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 2, 2023 5:57 PM">5:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And this was prior to her getting to the weird, nearly-flavorless biscuits.

Though she continued with her meal, it was finally time to get on with the business of this luncheon.  Assassin nodded, and gave a self-satisfied exhalation.  &quot;I am not done with that, but surely we can take a break from it.  Our continued survival is only second to the comedy, but I understand the need to vary it every once in a while.&quot;

&quot;The lot of us, great men of history, demigods, monsters and leaders, we shall fight to the death, so long as you are not incompetent!  I am a humble whipping boy who would <em>surely</em> have no pretensions to kill those above my station,&quot; she winked for some reason, &quot;but we are only bound by an agreement to win.  I&#39;m sure at least one other Servant in this war has killed their Master, perhaps because they don&#39;t like their ugly faces.&quot;

That can be saved for later. He will be prepared mentally by then to endure that process, hopefully...

The topic was soon shifted, thankfully, to the one suggested in the first place; Servants.

Well, he <em>would</em> be thankfully if he could actually understand what she just said when she decided to speak with a full mouth. &quot;Uh huh, riiiight...&quot; Maybe the book was the right choice after all. To avoid looking like the fool between the two of them, James simply nodded and allowed Assassin to continue on in hopes that he could learn <em>something</em> useful. 

The mention of command spells brought his attention to the back of his hand. The same butterfly-like design with diamond wings was open for the world to see. He knew about these and what they were capable of, fortunately. Maybe he should get a glove to hide it while he&#39;s outside. After a short glance was made, he returned to listening and enjoying his meal while making sure to keep making glances at Assassin to show that he was, in fact, still listening. Whether he was actually absorbing what she was saying was still up in the air, at least from the looks of it.

<em>&quot;... I&#39;ve no need for water or bread, just keep by and I&#39;ll live...&quot;</em>

That&#39;s easy enough of maintenance to remember. Take care of himself and he will be doing the same for Assassin. It&#39;s like having the easiest pet to take care of! That felt relieving to hear though. 

&quot;I know there are seven classes which means six opponents for us to face and take out. I only know them by name but not what they might be capable of.&quot; Before he continued, he made sure to finish his food so he wasn&#39;t talking with a full mouth, <s>like a decent person!</s> &quot;Who would be the easiest targets to go after for us, in your opinion?&quot; He hopes that he doesn&#39;t end up regretting that last part...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092901540953591868 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092901540953591868><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 3:00 PM">3:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way she arranged her foes internally tended to go on a very small scale, ranging from &quot;There shan&#39;t be a challenge at all - for them&quot; to &quot;I suppose we may not be wholly ruined!&quot;  This one time, though, she decided to put things a little more positively.  This man seemed like he could use every ounce of confidence he could scrabble his weary hands on, especially considering the bad news she was about to drop.

&quot;There should be no target easier than the Master itself.&quot;  She put her chicken down and took a sip of the mysterious black drink, which was overpoweringly sweet in ways she didn&#39;t know was possible.  She puckered her mouth for a moment, perhaps in a mirror of the same distaste that James might feel when considering that tactic.  &quot;I-It is what the Assassin is born for!  Even an un-Assassin like me.  A moment unawares, and I&#39;d already have them dead.  Nasty stuff,&quot; she admits just for his sake, &quot;but it&#39;s not as if you&#39;d have to see it or do it yourself.&quot;

&quot;Beyond that?  Anyone who would look upon us - old and uneducated man, feeble clown who&#39;s barely tasted death - and decide to underestimate us.  With that, we could topple kings and gods.&quot;

It&#39;s not much solace, but it&#39;s at least something.

&quot;Though,&quot; she holds up her hand, but can&#39;t bear to keep her malicious mirth inside anymore, &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re a bit wrong on one thing.  This isn&#39;t just us seven.&quot;

&quot;This is quite the queer war, it seems.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got <em>far</em> more than 6 others trying to kill us.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sounds simple enough. That is probably our best shot honestly all things considered.&quot; He slowed down his gluttonous ways and focused more on the fries for now. Taking out the Masters made sense to him. He did get an Assassin Class Servant, after all. If that didn&#39;t tell him what kind of tactic he should adopt, then he might as well call it a loss already.

Although, despite his rather stoic expression, a weight was placed on his shoulders. He knew this was a possibility the moment he decided to go through with this plan of his. However, to be cornered solely with choice of needing to go after the Master rather than face off against their Servant brought reality ever closer to him. <strong>He might be forced to kill another</strong>.

<em>Just how many lives was his daughter&#39;s worth?</em>

That question would soon haunt his mind for weeks to come.

Fortunately, or unfortunate, depending on one&#39;s views on the matter, his attention would be brought Assassin&#39;s last words spoken.

<em>&quot;We&#39;ve got far more than 6 others trying to kill us.&quot;</em>

&quot;That can&#39;t be right...&quot; James spoke in disbelief, almost expecting Assassin to reveal this was another cruel joke of hers. &quot;A Grail War consists of seven Servants and seven Masters. I at least know that much, Assassin. How could there be more than the seven? Doesn&#39;t that break the rules of this whole thing?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093028970850697237 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093028970850697237><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 11:26 PM">11:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rules?  Oh, Master, what do you figure we&#39;re participating in?  A game?  Let me fetch the local master of ceremonies, and ask for the others to be <em>ejected!</em>  AHAHAHA!&quot;

She then fell backwards, her eyes opening wide for a split second after she had tipped her chair too far along and came down with it.  Thankfully, there wasn&#39;t much of a <em>thump</em> to knock about their food, just a clattering and a muffled &quot;Oh, shite&quot; beneath the clamor.

Assassin stuck her head up from the floor after a few seconds, pushing her hat back on and, seemingly, acting like nothing happened.  &quot;If it&#39;s but the will of God to have a game like ours, in contest for His greatest prize, do you think He would allow for something out of his design?  God&#39;s made many mistakes, but the man seems sound in his ability to run an event.&quot;  She quickly clacked her chair back into place and got a replacement thigh for the drumstick on the floor, taking a seat once again.  &quot;It is not <em>regular,</em> but it isn&#39;t <em>illegal</em> either.  Makes sense, no?&quot;

She peeled off some skin from her meat, downing it by itself this time.  &quot;We find ourselves somewhere in the vicinity of 20 others, I would imagine.  All of them focused on this one city!  If anything&#39;s left standing by the end of it, then I suppose God made another mistake if he wanted this place gone from His planet.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I suppose that does make sense, as unfortunate as that may be...&quot; James leaned back in the chair and stared up at the ceiling. His vibrant eyes just barely visible underneath his shades. &quot;That would be my kind of luck, all things considered.&quot; He spoke under his breath, almost as if it was meant to be towards himself. A sigh followed shortly after all. 

&quot;The best we can do is hope that the heavy hitters take each other out then I guess.

She didn&#39;t laugh or smile at his clear dismay over their chances, and instead patiently listened until he was finished - until he had asked his question.  It is one that she had waited for him to ask this whole time, and it was one that she clearly had an answer for the moment she came into this world.

&quot;Master...oh, <em>James,</em> please.  You doubt me like this?  I can see it in your eyes,&quot; she held up two fingers across the table, right in front of his face, &quot;the shame you feel upon looking at me.  Only normal, considering who you are looking at...but wrong all the same.  I&#39;ve told you twice already.&quot;

&quot;I.&quot;

<em>&quot;Cannot.&quot;</em>

&quot;Die.&quot;

&quot;...unless I so desire to.&quot;

She sat for a moment with her arms theatrically held in the air, letting James react - whether it was gobsmacked awe or a flat utterance of &#39;bullshit&#39;, or something between, she was eagerly awaiting it - before holding up her hand to get him to stop, and then drew it to the side of her mouth to conspiratorially whisper.  &quot;Now, listen close, for I shall <em>never</em> explain this joke again.  That is a rule of comedians, <em>comedy,</em> to never make things truly certain.&quot;

&quot;[Le Roi est Amus&#233;].  The Noble Phantasm of this weak soul.  As long as I act as I am, mocking with all aplomb and enjoying myself, making others laugh, simply being <em>funny,</em> there is nothing on God&#39;s Earth that shall make me depart from it.  Even if you had a bullet locked in a firearm that could kill a Servant on contact, placed it to my head and pulled the trigger, I would avoid it as long as I stuck out my tongue, glibly made a remark over it being a waste of lead, and took a bow as I mimed an exit from the stage.

Elation!  Not the derisive grin she usually had or anything made to work as a show, she just genuinely looked happy.  He hadn&#39;t proven himself useless prior, as he had <em>some</em> kind of reaction to her antics, but this was vital ground being broken.  This was the sort of first step needed between them to get somewhere, and for once, she was happy to simply go along with him.

It could&#39;ve been for a joke, though, and not just telling him about what use she is to him.

Small steps.

...you know what they say about a man with small feet, yes?

I thought so.

On one foot and holding up a pair of knives balanced blade-to-fingertip, she too reverted more to her theatrical persona.  &quot;Why, I&#39;m glad your brilliance has deigned me fit to no longer be ignored!  Simple exhaustion can indeed be a game we can play; though I may draw from you, were it needed I could suffice on my own.  I&#39;d sooner think that these people would kill themselves than be around me for that long, though.&quot;

With careful gauging of weight and a shift in her foot, she drew a third dagger and began to juggle them.  Dinner and a show!  &quot;That is not entirely a joke, either!  So many of history&#39;s greatest have piss-poor lives behind them, and I&#39;m sure that I can find what can truly ruin them, just by poking and poking and tearing into them.  Sure, only some of these losers would go and find a Heroic Rope, but those that I don&#39;t make into a sad sack like you, I&#39;ll enrage.  A bull with a red curtain over its head could be hamstrung even by someone as weak as me!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096199753160728616 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096199753160728616><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 13, 2023 5:26 PM">5:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then, mid-juggle, the blades turned and landed in sequence, impulsed by deft hands until their tips were pointing downward again - she juggled them, finger-to-point, not pausing and continuing onward with a short self-satisfied chuckle.  &quot;If we can&#39;t enrage them and <em>I</em> can&#39;t kill the Masters, as we&#39;re <em>very just and kind murderers,</em> then why not try and fool around with the people holding their leash?  They&#39;re often making decisions on the part of those sword-hauling dullards of warriors, so let&#39;s see what they do when they&#39;re well-and-truly distracted?  Hell, the humble James Rellum could perform a side-act and simply kill them while they&#39;re distracted by my badgering.&quot;

&quot;And if all of that does not work...hmm, I dunno.&quot;  She pushed the daggers upward with one final rotation, and then turned her head to the sides as they came down.  One landed in each of the long tassles of her hat, hanging there like ersatz earrings, while the third was caught by the other two, blade-to-handguard, as they all came to rest.  &quot;I&#39;m quite fortunate, until I&#39;m not.  If there&#39;s no fear to be had in my fight, I just have to hold out and hope that God thinks it is my turn to win.  I deserve a victory or two, I think!&quot;

She looked down at him, in the rare position of standing above his head, hand on chin.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry.  I&#39;d even suggest that you stay in hiding, because what are you going to do?  Make them think of their disapproving fathers?  Leave it all to me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The delicate act of balancing, then juggling, knives was more than enough to show him her dexterity and skill. They were more like extensions of her body than anything else. 

However, it wouldn&#39;t really be one of her shows if he didn&#39;t receive a few jabs his way and came they did. He wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> much of a sad sack now! Despite that, there was no real words he could say as a comeback to that. Deep down, he kind of knew that already. The weight upon his shoulders were taking his toll. Hell, merely accepting these jabs instead of biting back simply added to that fact! At least there was chicken to help mask it by eating though.

&quot;So what? Am I to be your assistant in your little shows? The straight man to your comedy act?&quot; A pause was done to partake in another bite before continuing. &quot;I am not as useless as you may perceive me to be, you know?&quot; Although he didn&#39;t like to show off, it was only fair given that Assassin showed him one of her main tricks, of course. 

&quot;Here.&quot; With complete confidence in her, James reached behind and pulled out one of his Silver Nails only to toss it towards her while she was balancing the knives. How good was her improv skills James wondered? He&#39;ll find out in a few seconds. &quot;I have a few tricks of my own to rely on as well.&quot;

A simple focus on his circuits through his hand and soon enough the Silver Nail began to glow red with heat. No matter how intense the heat became, James refused to flinch, not even as a joke. To prove it wasn&#39;t just an illusion, James decided to press the tip against one of the bones of the chicken he finished. Quickly, it was proved that his magecraft wasn&#39;t an illusion to the eyes. 

&quot;With this Magecraft of mine, I&#39;m capable of focusing mana to a single point of my body, in this case my hand, to quite the effect. I don&#39;t need to worry about burning myself either. Simple but effective.&quot; To avoid having the Silver Nail burn down the store, James simply held onto it until it cooled down. 

&quot;Apart from being a decent Magi, I also got these.&quot; His gaze was set downwards towards the table while his free hand shifted his shades down his face. The lack of eye contact prevented his Mystic Eyes from going off on Assassin. This gave her a rare glimpse at his strange eyes. &quot;All I need to do is lock eyes with another without these shades and I can get access to anything they may hide inside of their mind. I&#39;m not sure how useful that&#39;ll actually be in a fight but it&#39;s something.&quot; He gave it a few seconds before setting the shades back on his face so he could look up at her again.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096323731095310447 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096323731095310447><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 1:39 AM">1:39 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His nail cut off her lame gag, but didn&#39;t manage to get past her defenses.  Still keeping her knives in place, though the one free one did shake a bit more than before, she raised a foot with alacrity and intercepted it - it appeared stuck in the white fabric of the curly bit of her shoe.  After the nail moved in her foot a moment later - with her own eyes a bit wider after his test of an attack - it was clear that she had caught it between her toes.

Balancing on one leg, she grimaced a little.  &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want <em>that</em> sort of humor out of me, eh?  I&#39;ll keep such out of my mouth.&quot;

She set her foot down, giving James his nail back by tossing it with her foot, sending it back down into the table with enough force to keep it sticking upright.  Then, she decided to sit back down, pulling the knives from her tassels and leaving them beside her food.  She watched his display of applying his mana directly with quiet reverence - beyond a quick quip of &quot;So that&#39;s what you meant by reheating&quot; - and then at the showing of his strange eyes.

In truth, beyond just insulting him to keep the man from being comfortable - when you&#39;re a <em>bouffon</em> you simply never want anyone to be anything besides laughing or mildly enraged - she really didn&#39;t think her Master could bring much to the fight.  It&#39;d make sense, after all!  She&#39;s useless, so naturally she&#39;d appear with a useless partner.

Think of how cruel I could get with my humor!&quot;  She raised a finger from her cheek, leaving behind a bit of grease on its pale surface.  &quot;Really, though, if you ask me to leave the Masters to you...well, at least you aren&#39;t making it a failing prospect from the get-go.

If he could help keep her alive then their greatest trump card wouldn&#39;t fail them. Hopefully.

Then the question came. 

<em>&quot;Have you ever killed your fellow man before?&quot;</em>

It struck hard enough to give James enough pause to put a stop to eating. He seen death around him. It wasn&#39;t anything new to him. However, never did he have to take a life with his own hands before. It would be foolish to think that his hands would be clean after going through this. James knew this. He knew that he might have to take a life in order to get what he wanted. No matter how much you can steel yourself for it, unless you already have done it before, it isn&#39;t an easy task to undertake. So, the real question remains, could he do it?

&quot;No. If it came down to it though, <em>I would</em>.&quot; One didn&#39;t need to be a genius to notice that it wasn&#39;t something he looked forward too. It was just a grim inevitability he must have pondered over for while now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098461099185156107 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098461099185156107><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 11:12 PM">11:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once he admitted it, she nodded.  &quot;I see.  It&#39;s entirely the answer I expected.  Forgive me for being presumptuous.&quot;

She scoffed, and leaned back in her chair, raising a hand up.  &quot;If you&#39;ve got no experience in the matter, why not find out by testing it yourself?  Come, we&#39;ve got all sorts of trash out there for us to wet our knives.  Make the act easy on you.  Lowly drunks, politicians, lawyers - the kinds of folk who would elevate our status as heroes upon their slaying!&quot;

Having just suggested randomly murdering civilians, she certainly seemed happy and content.  She didn&#39;t laugh at her own joke this time, but instead soon after turned her head and looked away.

&quot;No.  It&#39;s not something that&#39;s ever easy, I feel.&quot;

...for a moment there, just a brief window, Triboulet looked, sounded and felt entirely serious.  No jokes followed regarding the matter, amazingly.  Could this be a...

&quot;Oh, look at us!  Are we holding a funeral...for the chickens we&#39;ve culled to provide for us?  No, no, none of that conscientiousness.&quot;  She quickly whapped herself on a head with a spare thighbone, producing a dull thud - just like that, whatever gravity she made had just disappeared.  &quot;I might be addled of the mind, but cry over a chicken?  Not this clown.&quot;

&quot;And, I will admit now, &#39;tis indeed a good meal, grease and all.  Is that a sign of insanity, though?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Of course not.&quot; A soft scoff was done to help with pushing the mood under the rug. For now, at least. &quot;That would make you the first clown I seen cry if that was the case. I&#39;m glad you came around to the chicken though.&quot; James returned to the feast until he ate his fill. The rest was set aside to be eaten later. Leftovers was still leftovers. There was no reason to be wasteful, especially if they wanted to avoid as many trips out into Berenice to keep a low profile. 

While it was comforting to get to know more about Assassin, James knew that he couldn&#39;t allow himself to get <em>too</em> close to her. The last thing he can afford was to view her as anything but just a familiar. There was a chance that, despite the abnormal number of participants, the Grail still demanded that all of the Servants be killed.

That meant the death of Assassin was an inevitability awaiting him at the finish line.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
