The glint of the needle&#39;s tip gave her enough indication to jump to the side and get to safety before the needle hit her.

“And you clearly don’t ever intend to be forty if you came here to fight me.&quot; She announced with unrestrained hostility. She clutched the side he&#39;d stabbed, then looked at the blood that stained her hand with a hard look. &quot;...I&#39;ll say it again, but the pile of frozen bodies was your cue to stay the fuck away from my mall.&quot;

Instead of rushing at him, Ann placed herself in the centre of the abandoned furs and blankets inside the crater. She grunted as she gently massaged her wound, and looked up to meet James&#39;... strange nebulous eyes. She then looked down at the strange weapons he held in each hand, scoffing once in a mocking manner.

“Been a while since I’ve been stabbed. Gotta say, needles hurt way less than knives. And they’re not the greatest tool for fighting either, if you ask me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The spare needle was stored away while he held onto the knife. 

Before he could catch up to her, she was already making her way down a frozen escalator. &quot;Oh shit...&quot; He knew that he wouldn&#39;t be able to catch up with her if he took his time getting to her. She was younger after all. Outrunning him wouldn&#39;t be that hard of a feat.

Maybe if he...

A sigh came from him as he realized just how stupid the idea he came up with was. &quot;I swear I really shouldn&#39;t be doing shit like this at my age...&quot; One of the railings looked sturdier than the other. It had to be that one! Soon, the sounds of snow being pushed off the railing was heard as the source of it was James sliding down to close the distance between the two. With one foot on the rail to provide him some support on his way down, James threw his weight towards Ann once he got close enough to prevent her from getting any further, and potentially closer to that damn Dragon of hers.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097993376126730283 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097993376126730283><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 4:13 PM">4:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a slightly cheerful smile, Ann descended the escalator and crossed the department store, the snow crunching loudly under the soles of her feet... but it wasn&#39;t long before she heard a second set of footsteps crunching in the snow behind her. She took a quick look behind her and saw that James was barely half a dozen meters behind.

Ann&#39;s athleticism should have given her the advantage in that chase, but the stab wound in her side throbbed painfully with each step she took, slightly bringing her speed down to match with James’. The distance between the two of them hardly changed as they ran, they were at somewhat of a standstill.

&quot;Fuck!&quot; She cursed, picking up the pace of her run. “Why are you even coming at me like this?! I don’t even know you, dude!!”

...truth be told, there were plenty of reasons for someone to come to Ann, considering the two mass murders she had been the indirect cause of. But reason or no reason, if he came at her with sharp needles and tried to stab her to death, she had no choice but to fight back. She looked around at the many stores that surrounded them as they ran. Clothing stores, cosmetics, appliances, furniture... and a hardware store, at the very end of the straight line they were running across. But more than the products sold inside, it was the frozen automatic sliding doors, which were slightly ajar, that caught Ann&#39;s interest.

After scrambling back onto his feet, the chase was resumed. The growing pains on his chest from the kick was slowly showing itself with each heave he made with his breathing. He can&#39;t allow to have this fight be too drawn out with how things are looking right now. 

&quot;Why are you confused with all of this? Isn&#39;t that damned dragon a Servant?&quot; The hardware store appeared to be her goal. Whether it was to arm herself, or simply escape him, he didn&#39;t ponder on it long before following suit. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you just stumbled into this whole thing without knowing a damn thing about it!&quot; Another Silver Nail was tossed towards her centre mass. Hopefully they gave James enough time to push and squeeze his way into the store.

The more James stared at her, the more he got annoyed by her antics. Why couldn&#39;t they just fight back there! There&#39;s no need to run around like this!

&quot;-super secret magic stuff!&quot; She continued, staring at the man in disbelief. The answer he gave only opened up more questions for Ann. First, how did he know about the Servants? Second, how did he know that Lindwyrm was one?

Was he also...

&quot;<em>A Master?</em>&quot; Ann&#39;s eyes widened in surprise as she made the connection. &quot;And that weird girl who threw a knife at me... she was a Servant... <em>your</em> Servant.&quot;

But he didn&#39;t look any different than a middle-aged man with greying hair! He may have had an unusual set of weapons, but the rest of his attire and demeanour was nothing like that of a Magus, or at least not compared to the one Ann knew. Even his whole vibe was more… <em>fatherly</em> than anything else.

Ann took a deep breath, then loudly exhaled the tension out of her body.

“What do you care if I randomly stumbled into this without knowing shit?” She said as she took a few steps back, not taking her eyes off the man. “I don’t need to know anything to do a lot of damage, and that goes both to this place-”

She flexed her legs and broke into a short sprint, leaping viciously at the man and swinging her bat to hit him anywhere he wasn’t protected.

&quot;-and to you!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It kept on annoying him the longer he thought about it! Who did she think she was for simply jumping into a death match with others so nonchalantly! Did she not understand the weight of entering this kind of thing?!

The bat pinged the Silver Nail away, causing it to leave somewhere in the hardware store. Unless he wanted to search through the snow, he can count that one lost. He doubted she would give him a timeout to look it anyways. 

Then she broke into a sprint towards him. 

Unless he wanted to endure a close brawl with her, now would have to be the time. Her eyes were fixated on him. She didn&#39;t know about his little trick. He just needed to time it well to avoid getting hurt <em>too</em> badly...

<em>&#39;Now!&#39;</em> James thought to himself as he broke into a sprint towards her as well to meet her halfway in hopes of ruining her momentum somewhat. The bat appeared to be made out of foam so he brought up his arm to block the incoming blow while reaching up to remove his shades to lock eyes with her. The nebulous nature of them seems to open up a whole new world inside of them and, were she to lock eyes with him, that is exactly what they&#39;ll end up doing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098678483749720184 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098678483749720184><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 1:36 PM">1:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While he thought the swing was harmless because the bat seemed to be made of foam, he was quickly proven wrong when his blocking arm recoiled in pain, as if hit with a bat made out of steel. That arm would surely bruise after the fight..

But that didn&#39;t matter to James, who was able to take off his shades and reveal his ace in the hole.

Ann didn&#39;t look him in the eye right away. Instead, she brought her bat back behind her head to prepare to deliver another blow, lifting her leg in the same motion to push the man back so that he was the perfect distance for a good swing, but at that moment, she inevitably met his gaze.

<strong>The world immediately fell apart around her</strong>.

Her vision blurred, distorted, and a veil of darkness invaded her eyes in an instant. The wound in her side, her opponent, the hardware store: everything disappeared from existence. Suddenly she could no longer feel the bat she held with her hands a few seconds ago, and in fact, all sense of touch and warmth inexplicably left her body at one point.

&quot;... !!&quot;

She opened her eyes wide, craned her neck and looked behind her, but was met with only infinite darkness. She tried to scream, but her mouth wouldn&#39;t open, or if it did, she couldn&#39;t feel it open and couldn&#39;t hear any words come out… no, she didn&#39;t hear anything at all.

Worse, <em>she didn&#39;t feel anything at all.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her heart sank.

Ann’s eyes widened in disbelief. She looked around like a frightened animal that had just been let loose in the middle of a busy city, the panic in her stare increasing with each passing second. She recognized this place. It was the bar where she had met her mentor a few weeks ago.

There was no fucking way.

She shook off Kathleen&#39;s grip and noisily dropped the stool she was sitting on to the ground as she took a step back.

&quot;What the hell am I doing here?!&quot; She loudly exclaimed, her panicked eyes landing on Kathleen, almost as if asking her for an explanation. &quot;Where&#39;s the old man I was fighting with a second ago?!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever happened, whatever <em>that man</em> did, brought her back to this point in time. Everything was just how she remembered. The smell. The temperature. The touch of her mentor. Everything was right down to the smallest detail. Even Todd was examining the bottles at his bar. 

It all felt too real to just be an illusion. Perhaps life was giving her a second chance at deciding whether or not to go through with this plan. Maybe the grail was at play here. A vision that she would get attacked a few weeks in the future? None of the answers made sense of the situation.

This made no sense. Just seconds ago, the bitter cold of the department store was assaulting her exposed skin after she shed her parka. She had a bleeding, throbbing wound on her side and a gash that kept bleeding on the side of her cheek. But when she brought her hand to her face and felt her skin, it was intact. The wound in her side seemed to have disappeared too.

She couldn&#39;t find the old man anywhere in the bar. Had he teleported her back to Illinoi with some king of magic bullshitery? But even then, that didn&#39;t explain why all of her wounds had closed.

Her breathing accelerated against her will. She looked at Kathleen wide-eyed, who seemed increasingly embarrassed and weirded out by her actions, and then at the indifferent and surprisingly calm bar owner, who was mindlessly wiping the bottles and glasses behind his counter.

Her pupils dilated to a single concentrated point of anger. She angrily stepped behind the bar toward Todd.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Those words held venom in them just as they did with anger. Out of all of the wishes to bring to the Grail, all she wanted was a damn <em>movie</em>? 

&quot;<strong>Just what kind of shit wish is that?!</strong>&quot; James exploded at Ann as his emotions were sent flying wild, all thanks to Ann herself as well. Set on meeting her halfway, he ran towards her with his hand up to catch her fist and swing one of his own. The less he traded blows with her, the more better off he would be, after all.

Just as they clashed though, half of the dreamscape created from Ann&#39;s memories was torn to pieces in a violent eruption. What James needed to maintain this world was a calm composure, lest his own memories start leaking through; an event that was unfolding before them.

A vibrant green landscape stretched on forever behind James. It was decorated with flowers and what seems like a tall treehouse in the distance. The gentle breeze upon his back told him all he needed to know what was going on. He needed to calm dow-</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Guhh!!” Blood trickled from the side of her mouth where she had been punched, which she licked off with her tongue. Her arm was already cocked back to retaliate, but she stopped herself short when a little girl appeared from nowhere to hug James from behind.

Daddy. Sweetie. They were most definitely father and daughter, and they seemed very close to one another. So close in fact that all of James&#39; anger and irritation left his body with a single hug from this little girl. 

&quot;...&quot;

Ann scoffed. She cocked her arm further back than before, gathering all of her strength in her fist before throwing her punch right in his face. 

&quot;I fucking knew you had fatherly vibes.&quot; She spat, a little mockingly. &quot;And? Did you bring that girl and those fields to make me feel sympathy for you? What, did you think I&#39;d sit back and let you win this fight just because you&#39;ve got a family to go back to? Or because my wish is <strong>shit</strong>?&quot;

She laconically shrugged her shoulders, before giving James the middle finger. It seemed that, no matter how selfish or inconsequential her wish was, she was gonna fight til the end.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A sense of panic overcame her as she thrashed, screaming her lungs out for him to come out and finally fight her, but her pleas fell on deaf ears and her scream stretched and died as she lost herself in the infinite void.

She suddenly opened her eyes and found herself in a different place. No bar in sight, no fields of grass. The air was cold and damp, and the only source of light came from the buzzing street lights all around her. She was in the middle of a familiar dirty curb, the distant hums and honks from driving cars betraying the calmness of the city at night.

She stopped and turned to face the voice shouting at her from a distance. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a man on the curb by the other side of the road. Gruff, a little disheveled, wearing what seemed to be construction worker clothes.

&quot;Stop, missy!&quot; He shouted again, far too loud for the quiet street. “I want to talk to you for a minute!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her arms dropped on either side of her body, the punk finding herself unable to take even a single step forward. Out of her still body phased an unclear and opaque silhouette which continued walking in the opposite direction from the man, the memory seemingly unfolding against her wishes.

The silhouette was considerably smaller than her, and she could barely pick the finer details, but she immediately recognised it. That awkward swaying as she walked, the head hanging low, how she kept her elbows tucked in as she clutched her small backpack as if to protect her body… it was a young Ann, maybe thirteen or so, scrawny and small even for her age. And that small Ann deliberately ignored the man who kept calling out to her as she briskly walked through the damp street in front of the grown-up Ann.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man quickly caught up with the small silhouette and violently yanked her back, leaving memory Ann to look up at him. It was hard to read her expression because of her opaque appearance, but the creasing of her eyes and the rigidity of her mouth pointed to it being somewhere between pleading and scared stiff. Nonetheless, the man didn’t take her facial cue as he spoke.

&quot;I saw you looking at me when you came around the corner,&quot; The man said, his breathing quick and erratic. &quot;Did I catch your eye? Strike your fancy?&quot;

Young Ann vigorously shook her head no and lowered her head to look down at her feet, unable to look the man directly in the eye any longer. Thinking this was that, she brought her shoulder back and tried to shake his grip and walk away. But the man squeezed her tighter, refusing to let go as if to say they weren’t done yet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nothing she could’ve done could’ve stopped what was happening... but now she had the true picture; he was just another low creep taking advantage of her. But she was just a little too small and inexperienced to retaliate.

Why didn&#39;t I fight him, she asked herself over and over again as the memory unfolded before her. It was like a horrible car crash where you couldn&#39;t tear your eyes off of the scene, except she was the car and the crash went on for way longer than a few seconds.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite her sincerest pleas, the man kept an iron grip on her shoulders, a constant reminder of the size and strength difference between them. She tried turning away from him, but the man immediately pulled her back to face him. The tears she held back began to fall down her cheeks.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Don&#39;t worry girlie, daddy will turn you straight.&quot; The man&#39;s mouth curled into a disgusting, yellow, toothy grin, and the skin around his eyes and nose stretched and made him look ten years older. 

He started walking in the opposite direction to where young Ann was going, dragging the girl by the arm, his grip so tight and strong that she couldn&#39;t help but wince in pain.

He dragged her into the first shady alley they arrived at, now out of sight, where Ann&#39;s muffled screams continued for seconds. Long seconds. Her voice broke after the first thirty seconds of screaming, her cries growing louder and longer as she realised how truly fucked she was in this situation. She screamed for help. She screamed at the man to stop. She screamed until her lungs turned into two large lumps of molten iron burning her body from the inside out. Until her vocal chords stretched, tore and ripped from the strain. Until her voice became unrecognisably sore and ungirly…

Then suddenly, she stopped screaming. Quiet wailing and sobbing replaced the screams. It was done.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It took Ann a few seconds after the screaming had stopped to go back to her senses. She didn’t even realize tears had started to gather at the corner of her eyes. She clenched her fists and turned away from the alleyway-

Then her heart dropped a second time.

The streets around her weren&#39;t empty. Two or three people were walking through the alleys as this was happening, ignoring her past self&#39;s screams as if they didn&#39;t exist at all. She thought she was alone then, but no, she wasn&#39;t. The harsh truth was that no one had bothered to save her, to speak up, to call anyone. Despite the screams, the pleas, the crying.

A torrent of violent emotions rose in her chest. She felt the contents of her stomach churn with disgust and anger. Disgusting. Unfair. Scum. They&#39;re scum. The man in the alley. The passers-by. The fucking old man bringing up the past. All of them, fucking scum.

Ann stayed up on her feet, her body somewhat limp, not twitching a finger or shifting her posture. She felt like screaming, thrashing, crying, yet she couldn&#39;t break down. Not here. Not ever. This wasn&#39;t reality… no, it was reality. But that happened a long time ago. She was different now. And she was still fighting this fucking old man. Had to keep going. Had to move on.

She took a long, shaky breath, the tears in her eyes almost falling from this act alone. Then she stomped away from the dark alley, the sobs of her past self growing fainter and fainter until they stopped altogether, the punk looking around maniacally with moist, bloodshot eyes in search of her tormentor.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had to be. 

As Ann travelled down the streets in search of him, the buildings appeared familiar again. Down to the smallest detail as the memory took place. Then, the cries became apparent again. There she was. Back near the same accursed alleyway, as if she just went around in a circle. But of course, this memory doesn&#39;t take place elsewhere, after all. 

It happened right here.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finally, he made himself known on his own accord this time. He knelt down next to the sobbing silhouette to place a blanket over her. It meant nothing, of course. He wasn&#39;t there so no comfort could be given. James didn&#39;t understand why he did it himself. Perhaps it was his instincts. With that small gesture made, he got up and stood in the middle of the alleyway. If Ann wanted him, she needed to enter the alleyway herself. The atmosphere was thick, as if one had to move through a viscous film to wander through, with a suffocating sense of dread lingering in the air from the trauma she went through. All the disgusting specks that littered the alleyway were more apparent and prominent. The lights flickered and dimmed as they provided little to no comfort or light to the area. Nearby sounds became louder and closer to give no rest to those inside from what could come next. 

&quot;I now understand why I saw so many nightmares regarding this night. I wonder, though. How does this tie into your wish?&quot; 

The longer he spends inside of her mind, the more memories he would find of hers. Nothing of hers was safe anymore. Everything was laid out for James to look through. Every trauma. Every secret. <em>Every moment of weakness.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103422994669379684 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103422994669379684><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 3:49 PM">3:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Seeing the alleyway again and again played tricks on her mind. It made her eyes wetter, her muscles stiffer, her chest heavier... but it only made her anger towards that <s>middle-aged</s> old man stronger. And it kept her moving.

Her head snapped in his direction as he made his presence known inside one of the crying alleys. She didn&#39;t hesitate as she walked up to the alley and took her first step inside, but her body instinctively froze on contact with the oppressive miasma of despair within. But instead of lingering on the scene or her almost lifeless silhouette on the floor, her bloodshot eyes stared at James. The rage helped her stay focused.

She glanced at the cover he had placed over her silhouette and felt her stomach turn again. What the hell was that gesture supposed to mean, that he was sorry this had happened? That he wished he was there so he could’ve done something? Whatever the reason, that affectionate gesture made her want to puke.

&quot;This thing?&quot; She said as she stepped closer to him, her voice breaking a few times. &quot;You and I talking, trying to find something profound to say? Mutual therapy during the pause in the fighting?&quot;

One of the tears she was desperately trying to hold back fell down her cheek as she approached James and reached for his collar, gripping it so tightly her knuckles turned white. She gave him a brief smile, then gritted her teeth in unbridled fury as she brought her head back.

&quot;WE’RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT!&quot;

&quot;GAHH-&quot; The crunch of his nose was the ringing of the bell that started their brawl. Blood ran freely from both nostrils after they recoiled from the blow. His vision blurred and his ears rung from the impact. Both of them were bloodied already, mainly thanks to James. 

There was no time to grab one of his needles. He needed to act <em>now</em>. &quot;Fine! Have it your way!&quot; His hands gripped onto her collar in retaliation. However, instead of a headbutt to repay her back, James lifted his knee to her stomach while attempting to pull her off balance.

Her body was full of openings, as if she didn&#39;t care about her own well-being. Yes, she was a reckless brawler. She was willing to take a beating if it meant that she could hit her opponent...

&quot;Guhh!!&quot; But that meant James&#39; knee collided effortlessly with her stomach, causing her to wince and buckle from the pain. Her stomach was already upset from reliving the painful past, and this additional blow only made the contents inside churn even harder. The vomit rose to the back of her throat and she had to close her mouth and hold her breath to keep herself from vomiting, which also allowed James to easily knock her off balance and make her stumble from her feet.

But she gritted her teeth and pushed through the pain and the taste of vomit in her mouth to keep him firmly in her grasp. When you had a traumatic past like Ann&#39;s, it took that kind of willpower to survive and keep fighting. It&#39;s what allowed her to keep going in this fight, despite the mental scars the memory brought back.

She pulled James by the collar and twisted her body as she fell so that they both fell at the same time. They both fell on their sides and after a brief struggle they rolled and rolled on the dirty floor until Ann was on top of James, her face inches from his, breathing heavily from her nose from exhaustion.

&quot;I&#39;ll have it... my way... all right!&quot; She grabbed both his forearms to stop him from hitting her or moving too much, then brought her head down again in an undignified and wild head-butt to his bloody nose. &quot;Come on, ‘daddy’... is that all you&#39;ve got?!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There wouldn&#39;t be much of a fight if he kept taking direct hits to his head. So, to counter her second attempt at a headbutt, James brought his own forward to clash against hers. This way, the resulting crash would be mitigated somehow as well as split the damage between each other. Though, James was left more worse for wear due to the first one. 

&quot;You&#39;re forgetting one thing, you crazy bitch...&quot; Just as James spoke through bloody gritted teeth, the spot Ann was holding onto heated up until it burned like an element on a stove.

The skin on her palms and fingers painfully peeled and tore like plastic wrap as she clenched her hands into tight fists.

&quot;Fucking... magic...!&quot; She grunted as she pushed herself off him and stood up on her feet, taking a bare knuckle boxing stance with both fists in front of her and her chin tucked in. Waiting for James to get up, Ann then lunged forward with one of her fists cocked back, but as she had done at the start of their fight, her punch faltered and she changed her stance at the last second, twisting her body to...

No, it was a double feint. She made it look like her leg was going up for a kick, when in fact she was stomping on the ground and taking a big step forward to close the gap between her and James, thinking he wouldn&#39;t expect her to come into close quarters with him after burning her hands, before delivering a punch to his side with all the force she could muster.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There wasn&#39;t a single doubt in his mind that his magecraft could be used in a fight. That couldn&#39;t prepare him for the smell that came with it, however. It was a horrible way to inflict pain on another. Something he might have came to regret, if it wasn&#39;t for the rage he felt boiling up inside.

Quickly, he got back on his feet before he brought up his fists and braced himself for her next assault. This time, though, he had a plan for her. &quot;It&#39;s called <em>magecraft</em>!&quot; Once she came in for her attack, James defended with one arm while he casted a simple Reinforcement magecraft on his overshirt to grant him adequate protections against something simple like her fists. His overshirt might as well been stone from the quick reinforcement magecraft made on it. No matter how useful it may seem, the faint enhancement was already fading. 

Before it faded away completely, James took the chance to go on the offensive himself. A few swings were made. While Ann had the experience, James had the advantage of tricks up his sleeve to keep things levelled in this slugfest.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104349282515042314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104349282515042314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 6, 2023 5:09 AM">5:09 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was he wearing steel armour under his clothes or something? No... It was probably another one of his magical antics. And it sucked, because it meant that not only couldn&#39;t she grapple him, but she couldn&#39;t hit his body reliably either. His defences were impenetrable. Fucking Magi.

And that also meant that he could go on the offensive without having to worry about his own safety. Ann quickly buried her face behind her forearms in a tight guard as he began his attack, his fists colliding with Ann&#39;s defences again and again. Her forearms began to burn and bruise from the repeated blows, but at least Ann&#39;s head was safe. That was just pain. Pain she could work with. But a direct hit to the chin would spell immediate death.

She stayed on the defensive for tens of seconds, letting James hit her defences again and again, her body twisting left and right to either dodge or break up the momentum of his blows... but no one could punch forever, and exhaustion would inevitably set in if he kept hammering her with blows like he did. Not only that, but Ann felt... a kind of desperation or rage coming from his hits, which meant he was finally losing his cool to her Mystic Eyes. Good. She used this onslaught as an opportunity to rest a little while he tired himself out in his frenzy, biding her time patiently until the right moment came when she&#39;d return each and every blow he threw at her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She dropped her guard and took a big step forward towards James, cocking a fist that made her hiss loudly in pain. She had taken more damage from the block than she thought, just moving her arms hurt now. That old man didn&#39;t go easy on any of his blows. 

Not the body, he could make it as hard as a rock. Not the arms, he could catch her fist and burn her skin off. The only solution was to go for his bloody face. Ann twisted her body and bent her elbow in a carefully crafted hook to get behind his guard. And the strike was successful...

But it was dangerously lacking in power. The sound her fist made against his cheek was hollow and weak. She should have been able to almost knock him out with one good punch, especially a guy as exhausted as he was. But at that moment, she failed to understand just how exhausted and injured <em>she</em> was. In fact, despite tiring him out, she was breathing almost as hard and as fast as he was. And the power of her blows was suffering as a result.

&quot;Huff... fuck... hufff... ha!&quot; But there was nothing she could do but strike, through the pain and through the exhaustion. So she immediately raised her other fist and, gritting her teeth. She twisted her body in the other direction, putting more force and weight behind her punch than the first. This second hook had more power behind it, but it still wasn&#39;t nearly enough to knock him out. She was running on fumes. Who knew that fighting Magi was so fucking exhausting, both physically and mentally.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That made this moment the perfect opportunity to finish her off. His opponent was weak, tired, and more than likely unable to properly defend herself if he went in for the kill. If only he had the strength left to close the deal right here, of course.

James stumbled back from the blow as he so desperately tried to catch his breath. There was a growing pain inside of his head. One part was from the headbutt. The other came from his continuous use of this strenuous magecraft. The concentration to keep it up was much more difficult during a fight than he initially thought. It was a good attempt though.

&quot;...Alright. Enough of this shit...&quot; James brought up his foot to kick Ann away once she came at him again. The kick wasn&#39;t capable of any meaningful impact. It mainly served to push both of them away from each other once he broke off the mental connection between them.

&quot;Ugh!&quot; James felt his back hit against the frozen door he had to squeeze through as he sat on the ground. The cold air of the department store caused a chill to travel up his spine. That helped him &quot;wake up&quot; in a sense as he took in his surroundings. He was still alive it seemed. Assassin kept the Dragon away. He regrettably wasn&#39;t able to hold up his part of the deal though.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104756151272345630 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104756151272345630><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 7, 2023 8:06 AM">8:06 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was no longer able to move away when he kicked her away, breaking the mental link with Ann. The sobs of her past self dissipated in seconds and the nail-biting cold of the DIY store returned to assault her exposed skin as she snapped back to reality.

Unable to keep her balance from exhaustion, Ann stumbled backwards a few steps until her back slammed into a shelf, almost taking it down with her. She leaned against it for a few seconds, white mist dissipating in front of her face as she regained her shaky breath and stared down at her opponent on the other side of the shop. Her entire body threatened to collapse upon her, yet her eyes still managed to convey a false sense of vitality and health.

&quot;A lot of good... huff... that trip fucking accomplished... huh?&quot;

...but unbeknownst to her, as she stumbled from James&#39; kick, something in her leather vest fell to the floor between them, its colour contrasting sharply with the snow and frost it had fallen on.

A packet of Marlboro Reds.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Besides, look at you. You look like shit because of it...&quot; A classic case of the pot calling the kettle black. James was just as bashed up, if not more, as Ann. Neither of them could say that they walked away from this &#39;winning&#39; so to say.

The fatigue struck James hard once he sat down. His body received the break it needed and now it won&#39;t allow him to get up for a bit until it got what it wanted. If she could find a way to finish him off, it would be perfect. His gaze wasn&#39;t even on her anymore either. It was on the packet of cigarettes that fell from Ann&#39;s jacket. God, he could go for one right now. If only they weren&#39;t in the middle of a fight... You know what? Fuck it. 

James dug into his pocket to pull out his own packet before setting one gently in his mouth. &quot;Listen, you&#39;re a pretty fucked up kid.&quot; Before he continued, James used his magecraft to ignite the end of the cigarette with his fingers with ease. A long drag of it was done as he stared on the smoke from his exhale. &quot;Believe me. I seen it all, or a good majority of it. <em>Even that close-call on that rooftop</em>.&quot; This man really did see everything, huh?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105141354494972007 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105141354494972007><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 8, 2023 9:37 AM">9:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So she kept catching her breath, and seeing that he was in exactly the same situation on the floor, she felt relaxed enough to close her eyelids and rest against the shelf. She was too tired to try and get burned wrestling him anyway. &quot;Huff... you&#39;re not looking any better, old boy. As a matter of fact, you look like dogshit.&quot; Ann was quick to point out his hypocrisy, as if it wasn&#39;t obvious enough that they were both at the end of their wits.

Her chest rose and fell quietly as she took the time to rest, the tense lines on her face smoothing out as if she were peacefully slumbering. His next words, however, put an end to her relaxation as she opened her eyes and stared at him... and not only his words, but the cigarette in his mouth made her pause and think. She was confused for a second, but the next second she understood what was going on. About damn time her eyes caught up with him.

She smirked, slightly amused at the image of her enemy smoking in the cold open. &quot;Shit... I could go for one too.&quot;

She fumbled inside her jacket, hissing softly at the pain still radiating from her palms and fingers, and pulled out her zippo. She also searched for her cigarette pack, cursing when she couldn&#39;t find it, before she looked down at the ground and saw that it had fallen during the scuffle. With another hiss, she picked herself up from the shelf she was leaning on and walked over to it, crouching down to pick it up. Looking down at her hands as she fumbled with the pack, her skin wasn&#39;t burned or peeling, but the pain was still there somehow. So weird.

She put a cigarette between her lips and flicked the lighter to light the tip, but no flame came out. She tried a few more times with the same result. &quot;Shit. Just my fucking luck.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead of a drink, however, when he brought his eyes to focus on his opponent, she was struggling to light her own smoke. There was a part of him that thought she deserved it for the beating she gave him. Another part didn&#39;t allow him to care enough to let something that petty be the reason he just sat by, even if he wanted to.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; A noise to get her attention was made as he held out his hand. Two fingers was being held up, his index and ring finger, to show that his magecraft was still up.

Looks like he could do other things than burn people&#39;s skin off with his magic. How gentlemanly.

She stepped up to him and crouched down to his level, holding her cigarette between her lips as she approached it to his fingers, which set it alight. &quot;Thanks.” Then she straightened her legs and walked beside him, leaning her back against the frozen door of the shop. She took a long drag on her cigarette, letting it linger in her body longer than it needed to. Oh, the sweet release.

&quot;So you&#39;ve seen it all, huh?&quot; Or at least the more gruesome parts, she thought. The ones that could really shake her up during the fight. &quot;Well... that&#39;s embarrassing. I&#39;ve never shared most of what you saw with anyone before. Not even the woman who saved me from that close-call. It&#39;s a first, and just as I thought, it feels like shit to open up. Willingly… or not.&quot;

She stared down at him for a moment, then took another long drag from her cigarette, the rush of nicotine into her system helping to calm her nerves.

&quot;Back then... there were no good days.&quot; She continued a little hesitantly, her features hardening slightly as she reminisced the past for the first time in a long while. &quot;Back then, there were the bad days, and then there were the days I dreaded the bad days. Little has changed since then, except that I don&#39;t dread the bad days anymore.&quot;

She kicked the snow at her feet a few times, thinking back to the dreamscape fight. It seemed like a distant memory now that they were back in the hardware store, smoking cigarettes together instead of going at each other&#39;s throats.

&quot;Say, why did you put a blanket over me in that alley?&quot; She asked, her tone less that of a question than a verbal thought. &quot;And what about your daughter, what&#39;s the deal with her? Is she dead or something?&quot; Zero tact.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not the healthiest lifestyle but then again attending a Grail War isn&#39;t the most healthy choice one can make for one&#39;s life. 

His hand rested on his lap after he helped her out with lighting her smoke. Her eyes worn him down until his inhibitions were no more. This revealed a man who was just tired. A man who probably never sat down just to rest for years until now.

Just so he isn&#39;t straining his eyes, and so he doesn&#39;t activate them once again, James placed his shades back on and allowed the nicotine to flow through his system with each drag. &quot;Yeah...I did.&quot; There was little he didn&#39;t see. Honestly it still made him sick to his stomach how cruel some people can be. But, as he knows well enough himself, Life is hardly anything but cruel.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for all that. Invading someone&#39;s most private secrets doesn&#39;t sit well with me. However, it&#39;s kill or be killed here. You got to do what you can to make sure you don&#39;t fuck up.&quot; One wouldn&#39;t call the place they are in the most comfortable to relax in but, for James, it was.

When the topic switched over to his daughter, there was a moment of hesitation as words failed to leave his mouth at first. &quot;She isn&#39;t dead. If I don&#39;t find a cure for whatever making her sick she will be though. She can&#39;t leave her bed and at best she has a few months left.&quot; James brought up his hand to look at his command seals made into the shape of a butterfly with diamond-shaped wings. &quot;If the Grail can truly grant wishes then that&#39;s the best shot I have.&quot;

His hand fell to rest on his lap again before he got up, with a hard groan, so he stood up with her. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like it matters if I die in this Grail War or not because, well...&quot; James reached up to flick the well-used cigarette away from mouth into snow so he can start on another one. &quot;Let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t see myself living any longer than she does.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105295261917524062 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105295261917524062><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 8, 2023 7:48 PM">7:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But it wasn&#39;t as if she didn&#39;t understand where he was coming from. She had been there once.

&quot;I&#39;ll be honest, if you can&#39;t win against a commoner like me...&quot; She took another cigarette from her pack and handed it to him without looking, smiling wickedly to herself. &quot;...then you might as well kill yourself now and be done with it. It&#39;ll save you a lot of time and make me very happy. It&#39;s a win-win situation.&quot;

As he lit her cigarette, she put it between her lips and crossed her arms in contemplation, looking straight ahead. His indignant reaction to her wish made more sense in this context. He was putting his life on the line, fighting tooth and nail to save his daughter from an unjust faith. Ann, on the other hand, had done little more than stumble into this war to satisfy her own selfishness. And Ann&#39;s wish truly paled in comparison, seemingly fickle and unimportant, though strangely she didn&#39;t think it was either.

She stepped away from the sliding doors they were both leaning against with a slight hiss and took a few steps into the shop, crouching down to pick up her Wondergirl bat from the floor. She looked back at him briefly, inhaling into her cigarette before expelling the smoke through her words.

&quot;You know... if someone close to me had a limited amount of time, I wouldn&#39;t fight it. I&#39;d help them have as much fun as possible, and I&#39;d help them do all the things they wished they could have done before they died.

It was a small act that didn&#39;t demand more from him, or from her in return, so he didn&#39;t mind. 

&quot;Well, same goes for you. If you had this much trouble against someone as old as I am, then I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have to worry about running into you a second time.&quot; A soft cough, muffled of course, came from James  as the price for smoking one after the other crept up on him. 

No moves were made to stop her from picking up her bat. No Magecraft. No weapon of his own being tossed her way. James did, however, continue to stand in between Ann and the way out. Just like with her retrieving her bat, James made no attempt to stand aside in the slightest.

&quot;You see, that is where we differ from each other.&quot; Even with the pains and aches on his body, James straightened his posture somewhat. &quot;The last thing I would want to do is to just give up when there is still something I can do for them. You may be willing to accept and let someone close to you, like that Kathleen girl, die, but not me.&quot; After those words, James reached behind him to pull out Assassin&#39;s knife that she threw. Slowly, it began to glow with intense heat. &quot;If I was willing to just give in like that, I wouldn&#39;t have came here to begin with.&quot; Their little break was over. It was time to find out which one of them will be walking out of here alive.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105742101477605397 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105742101477605397><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 10, 2023 1:24 AM">1:24 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With the adrenaline gone, she was now aware of every little pain and every little wound he had inflicted on her. It hurt like hell whenever she moved, and she wanted nothing more than to just lie still and recover a little longer.

But their smoke break was at its end. A shame. She could&#39;ve went for a third.

&quot;...I guess you wouldn&#39;t, yeah. That&#39;s fair.&quot; Ann acknowledged his words, tucking her bat into her armpit as she fumbled for something in the inside pockets of her jacket. &quot;Frankly, I&#39;m not the type to go against the flow. Making the best of a shitty situation, that&#39;s how I learned to deal with life as a kid. You wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;

She took out of her jacket a rectangular piece of yellowish paper that looked rather old. A talisman, to be precise. She dabbed her thumb on the barbed wire around her bat and drew blood, which she used to write on the talisman.

&#39;Stubborn old daddy&#39;.

&quot;One last thing.&quot; She tossed the talisman behind her, which spontaneously caught fire, and took a last drag on her cigarette before sticking out her tongue in disgust, the cigarette butt falling to the floor. &quot;Don&#39;t fucking apologize to me for my past. That&#39;s all.&quot;

She stared hard at the knife James was heating, and assumed her fighting stance, as if to say &#39;whenever you&#39;re ready&#39;.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The first being what she was doing with her eyes. Although she called herself a commoner, he doubted that she was burning those up for superstition alone. That was more his field anyways. Whatever it was, should be something he should handle. 

&quot;A bit too late for a luck charm there. You should have used one of those at the start alongside those Eyes of yours.&quot; From the start he knew there was something with her eyes. The Qi points he saw at the first were more predominantly focused near her eyes after all. 

Then, without waiting for much of a response from her, James ran at her, knife in hand, ready to plunge it into her and end their fight.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105800370485219338 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105800370485219338><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 10, 2023 5:15 AM">5:15 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Magi were no joke, Ann thought, as he lunged at her like a madman with his flaming hot knife. But instead of defending herself, Ann shifted the handle of her bat and took it in one hand.

&quot;Bzzzt. It&#39;s not just any luck charm.&quot; Without hesitation, she struck the fingers of her other hand, a little too hard, which mirrored the one James used to grip the knife. Not enough to break them, but certainly enough to render her hand weak and useless for the rest of the fight. Her knuckles swelled and bruised, and she hoped the same would happen to <em>him</em> now.

Without waiting to see if it had worked, Ann also struck one of her knees with the bat, causing her leg to buckle and press weakly against the floor. Leaning against a shelf helped her keep her balance, but she hoped that James, who was still running, wouldn&#39;t benefit from the same situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So, with a loud sizzle once it hit the snow, the knife fell onto the ground, melting the snowy texture before. 

Next came the knee strike. There wasn&#39;t enough time to prepare himself so James fell onto the ground before he could make it to Ann. They were both grounded due to the blow to the knee that was mirrored between them. 

&quot;So that&#39;s how it is... Some &#39;commoner&#39; you are, huh?&quot; James used the shelf to support himself so he could stand up. He gritted his teeth in pain from purposely putting weight on the wounded leg to see if the pressure would translate over as well.

One small plus in a sea of minuses.

But that excitement was tempered by more pain coming to her knee as James used his injured one to prop himself up. The pressure transferred, pinning her to the shelf she was currently using for balance because of the pain. 

They were at a standstill, the two of them glaring at each other. If the outcome had been unclear before, it became even more so now that their bodies were linked to the same fate. But one thing was certain: <em>neither of them would give up easily.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>
