An excavation site headed by the curator of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo has suffered a break in as of three hours ago, and relics have been stolen en route to Cairo.

Egypt did have a problem with artifacts disappearing, they should look into that. If they lost a piece of history, finding a duplicate was often impossible. History rhymed, but it did not repeat. 

Especially when that piece of history was the artifact of a god.

‘A scale believed to represent the god Anubis’? Illyn chuckled to himself as he looked at the summoning circle beneath his mango tree. “I suppose that if I were in their shoes, I’d say the same.”

Atlas had a stockpile of artifacts belonging to Egyptian deities. Unfortunately, Illyn would not return there alone. Pride would not allow it. It would be as if confessing that he was incapable of bringing his wife back. When a genius left Atlas, they were expected to return. It was <em>predicted</em>. It was an absolute value that could not be denied. Illyn could respect that.

Yet he would sooner throw himself into IBM then return there empty handed, even to borrow a catalyst.

Illyn’s thoughts returned to the catalyst before him. It was wrapped in black cloth, yet it was clear that it was some sort of scale. However, it could be considered a scale just as one could consider a gun a bow and arrow. It was foreign. There was no chain weighing the two sides of the scale. It remained perfectly balanced out.

In short, it was the catalyst for a god. A relic that would bring forth the Egyptian God of Death, Anubis. After he was done with it, he would return it to the museum. He needed it now, though.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091067480383946844 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091067480383946844><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 1:32 PM">1:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The summoning was to take place in her garden. His wife had loved gardening, and when the two had been engaged, they had planted a mango tree in the center of the circular space. Now, the tree bore fruit. Fireflies danced in the light, and flowers bloomed from every orifice. This was a terrible place to perform a summoning, as magical energy could run freely. Nonetheless, Illyn’s home was connected to a leyline. It would provide the required magical energy, and hopefully it would be enough.

His wife… He could barely remember her. It was like his mind was fraying, like his memory was shifting like the sands of the desert. Yet he knew he had to bring her back to life.

If there was one being that could bring her back, it would be Anubis. Illyn didn’t care if Anubis took his body as payment. It would be a temporary setback, but he would pay the price nonetheless.

Illyn stepped through flowers and gurgling streams as he stood in the center of the summoning circle made from the blood of the missing driver. Illyn disliked killing, but he made a special place for drivers. Especially distracted ones. Ever since she… “Stop.” Illyn told himself and nobody. The driver had tried to shoot him, but Illyn had stopped him with a spell and taken the gun for himself. It was now scanned and deposited into IBM for future reference.

The summoning circle was forged from blood mass-produced from IBM, using the driver’s blood as a base. An absolutely perfect circle, made by hand. If Illyn was good at one thing, it was spatial thinking and application. If he wasn’t capable of making a perfect summoning circle, he would have been laughed out of Atlas.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091067564332941532 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091067564332941532><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 1:32 PM">1:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Illyn placed the catalyst in the center of the circle. 

He took a deep breath.

“<strong>Let blood and steel be the essence.</strong>”

“<strong>Let the sands of time be the foundation upon which nothing is built. Let the universe’s unpredictability become null before absolution.</strong>”

“<strong>Let the blackness of my soul be the offering. Let every soul I have be the tribute required. Let the Six Sources of Atlas hear my proclamation! I laugh at fate! I laugh at chance! I laugh at destiny.</strong>”

In Illyn’s pocket, IBM’s screen activated and began to blink rapidly.

“<strong>If you hear the Grail’s call, and obey my will and reason. Answer me! Let us turn the wheel of time until its spokes crack and bend!</strong>”

 <em>I have no need for a Grail. No need for anything but your power. Please…</em>

“<strong>APPEAR, GUARDIAN OF THE SCALES!</strong>”

“<em><strong>Bring her back to me. I’ll do anything.</strong></em>”

Fireflies fluttered in the night sky like stars, only to cast light on depravity below.

The circle erupted into light.

In the circle, there was no figure, at least, not that he could see. Rather, there was nothing there at all. Many masters would have felt the crushing feeling of doubt, failure often swaddling up those with weak wills, as nothing seemed to answer him back, no response towards his call to the throne, not even a polite voicemail. Simply the silence of the Bernice winds that went about and the now visible meek lights of the fireflies that had occupied the widower’s trees. That was, until a rustle was heard.

“You really know how to welcome someone. Are these your mangoes that I’m able to chew on? They’re pretty sweet.”

The voice had a base to it, one where each word no matter the accent pronounced it yet it no matter how deep it went, it could coax even the easiest of hermits from their homes. Could sell even to swindlers. Soon, a pair of feet would dangle from above, followed by pristine white clothing, and finally a face. So someone <em>did</em> answer his calls. The stranger waited a moment, just to allow the take in a breath to see who this was, as sure as hell was no jackal. There was no Ankh, no pointed ears, or fabled face of secrets. All there was, was mundane mortal features, something that he knew could not have been right, no, this bastard had nothing close to godliness and yet he held his grace as someone who could have somehow been from somewhere just as important. But did it matter if he had such a presence? He had spoken about his wife.

Now, he was face to face with him. The stranger moved first, his smile revealing bits of the fruit’s rind in his teeth as he inspected the man before him, and for Illyn, this was the perfect time to get some sort of hint as to who or . . . what he was. The messy black curls around his head seemed kempt and untouched, their brown eyes seemed to peer at him and yet somehow through him, and the emerald green jewelry he wore could easily signify he was some sort of royalty, but from where. . . And for his question, what exactly did the end signify? 

“Well, do you have an answer?”

Not many would be able to understand such a thing. The end could have meant anything. The ending to a book, the ending to a movie, the ending to a life, the ending to a lifetime. For all the man could know, there were thousands of ways one could have interpreted it! But, the figure stayed patient, or well, patient as he could have been, his smile still plastered on his gentle features as he awaited an answer. Any answer could have sufficed, it was just a matter of had he heard of it or not. But, sadly, that remained again the issue of the master, <strong>what would that end be?</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091071499592544378 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091071499592544378><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 1:48 PM">1:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was not Anubis. This was no Caster, and judging from his mannerisms, this was certainly no Berserker.

Everything that had gone wrong had occurred. Every single thing that had led to this moment was for nothing. He had driven for hours to get the catalyst for Anubis. He had ended the life of a driver for this ritual. He had used all of the knowledge he had gleaned at Atlas for this ritual. It should have been <strong>perfect.</strong>

But it was not.

Atlas developed weapons. What were Heroic Spirits but weapons? As a result, Illyn had felt confident as he had prepared the ritual. He went over everything from the preparation to the catalyst to the incantation to the ritual itself. Nothing stuck out. The magecraft was as flawless as the original summoning performed almost two hundred years ago in the city of Fuyuki.

It was perfect.

So for the first time in almost a decade since she had died, Illyn let his emotions bubble up.

“<strong>What…!</strong>” Illyn’s face twisted into an expression of absolute contempt and rage. “You are not Anubis, God of the Underworld. Yet you must be a god. A ritual of that quality could only produce the highest of results, and yet…”

Illyn grabbed his face. Random chance. It was always random chance. First his engagement, then his marriage, then his wife, then that car, then this… It all fell down to luck. When she had crossed that street… No, he would not think of that. He couldn’t remember her face. Her name was [       ], she liked pancakes and ancient pyramids, her favorite color was [     ].

His name was Illyn. His favorite food was mango sorbet with whiskey. He was an alchemist of Atlas. He had [    ]. As he went through the motions, Illyn’s emotions composed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091145525291659375 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091145525291659375><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 6:42 PM">6:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“<strong>You were not what I wanted.</strong>” He finally said, responding to the being’s relaxing tones. His shoulders relaxed slightly, yet Illyn’s expression was alarming. “And yet, if you can help me in my quest, you will do. I have heard of the end. I wish to break it apart and smash it.”

To Illyn, the end was a dozen different things. His end was ten years ago. Random chance was the end. Death was the end. If it was <em>absolute</em>, then it was the end. Unpredictability was the end of everything, from the greatest of plans to the smallest of lives. On a cosmic scale, it was insignificant.

Yet to Illyn, it was everything. 

“Death is the end. Unpredictability is the end. I’ve heard of both, and I have <em>suffered</em> from both. If you aren’t Anubis, then I request your True Name and Class.”

Jeez, did he already strike a nerve from just being there? Well, the throne did not exactly do “refunds” from what he could have remembered from it. Once a servant was summoned, it was pretty much stuck there less it died. There was not much other than that. The servant’s head shake to the assumption of god-hood had been something that only seemed to pile on the disappointment.

“Godhood? Not exactly. . . I’ve yet to be called a god yet, so, I can&#39;t say for sure that I am one. . . But, I can see you would not like that answer, to remedy this, I can say that I am <em>close</em> to a god, in fact, a reincarnation of one.”

His face tried to counteract the scowl that had once been on Illyn’s, his eyes a closed and warming look as he hoped that would remedy such a distraught feeling that his new master could be feeling. The Reincarnation of a god? That had to account for something. For a moment, the man was silent, leading his servant to think he was pondering over the information, curious as to how he could have fixed such a grave mistake. The servant was going to say something once again to try to comfort the man, but found his questions answered instead. His smile kept his face almost still, passive almost, ah, so that is what he thought the end was. 

“Well, you are correct and incorrect, New Master. The end is not always death, nor is it just unpredictability. You see . . . The end is but a cycle, the end can be life, the end can be death too. It can be certain as well. That is what I am for. You ask for my True Name and Class? Hopefully this shines light on your opinion. I am Sri Kalki, the Turner of the Wheel, the man who will end this cycle of the world. The last incarnation of Vishnu. Rider.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turned around and reached to grab a mango that was hanging ignorantly in his path, taking another sweet bite of it as he observed the area about him, a place full of trees, and yet, clearly there had to have been something more to it. . . To ask for the God of Death, then, clearly while the place was lively, Kalki could tell that there was a sickly sweet strength of death. The mango tasted mushy, the sugary taste of it overpowering his attention, he forced a swallow before he spoke again.

“Well Master, I hope you are happy. . . While I cannot say I could do what that Egyptian god can do, I surely have things that could assist you in your goal, as long as you help with mine.

Illyn simply mouthed the same silently as he worked his way through the implications of the Servant before him. Not <strong>the</strong> Servant, he corrected. <strong>His</strong> Servant. Illyn looked at his hand, where his Command Seal had been burned. It resembled a moebius strip more than a traditional engraving. Nonetheless, it only had three uses.

His discussion with Sister Rosula flashed back into Illyn’s mind. Then, he had told her that he would execute his Servant without a second thought, should it be incapable of fulfilling his wishes. He had meant it then, and now was as good a time as any to commit to that vow. 

As if reacting to Illyn’s thoughts, the Command Seal glowed dully and began to throb. In that moment, Illyn was certain of one thing: <strong>Kalki would die</strong>. All it would take was a whispered word, and Vishnu’s avatar would die in the dirt alongside the pulps of mangos.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091168526515044352 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091168526515044352><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 8:14 PM">8:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>No.</em> Illyn lowered his hand as he glanced at his Servant. This was a tool. A tool with the capacity to still fulfill his goals. He was an Alchemist of Atlas, and would not be so foolhardy with weapons that he could barely control.

“Yet.” Illyn empathized in response to Rider’s proclamation of godhood. “So you are a Heroic Spirit from the future? Yet that cannot be correct. You must exist in a book or legend, somewhere.” If Kalki was a Heroic Spirit from beyond today, then Illyn’s summoning was far more spectacular than even he could’ve anticipated. “Do you know how you were summoned? I specifically used a scale belonging to Anubis. A misfire of this magnitude should be impossible.” 

Should?

How would he know? Illyn had never summoned a Servant. Such an accomplishment had only occurred a handful of times. There was always more knowledge to discover. That was the one absolute rule of the world. There was always <em>something</em> to chase after.

Illyn’s sigh echoed through the garden as he considered Kalki’s statement even more. An avatar of Vishnu could be extremely valuable. “Fine.” Illyn’s monotone voice rang with the sound of defeat. “Come inside. Pick some mangos and recover that scale. Don’t break it.”

Illyn retreated inside to the solar, and took a seat. He held his head in his hands.

However, even he could see that while there was not as much a look of disappointment, there was something else on his mind. He just did not know what.

Questioning what thoughts his strange master could be pondering was a luxury he currently did not have time for. Rather strange enough, something on his arm burned red, a light and symbol so strange that the Incarnation could not help but be enamored with it. The scarlet heat almost visceral. Something in him felt the urge to listen, take heed, and yet no voice came to give him an order. Silence ensued for another moment, and soon enough the light died down, reverting back to the normal pale hand that it occupied. Kalki simply waited, hoping that his master would elaborate on what just that was, but instead, he had been asked about his summoning conditions.

“Yet.”

Kalki mimicked back, only confirming what he had said before. He was sure that he said it clearly, even more certain that his master had the correct idea, it was just now a matter of time before he could figure it out. The Indian servant put a hand to his chin, closed his eyes and nodded as he heard about hypotheses that Illyn went on about, musing himself along the thought process.

“Well, you see, I <em>am</em> a servant from the future, and yet I am also from the past too. . . Sri Kalki is but a future premonition that our gods had and that people would foresee in the future’s end times. They’ve even written out a whole scripture for me in the puranas. . . So, while I haven’t exactly been “born” yet into the world’s final moments of the Kali Yuga, I guess you can say that because it is the end, that I am here too. As for <em>why</em> I was able to answer your calls, I guess you can call it a servant’s intuition.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091182509674475520 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091182509674475520><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 9:09 PM">9:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Before Illyn could ask him to elaborate, Kalki tilted his head towards the sky, a blank and clear time for them all to witness, and yet Kalki seemed to almost be comfortable with it. A draft of wind caught his clothes and in a way, made them billow with him, as if just enough force and he’d be blown away like the many Egyptian sand dunes. In that moment, he looked most human, not even a servant, but rather like he could have hailed as a stranger, a friend, a brother. The wind calmed itself down eventually, and thus his calm and billowed look came to cease, and with a tone as if he wouldn&#39;t have said the most outrageous thing, would be the final thing he would remark on such a topic. 

“You see, this is the end. . . and I have been prompted by our good preserver god, Vishnu, to go and spread the world of him to get those who are prepared for the end and to get ready for the next cycle of the world. Specifically, Mahapralaya, The Dissolution of the Universe. And then, to get them ready for the beginning once again. Satya Yuga. I am sure Anubis did not mind that I took his place, as from what I see, the scales won&#39;t be needed in the first part of the cycle anyways.”

Once again, he seemed calm to say such! But what would the master think? He of course assumed that explaining what he was, would help, but that&#39;s all it was. An assumption. The man turned back and began to walk away, prompting the servant with his first order of picking up fruit and the scale, which Kalki had planned on doing anyway. Whoever had grown those mangoes had perfect gardening skills, they were perfectly plump and juicy enough to just eat by themselves. After filling his pockets with two of the fresh yellow fruit, and grabbing the failure of the scale, he went into the solarium, just to see that still, his master slumped in his chair. An assumption.

My name is Illyn. You are not to say my name during combat. I’m well known in certain circles.” The words were short and clipped as thoughts rushed through Illyn’s mind. He was well known in certain circles, certainly. The Clock Tower was certainly aware of him, and despised him enough that they had not removed him from the Seal Designation list. That list was now so short that it threatened to encroach on the single digits.

Still, Illyn processed Rider’s information as a computer would. Information flashed through his mind as he pondered the implications of this. The end of the world? It was a novel idea, but Illyn did not care if the world ended. It had ended for him years ago.

“I see.” In a tone that didn’t hint at Illyn’s intentions. He took Rider’s proclamations in stride as he reached out for one of the mangos Rider had obtained from the garden. Illyn took a bite of the fruit. It tasted well enough, but every time <strong>it</strong> happened, these mangoes tasted worse and worse. 

Eventually, they would taste like sawdust.

“I don’t care what Anubis would have thought.” Illyn said simply as he put down his mango. “I wanted Anubis’s power to bring the dead back to life. You are not him. My summoning has been hijacked by a Heroic Spirit whose basis on existence is based on a prophecy that has yet to come to pass!” 

Illyn took a deep breath. He breathed in. He breathed out.

“Are you capable of filling in the shoes I carefully laid out for Anubis? If this cycle you propose exists, is it capable of bringing the world back to a point prior, as the wheel turns?” Illyn’s expression was hungry, yet his mango remained partially unconsumed.

That was definitely something he did not expect. To think that the time he was summoned would be close to a new millennium, Kalki nodded his head. That was interesting. Maybe, he was perfectly timed for this. Maybe this was a good moment to have been present after all. As for his master’s name, Illyn had a strange ring to it. Foreboding like the beginning of it. Kalki took heed of his request. He would not call upon his master’s true name in battle, as it seemed almost similar to a servant, revealing their name would easily put them in danger. 

“Understood, I would hope that that is something we can both agree on then, Master. I assume you’d know that saying a servant’s True Name, especially your own, could put you in a very precarious position.”

Luckily for Illyn, even if he hadn’t summoned a servant much before, his current one would remind him of the basic rules of maintaining one. Privacy. Something that was crucial to living in this holy grail war, and something that could easily end a life if not held close. Once his master had taken a mango, Kalki grabbed the other, happy to have the last one for the time being, and chewed on it as he allowed for Illyn to process what was going on. It has a lot of information after all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091183313844195438 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091183313844195438><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 9:12 PM">9:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Kalki wouldn’t say anything to the man either as he went on his furious tirade about the situation at hand either, rather, without trying to feel guilty, he simply stayed silent, allowing the man to feel such a feeling. He had failed, yes, but to say that there was a prophecy yet to pass. . . Could he have been so sure? And to have tried to summon a god themselves, and hoped they’d bend to someone else’s will, was he that determined to have summoned Anubis? Clearly he was ignorant of how gods operated. They moved on <em>their</em> time, not someone else&#39;s. But that was something he knew not many learned of, rather because he knew that the time past the Satya Yuga, where mystery would have been quite copious and all present, was gone. He could feel it. 

His tirade ended in something entirely different, after a good obstructive silence between the two from Illyn’s outburst, Kalki had raised a brow to see what he could have meant by having filled the shoes of his unresponsive first choice. The Rider tried his best to not shake his head, some people simply needed to get through this, some needed to simply be delusional, as long as it helped them understand that there was an end to the world of course. That was something Vishnu had told him before. Instead, the prophesying servant simply nodded, hoping that would keep him at ease. 

“Of course, Master. The wheel is endlessly turning, and it resets on its own time, but I am as sure as my name is also the Turner of the Wheel, that we can make it go through its final phase before the first.

Kalki was safer than Illyn was, as a Servant from the future with little chance of being recognized. Illyn was on the top of the Clock Tower’s kill list in a competition with magi. If one was to get recognized, it would be Illyn, not Rider.

He mulled this over. If the wheel could be turned, it would be. If there was a cycle, then that meant that every single event was meant to occur as the wheel turned. Illyn refused to ponder it any further. To do so would be to accept that his logic was built on sand. A god could not understand the emotions of a human, so Illyn would stay silent, just as Kalki had.

A contract built on silence and delusion would eventually self-destruct, but Illyn had no qualms about tossing Rider aside like trash if needed. He had no need for a Messiah.

“Very well. You’ve made your point.” Illyn stood up sharply. “We have little time to waste then, Rider. We have to return this catalyst that you so thoughtlessly discarded. You also need to familiarize yourself with Benerice’s ley lines and layout. We will formulate a strategy to give this wheel a little push.” 

<em>And see if we can break its spokes.</em> Illyn thought to himself. He thought of that instead of anything else.  He elected to decide that Rider’s proclamation about ending the cycle meant that the war had to be ended for the wheel to turn anew.

In other words, a Holy Grail.

He did not need such a trinket. He simply needed his Servant.

“We will drive. It’ll take three hours to reach Cairo.” Illyn pointed at the scales, then towards the front of the house. Kalki felt the image of a sleek black car pop into his head. <strong>A destination.</strong> Illyn walked out of the solar.

His master had made a great deal of this, so he felt it was best to keep it safe guarded.

“Understood, hopefully this trip will have enough to tell me more about this time. . . If the end is near, clearly there has to be something wrong. . . So, whatever knowledge I can get on this place, the easier it is to help us both.”

Kalki tried to say it as calmly as possible, not wanting to raise any emotions in the man as he began to move in his direction, though as they would leave the solar, Kalki took a good look at the solar where the man lived, trying to figure at least see if maybe he could get a glimpse of how his master had been. Maybe his home could give a hint towards his personality. 

“A three hour drive. . . To think you had been so proactive in getting these scales, I will definitely try to make this trip you made a good one then. While I definitely do not use other things often, would you prefer for me to try and take the wheel? I assure you we can get there safely. . . hopefully.”

He tried to joke, wishing that it could lighten the atmosphere, but it was like praying to a spiteful god. He knew there would likely be little response.

It is like dropping a piaster and finding a pound.” Illyn agreed as he mused over Rider’s remarks. “Correct. I believe it will be valuable information for you. I could explain the topography myself, but seeing is better than hearing.”

As Kalki peered into Illyn’s home, it seemed sparsely decorated and minimalistic, yet organized. It was entirely different from the garden Kalki had found himself in—a chaotic garden that seemed bursting with life. It was a twisted dichotomy. 

Most Masters would balk at the notion of a Heroic Spirit from ancient times driving a car. Illyn was unpreturbed by the idea. Riders rode things for a reason. It would be like giving a Lancer a wooden stick and being surprised that it was incapable of using it as a makeshift weapon. If anything, he expected Rider to be a better driver than himself. He loathed vehicles.

“Very well, you can drive.” Illyn said to the surprise of his Servant. Was that tone in his voice… <em>respect</em>? It was not a respect out of kindness, but a respect out of someone acknowledging someone’s skills. Illyn was a savant in his field. If Kalki was an excellent driver, Illyn would recognize him as another savant in this particular field.

Atlas alchemists were curious creatures. Illyn sat in the passenger’s seat and produced a map from the glovebox.

“We’ll have to turn onto the Alexandria-Cairo Highway eventually. The roads in this country are terrible.” Illyn tapped a spot on the map. “Here.”

Unlike Illyn’s “polished” nature, his outburst definitely could have been compared to the garden itself. Untouched, uncleaned, muddied with the now overripe fruit that could also make it beautiful. To think he’d even get a chance to show off his skill as a rider that wasn’t his horse. . . A win is a win! The incarnation took it as he could and walked to the driver’s seat, something he hadn&#39;t been used to at all, and yet, with how he had fished the keys out and started the engine, one would not be able to tell at all. 

From then on, it was nothing but smooth driving. Occasionally revving the engine enough to showcase his skill behind the wheel, Illyn would have to see how well the rider performed in the task given, and given how he had muttered small words under his breath when a car cut him from the lane, or when a car had not used the correct turn signal. . . it could easily be mistaken as someone who had grown up in this time period. 

“So, Illyn. . . Is there anything exceptional you <em>could</em> tell me about this place? There must be something interesting of this place you call Bernice. . . From this point of Egypt, I thought I could at least see the pyramids, but I have yet to see one. India has plenty of things, not pyramids of course, but that doesn&#39;t matter when we have much lore and culture to share with the world. But this side of Egypt seems barely like a spectacle.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091184919704776745 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091184919704776745><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 9:19 PM">9:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His attempt at travel conversation was helpful to him at least, it kept the servant ready to listen for anything important, but also had him trying to keep the man talking, curious what could have been on his mind to have him so curt with him. He switched to another lane purposefully, only turning to grasp a quick glance at Illyn beside him in the car, by faking that there could have been any cars behind or beside him. What could have he had wanted with Anubis’ authority of death? What could have kept 

“I take it you’ve been here for a while no? What do you have to say about your country’s lack of excitement, besides their shoddy highway infrastructure.”

Had this sort of attempt of conversation been something he could attempt, then clearly the two would be in this car for a while, but, even if they were stuck, the rider planned on making it seem somewhat enjoyable, be it for himself or for the both of them.
