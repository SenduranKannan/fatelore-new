The apartment was shabby, there was not much luxury but it was quite clean regardless which in her experience was something quite rare so it was a nice experience. Still a warm shower was what she needed after being in the cold for so long. She could warm herself with her flames but it wasn&#39;t magical solution and the cold still got to her. 

&quot;Should have taken that red coat instead....&quot; she said as she began to  dry herself inside the bathroom before leaving with the small bathroom with a towel wrapped around her body and another wrapped on her head drying her red head. Normally her fangs covered one of her eyes but as it was tied up with a the tower Saber would see she had small mark on her other eye. It was a bit of discoloration hard to tell if it was an old wound or just a skin mark. 

&quot;Sorry I leave you on your own for a while I needed to warm myself up&quot; she said as she reached into her luggage and recovered a brown bottle. The way back from the summoning place had been quite uneventful her only order for Saber so far had been to keep an eye for possible enemies as cheap shots were more than a real danger. Why fight when you can take other down with less effort? She was sure there was more than a few participants who would think that. 

She open the lid and took a drink as she shiver a bit at the brown liquid went inside her throat. It tasted like hell but it  help warming her up and with any luck it reduced any chances of her getting a sore throat or anything. 

&quot;Oh want a sip?&quot; she said as she offered the bottle to Saber as she seat down on the bed with her legs crossed. &quot; So help me understand a bit better the situation. I learn a bit from this&quot; she add as she show him the book Ritcher had given her.  &quot;But I hadn&#39;t get the chance to fully read it, besides I guess asking you will make things go faster.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He is pretty relaxed, their way to the apartment was clean of malice; potential attackers. If there were any, he would know right away as it is only natural for him to do so. Speaking of natural, Saber has never been in a chamber this small. Closest thing to this that he could remember was when he was sleeping in a house of a... good acquaintance of his, but even that was bigger than this. In a way, it kind of feels claustrophobic for him even if there&#39;s definitely enough room to move around. Eh, whatever, he thought to himself.

Saber stares blankly into space thinking about his home. Perhaps, he is just a little homesick as it has been a long time since he last saw it and felt the interior. No need to worry, from here he can totally see its current state right now. Hmm, how strange. It seems like no one really lives there anymore, only the faces of commoners is all he could &quot;see&quot;. Saber wishes he could go there some day. Oh, It looks like missy is done with her stuff.

Saber&#39;s attention is now on his master. He took a look and couldn&#39;t help but fixate his gaze on the little imperfection on her other eye, Saber wonders if she was born with it or got it from a traumatic injury. He made sure to look away the moment she directed her attention onto him, he knows better than to focus too much on the stains on people&#39;s appearances. Is that alcohol? Where is this kid&#39;s parents?

&quot;Oh uh, I&#39;ll pass&quot;, Saber refuses her offer of a drink. Being handed a book of some sort, he rapidly flipped through the pages... didn&#39;t seem like he even read it at all. &quot;I see, I see. Very well, I will answer any question you have.&quot;

Though he was bothered by the absence of his master&#39;s parents, he can ask that at another time. Like before, Saber knows it is unwise to ask a personal question like that in this atmosphere.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well you don&#39;t look like the drinking type so I guess this was expected.&quot;  She had decided to not judge Saber&#39;s appearance too much and just slowly learn things over through this war. Still it seems like some things were just as they seemed.

&quot;Well mostly wanna understand what you servant are&quot; she said as she reached for the book and began to flip through the notes as she began to question Saber. While some of her questions seemed to have obvious answers she needed to be sure of what she was getting into. Risk was one thing, going blindly was another. She was getting a better understanding of what a servant was an how their way of fighting could be impacted by each other. 

&quot;Well more of my doubts had been answered...&quot; she said as she flipped the page. &quot;Wait you guys can turn into spiritual form? Why you asked to get stuff then?&quot;  she asked a bit confused as she moved forward making the towel on her hair fell down. 

&quot;Oh may as well get dressed.&quot;  she said as she stood from the bed and walk to her luggage to pick some clother. &quot;Oh dont mind me and just answer me while I change&quot; 

Before she may have some issues with Saber being in the same room as she change but the guy was composed enough while they were talking and she was used to other people sometimes entering while she changed due to how chaotic was her house back in Peru so as long as he didn&#39;t stare at her or anything she didn&#39;t mind. 

It also helped learning more about servants, while she still saw them somewhat human. Knowing the extend of their abilities and how superhumans this could be make her distance the two concepts in her mind. To her this wasn&#39;t that much different from changing in front of a dog or a small kid.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of course he can&#39;t answer every single one, but Saber is very much capable of giving at least the fundamentals. Clearing his throat, he began to answer.

&quot;Well Servants are familiars that serve under a Master for the primary purpose of winning the Grail for them.
—Simple concept, really.&quot;

There is more to it, but Saber chose to oversimplify it since the main idea is easy to grasp anyways. If there are any blanks, they can and will be filled by the Master&#39;s own interpretation of a Servant. For Saber, he simply wishes to win the Grail for his master and perhaps himself too.

&quot;As for why I did not take a spirit form... I simply felt like feeling the wind on my skin&quot;, Saber said. Subtly hinting that he has a reason not to take that shape. That reason would appear itself when it wills itself to do. For now, Saber wishes not to concern his master with that.

&quot;And for the &#39;stuff&#39; part, well...&quot; Saber gestured attention towards his sword. &quot;I don&#39;t have anything to secure this to my body,&quot;

Well, that&#39;s all he has to say... <em>needs</em> to say actually. Pretty shallow explanations, but Saber does not really have a good reason to go into deeper thought for these kinds of questions. If Gloria wants to get more information out of him, she&#39;s going to have to ask more specific questions.

&quot;Anything else, Master? Once you get the answers you want, I have something for you&quot;, Saber said as he stood straight and stretched out a bit. Just some thoughts that need some feedback.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just be careful when you sneak up tomorrow when we leave. We don&#39;t know where who may be looking around.&quot; Gloria decided to just take his answer at face value as she understood that pause by his tone. He was hiding something, she didn&#39;t knew what nor why but she assumed he had a reason. Right now she had some amount of trust towards Saber, mostly because she  learned that they need each other to a degree. She needs him to fight and he needs her to remain in this world.

While so far Saber looked nice an all, she was used to distrust due to her many years of work dealing with mages and treats towards her clan. But a mutually beneficial relationship worked better as it was based on the foundation of logic. That much was enough for her, at least for now. She dressed quickly into some easy to move clothes as she seat down back in the bed to listen to Saber. 

&quot;One would think that you would be summoned with that but I digress, I will but on the condition you hide that sword while we are outside. We don&#39;t want to attract attention by having that falling down or people noticing it to much. So once we out of here we need to get you some new clothes so you can hide that sword as well in those.&quot;

The way this relationship was, at least in her eyes she needed to stablish certain boundaries and reach a common ground. For that it was important to let Saber know she will humor on although a certain degree but and depending on what was asked. 

&quot;Oh sure go ahead. What you wanna say?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber is always unconditionally loyal to his Master but he wants to know if his loyalty is placed within the right, no, <em>best</em> person. There can only be one question that can answer that.

...

Nevermind, thought Saber. <em>That</em> one is best saved for another time. Right now, Saber has something else in store... it may be completely irrelevant to the greater ritual though. If anything, it is probably just small talk.

&quot;Was that alcohol? Where are your parents?&quot;

A pretty simple question. Saber wishes to know if Gloria has any guardians of some sort which may imply the existence of outside connections that could potentially assist them in their quest for the Holy Grail. Any help could be useful though that question should have been better worded. Saber should totally do that.

&quot;Actually Master, do you have any support from the outside?&quot;

Not only will it answer the actual intent, it would also satisfy a bit of Saber&#39;s curiosity. I mean, what is this kid doing with a bottle of what could possibly be alcohol and the absence of any guardian? Could be a runaway, but whatever it is something fun to know about.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why you asking that?&quot;  she was obviously confused by the question specially when it came to suddenly asking about her parents. &quot;Yeah it was alcohol, is a drink I keep with me it has a strong taste but its good for the cold. I drank it for the first time a few years ago and somewhat got hooked on it. Many of the guys I work with like that drink for some reason.&quot;

While Gloria wasn&#39;t that much of a talk person she was ready to humor Saber question to a degree. She took it as maybe he was just curious on it or that maybe he wanted to learn a bit more of it before trying it himself. 

&quot;Is made of a liquor from my home town named Pisco, it has this color cause it they leaved some herbs and ginseng marinating in it to give it some special flavor...&quot; she took a pause as she debated whenever she should humor him more. &quot;My parent are back in Peru while I deal with this situation and yeah I have support from the outside.  Me and many other work together but each are following their own clues I just happened to learn of the grail first so I came here. We are spread a bit thin so don&#39;t expect any member of my family to come visit or anything.&quot;

She ignored why Saber asked this and so decided to leave it a bit vague as she didn&#39;t like sharing stuff about herself. &quot;Oh there is also a benefactor I do business with named Ritcher but doubt he will be of much help as supposedly he put all the information he had on that book.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Kind of makes him want to try it, but <em>something</em> is telling him that it may taste bad in his mouth. Whatever, that is one thing.

So she came here by herself huh, definitely supports the runaway idea. It however falls flat as Gloria implied the existence of her peers doing the same thing as she does, implying that this has been a collaborative work from the start. Is this kid... older than she seems? This Ritcher guy, she may have gotten the knowledge of the Grail from him. That is all he needs to know.

&quot;I see, I see. Just one little thing though, Master.

How old are you?&quot;

Saber decided the best move was to ask his Master her age.  His facial expression and body language radiates curiosity, there does not seem to be any ulterior motive to the question. However, internally, Saber is absolutely losing it in a silent laughter. A little teasing wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone, he thought. Though he could only expect a cool and composed answer from someone like her since she has acted mature ever since they got here.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One would think that after hearing it so many times from so many different people Gloria would be used to it and not even consider any underlying reason to ask this even less think that such reason to ask this was rude in nature.

A small fireball would flew next to Saber face, smash into the wall leaving a black stained circle as the smell of burn filled the room for a bit before the smoke exit the room through one of the windows.

Saber would see Gloria&#39;s eyes turn blank her finger up and pointing at the spot where the black spot on the wall was. 

&quot;Before I answer Saber&quot; the tone of her voice was completely cold devoid of any feeling. No, that wasn&#39;t right it would be more accurate to say there was a cold rage just waiting for the opportunity to come out. &quot;I want you to realize I am only answering this once and once I do we are to never talk about this topic again okay?&quot;

Her smile was so fake it was easy to see this was quite a taboo topic for her. 

&quot;I am a 26 year old woman with a kid back home.&quot; she said with a plain face as another small fireball appeared on her finger. &quot;I suggest you think your next words properly before speaking&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though she may act all cool, she still has the tendency to just lose it. Guess Gloria wasn&#39;t as calm and sensible as Saber thought, otherwise she would have responded with words of discipline instead of <em>that</em>. Saber sighed and shook his head.

&quot;V-very well, Master. I can assure you that it will never come up again&quot;, Saber said with a shaken voice.

Saber kneeled on the ground and bowed with his head touching the floor, prostrating himself in <em>dogeza</em> to give his most sincere apologies. Though it may look bizarre to foreigners, performing dogeza is to plead for forgiveness. Not just simply asking for it, but deeply begging for it. 

Nowadays, dogeza is only ever done when the one at fault has made a grave mistake. In the past, it was actually pretty common. Recorded data at the time consists of commoners kneeling in respect to persons with a high status when they happen to pass by.

...

It does not seem like Saber is getting up any time soon. Perhaps he genuinely feels sorry for deviating from his purpose as a Servant. For the time being, Saber kneels in silence.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Regardless of how extreme her reaction was, its not like she didn&#39;t understood where Saber was coming from when he asked her that. She was well aware she didn&#39;t  look her age and that it was unreasonable to expect people to not think the obvious and assume she was younger. 

Issue was that even when understood that, emotionally it wasn&#39;t so simple. Years and years to having to deal with this situation had obviously take a toll on her mentally. 

It was a condition some member of her clan had. A side effect coming from the origin of their magecraft which manifest in ways that couldn&#39;t be predicted in any way. In her case her development and metabolism was slower compared to a regular women and it only make her worse the older she got. There was nothing to he done and while the idea of being younger than what you look may sound appear for Gloria all the downsides overpower any positives. 

Something as simple as just having a child had been nothing short of a miracle for her. Due to her condition the time she had to get pregnant was shorter than most women not even mentioning some of the complications.

She let out a sigh. 

&quot;Is a long story I will tell you one day. For now stand up.&quot; She said as she calm herself up. &quot;Is sort of a trigger for me, so let&#39;s just leave it at that.&quot;

She went back to the bed looking away from Saber. It was a bit embarrassing to say the least as this was a part of her she didn&#39;t like showing but it was hard to control as well. 

Normally she wouldn&#39;t care as people who she showed were one time meetings but she and Saber were supposed to work together. 

&quot;Oh right the book Ritchen mention a big shortage of power a few months ago. People in the plane were really concerned they were wondering if it could happen again and they would fall to their deaths. Think is related to the war??&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was pretty cute and funny, thought Saber. He now knows that his Master won&#39;t hesitate to bust his pretty face into a pulp if he ever tries it again. Must have struck a nerve or something for her to react like that, but Saber doesn&#39;t know her that well for him to know what ticks her off. Saber messed around and found out.

Hmm, a massive power outage that struck a few months ago. If it was massive enough to cause concerns among passengers in a plane, then it must have been a nationwide or perhaps regional event. Something like that can&#39;t naturally happen, that&#39;s for sure. If it was caused by a natural phenomenon then the whole world would have felt it and not just the electricity within these borders and, judging from the state of things, society as a whole has not collapsed yet. It must have been caused by state incompetence or something called a <em>miracle</em>.

Saber thought carefully for a bit. Yeah, there is no doubt, it must have been caused by something supernatural. It cannot be a Servant, as Servants, as far as he knows, could only be summoned during the Holy Grail War. If it is related to the Holy Grail War, then the prime culprit for such an event must be whoever is overseeing the war. If it is not, then it will be a little difficult to tell exactly who as it must be someone who can perform a miracle on this scale.

In any case, the ultimate goal in the end is to win the Grail. Saber is not the investigative type, but if banishing the mystery of this miracle is part of the process then he will go ahead and slay this mystery with his blade. Saber cleared his throat.

&quot;I would like to think not, but, even if it is, our goal remains the same.

Well, Master. How about you, what do you think?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That doesn&#39;t change the goal but how maybe how we end up reaching it.&quot; While she understood Saber line of though to a degree she couldn&#39;t just not care at least not totally. It was a habit for her at this point, she had survived so long by paying attention to the small details and preparing herself. While it was true that the power outage could have nothing to do with the Grail in the case it did what did it change?? That was the question.

&quot;Well I mostly agree with you. It could just be a big coincidence but I rather discuss it so if we come up for more information we can be prepared and connect the dots. I have come to learn that is those sudden coincidences which actually end up messing even the most elaborate plan. So lets just pay attention to it while we move&quot;

She finally allowed herself to relax, tiredness began to invade her as her sudden outburst alongside with a day in the cold and the mana she used for the summoning began to catch up for them. Still as she felt herself wanting to sleep for the night she recalled the missed asking one of the most basic questions she should right off the bat. 

&quot;Hey Saber who are you?&quot; It was only fair, Saber has asked her some questions and knew her named so she should knew that much as well. &quot;And before you try to be funny about it, I mean your identity as an heroic spirit.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked around the room as if there could be someone present with them or someone that could hear them. Saber knows better than to reveal that kind of information about him in an area where people could potentially hear him speak, you never know if they could be enemies later on. He thought a bit for a good name... that&#39;s it!

&quot;John Smith.&quot;

He spoke as if it was the truth. His face insists that it truly is. Saber-class Servant, John Smith. Has a western sound to it, in spite of his appearance as a person from the orient. Well, it is time for Saber to make up a story for that name. Something that sounds pretty plausible... alright, that one sounds good!

&quot;I invented the lawnmower.
I mow off the heads of snakes with the blades of my lawn.
My peers call me, the grass-cutting aficionado.
Well, um... yeah!&quot;

He pumped his fist into the air with a smile of a person who is totally making stuff up, but whoever could be listening in won&#39;t be able to tell. In truth, Saber does not wish to reveal his identity in a place like this, he feels as if it is not secure enough. The walls feel like they have eyes and ears to him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t that big of a deal right now, in the end his name didn&#39;t matter if he was unable to perform well in a fight. That is not to say that she didn&#39;t mind it. It was more akin that right now she could afford to let him keep his secret but as things progressed she was gonna get an answer one way or another even if it meant forcing it out of him. 

&quot;As long as you win I will call you whatever you want&quot; she said a she moved into the bed and cover herself reading herself to sleep.  &quot;Just be sure to tell me when it becomes important I may respect your secrets but I wont die for them.&quot;

While it sounded logic and all, it was quite the weird approach she was taking. She had no reason not to force an answer out of Saber through other means that let them somewhat dodge people listening to them. Gloria herself hasn&#39;t noticed it, but her perception had began to warped towards servants. She knew they weren&#39;t humans and could distance them a bit in her mind but her appearance being so similar it made her unconsciously treat them as if they were. 

It was a flaw in her mentality due to her upbring in a more secluded village. The laws and mentality of regular magi didn&#39;t apply to her at all. She was a wild card which people couldn&#39;t predict. 

&quot;Well Im going to bed, turn off the light and don&#39;t try to play a prank on me or I will shoot you&quot; she said a she let him see a gun hidden under her pillow. It was not meant for Saber but she may as well use it on him as well.  &quot;Goodnight Saber&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the end, at least she let him get away with keeping information about himself a mystery. Saber does not intend on losing the element of surprise especially since he just got summoned, it would be a massive inconvenience if all his tricks are revealed from the start.

It seems to Saber that his Master still lacks confidence in him, even implying that she won&#39;t go out of her way to help him out if he ever gets himself in a pickle. It reminds him of that <em>one feeling</em> when he was alive. Saber is a little saddened by that thought and it does not help that she is actively threatening him with violence, he hopes to eventually earn Gloria&#39;s respect along their journey to victory. Never again, thought Saber.

Actually, maybe those threats are warranted. Saber did fool around and found out after all and ended up coming out as an inconsiderate person. Though, that&#39;s one more impression to shatter once he proves himself to his Master. All the more satisfying once he breaks them all, it gives Saber something else to strive for aside from the Grail.

&quot;Rest well, Master.

In that case, I will stand guard for any threats.&quot;

By &quot;stand guard&quot;, Saber actually intends to just sleep. Since Saber refuses to go into a spirit form, he may unintentionally consume energy which could be used when an active threat is present. In that case, Saber will just sit down in the corner of the room, turn off the lights, and get some shut eye.

Saber prays for a good night of sleep for him and his Master. Rest will be nothing but a bygone privilege once everything starts happening.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
