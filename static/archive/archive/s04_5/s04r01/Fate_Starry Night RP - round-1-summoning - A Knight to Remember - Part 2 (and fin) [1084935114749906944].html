He placed his cloak on the table and the book he had carried with him to this point with care, then he glanced around the room, realizing that he was feeling quite peckish as of right now. 

Levan Cherkezishvili was a Knight of the Church living and working in the Vatican, though he was sometimes sent out to help other abbeys. But more than just a Knight, he was now a Master supposed to join a Holy Grail War somewhere on an island in Egypt.

Was it really correct to call him a Master, knowing that he had not yet summoned any Servant? Maybe not. But on the back of his left hand had been etched in red ink a few days ago a weird tatoo shaped like some kind of shamrock, and though he tried to hide it by wearing gloves to avoid being jailed for a week for getting a tattoo, it was a sign that he had been chosen to be a potential participant in this secret conflict between wizards and magicians he had heard about quite a few times during his work.
Man, magic, what a drag. He knew nothing about it and didn&#39;t want to learn about it. But he had understood that there was a wish of his choosing at stake, which would be granted by the Holy Chalice touched by the blood of Christ, and it would be a slap in fate&#39;s face to just pass on such a bargain, moreso that he could also try to retrieve the relic and definitely get promoted for this. 

For real though, can you imagine that?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084935784718684212 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084935784718684212><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:27 PM">3:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>You&#39;re offered the chance to get the thing you want most in the world, and in exchange, you just have to not getting your arse murdered. That was something Levan was good at: he was quite proud of his ability to stay out of harm&#39;s way and not get his arse murdered in any way. He was still young, but he had seen things and the fact that he was still around was surprising even to himself.

This ancientbook he had brought back with him from the Apostolic Library would, if he wasn&#39;t mistaken, detail the ritual necessary to summon a Servant and officially join the War. 

Whatever the details of this War might be, for what seemed like the first time in his life, the Knight had made a decision on his own. He knew he didn&#39;t have to join that scary war-thing in Egypt, but he had chosen to do so anyway. Maybe it was a big mistake, but it would be a mistake he owed to himself and not to anyone else. The times of indecision was over, Levan was a new man. Never again would he let fate get the better of him! If was fricking going to do it and survive and get his wish granted and get home and get promoted and get married and get children and get everything a man should strive to get before being able to pass away with the mind at ease.

Crippling PTSD wasn&#39;t a risk, right?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084935900565340161 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084935900565340161><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:27 PM">3:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then Levan decided to make an omelet. 

He turned on the stove and quickly felt the air in the room warm up. It wasn&#39;t exactly cold previously, but it wasn&#39;t heated and it always felt good to put your hands over the fire.

The monastery was not equipped with electricity, everything ran on gas, from heating to lighting. 
Once the stove was warm, careful not to wake up the rare residents at this time of the year who were sleeping peacefully just one floor above the shared kitchen, he took a frying pan and sprinkled it with water before placing it on the spot provided for that purpose over the stove. He went back to the refrigerator to get a bar of butter, from which he cut a large piece with a knife, which ended up on the crackling pan. Levan opened a cupboard above the fire and grabbed three free-range eggs freshly collected from the chicken coop behind the monastery. In a small wooden bowl, he cracked the eggs without bothering to separate the whites from the yolks and seasoned them with thyme, rosemary, a pinch of salt, and a tiny amount of garlic.

&quot;I stir, I stir, I stir... and there you go!&quot; 

Pouring his eggs into the well-oiled pan and turning down the stove to make sure he didn&#39;t burn this mother of all omelets, Italian-Georgian Deluxe Superare Edition, Levan went to sit at the table where he had left his coat and book. He grabbed the latter as carefully as possible and looked at its brown leather front and back covers with nothing written on them. Then, to pass the time until his late night snack™️ was ready, he began to read through it absent-mindedly. It was a strange, thin book, written in Latin.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936062968807504 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936062968807504><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:28 PM">3:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Levan recognized a few words and ideas here and there, but it was definitely not his strong point; he hated Latin, and he hated reading.

As he distractedly turned the pages without really trying to decipher anything, his eyes fell on a double-page spread of strange sketches. Circles with sigils. It made him frown, especially when he read the word &quot;sanguis&quot;, the Latin for blood. What the devilry!?

He flew over the drawings to a small paragraph written in a hurry in a corner, surely an incantation judging by the turns of phrase; alas, time had taken its toll and it was impossible to read what was written. Levan had understood that to bring to this world a Servant, a summoning circle, a &quot;catalyst&quot; (whatever the hell it means) and an incantation were necessary. The circle, that was easy to get, but he didn&#39;t have a catalyst or a spell to recite in front of it. 
Would he even be able to make his summoning circle work, given that he knew next to nothing about magic? 
Was the catalyst mandatory? He had no idea, and frankly, he was going to go by instinct. Whatever happens, happens. 

A good smell filled the room and Levan abandoned his book to turn off the stove and retrieve his omelet, which he would eat with a fork, for lack of bread. 

His little midnight meal finished and filled up, like the good husband he would be one day, Levan washed the dishes and put away everything he had used, making sure he hadn&#39;t dirtied anything, before turning off the lamp and walking quietly upstairs to his room, the book under his arm.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936307513491587 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936307513491587><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:29 PM">3:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He reached the door and penetrated his bedroom, trying to make as little noise as possible. Then he put the book on his desk before dropping onto his bed.

The room was small but comfortable. The floor was impeccably waxed, the desk was in perfect order (since Levan never sat on it), the bed didn&#39;t squeak (God, he hated squeaky beds!), his closet held all his material possessions and finally (arguably not much) and a large window let the room glow in the moonlight, giving the scene a relaxing atmosphere. On one wall, there was a small statue of Jesus Christ on his cross. 

Levan glanced at his desk with the book on it, illuminated by a Machiavellian moonlight ray.

<em>You could totally try to Summon a Servant right now, said a little voice inside his head.</em>

Don&#39;t be an idiot, Levan! What if someone knows you did it? Wouldn&#39;t you get excommunicated? 

<em>It&#39;s almost Christmas, appart from old-timers and a couple of friars, everybody went home. You couldn&#39;t wake up anybody, even if you tried to. And getting any wish you want granted is worth putting your career at risk, isn&#39;t it?</em>

Still, there ARE people here. What if the Servant broke loose and started attacking everybody?

<em>Come on now, it can&#39;t be that dangerous. Otherwise, nobody would ever participate in Grail Wars, right?</em>

Is that right...?

<em>Come on, you know you want to try! Don&#39;t be such a pussy.</em>

Who are you calling a pussy exactly?

<em>You&#39;d do it?</em>

Ah, to Hell with that! Curiosity killed the cat, but it couldn&#39;t killed me, Levan thought to himself. Let&#39;s get to work.

Determined not to let the little voice inside of him call him a coward just like in <em>La Haine (1995)</em>, Levan got up from his bed and went to his desk to get the book and a bit of charcoal that was lying around, as he was the rightful CEO of not thinking things through.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936512099070072 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936512099070072><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:30 PM">3:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With the book open to the page showing the circle in one hand, the charcoal in the other, the knight squatted on the floor and began to reproduce the drawing, doing his best to not mess up. He had no idea what the ideal size for a summoning circle was, so he made it big enough to sit in. Of course, he wasn&#39;t planning to sit in it, it&#39;s just so he had a reference. 
... Did he need to sit in the summoning circle?

The more the drawing became refined and he drew some obvious cabalistic signs who were raising some red flags for someone who was supposed to be a man of God, the more Levan began to think that he might be doing something monumentally stupid and invoking the Devil in his room. But it was a little late to ask himself these kinds of questions now. Back down, and have the voice inside of him call him a pussy again? No thanks. 

Levan had very little willpower, he was what was generally called a &quot;rag doll&quot;. He never answered when he was lectured, always polite and restrained, quietly doing his job and only complaining and whining when alone. He had desires and aspirations, but he never found the motivation to make them come true. He was like that, a loser from birth. But since this story of Christ&#39;s cups, tattoos and heroes of the past had come into his life, he felt that he had to take a chance on this business, that it was essential to his growth.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936624992944228 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936624992944228><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:30 PM">3:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Levan didn&#39;t know if he was sinning -- it was likely, but this was the first time he felt the urge to see things through, to let himself choose what he wants to do.

But he was fed up with his lack of courage, you know? Didn&#39;t some guy on the radio say something along the lines of &quot;the most clear sign of the end is the disappearance or resolve.&quot;?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936688427614319 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936688427614319><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:31 PM">3:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Was it true? Because it sure sounded like it was true. All of his life, he did things because it was the best thing to do, but now he could try and do something that wasn&#39;t the best thing to do, and it was exciting, it made his blood pump like crazy. 

So he completed the circle and leapt to his feet. It was time to maniefst his destiny. There was no turning back.

Following the instructions written in Latin on the book, Levan decided to let his instincts do the work. Nevermind classes, rituels, Heroic Spirits and whatnot, let&#39;s do it.

With his heart beating faster than usual, the young man threw the book on his bed and stood up straight in front of his rough circle, all awkward-feeling.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084936826483118121 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084936826483118121><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 3:31 PM">3:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He had absolutely no idea if it would work or not, and what he should say, but he tried anyway.

&quot;Hmm... Um... Hello?&quot;

No response. Obviously, idiot!

&quot;Heheh... that&#39;s kind of embarassing. Any sign, anything? I need some direction.&quot;

Still nothing. Levan felt himself heating up a bit, but he had no way of knowing if it was a sign that it was working or just the shame that was killing him for thinking he could do something reserved for mystical witches and wise, educated ancient wizards. 
A moonbeam reflected off his crucifix hanging on the wall and it gave him an idea. Who should you ask for counseling when you&#39;re lost -- and a Christian? 

&quot;Jesus Christ, Lord and Savior, I have no idea of what I&#39;m doing right, if I have to be frank. I think I&#39;m simply going mad. Please, please, show me the way or something. I could really use a little help right now. I don&#39;t really understand what are you plans for me, but if you could be as kind as to help me know if that whole Holy Grail War thing is worth a damn, that&#39;d be much appreciated. You know how much I love you, right?&quot;

He swallowed and wiped his forehead, smiling a little.

&quot;As always, keep me away from sin and the Devil&#39;s work. So, if you wish for me to summon a Servant right here and now, then so be it. I don&#39;t really care who, as long as they&#39;re cool. And <em>please, please, please,</em> make it so I&#39;m not summoning Satan, a demon or any type of evil presence, alright?&quot;

...


...

His lack of understanding left him without a proper catalyst; he lacked an oath to bind himself to the gift that is a servant. Despite the Knight&#39;s unfamiliarity, his actions were not in vain. Perhaps it was the scent of roasted herbs and garlic and the oil residue on the stovetop. It could have been his plea to a higher power, solidifying his intention to the world... Or perhaps it was fate... Even more likely, it was all three. 

The cold silence that once followed Levan&#39;s prayer would come to an end. The satanic-looking circle emitted a brilliant purple light. The floor quaked, and a violent wind pressed against the walls of the room, threatening to knock Levan off his feet. The &#39;magic&#39; that Levan pondered was undoubtedly real; it was happening right in front of him. The rumbling circle marked a new beginning for the Knight. His resolve would be tested, his cowardice could be overcome, death would soon look him in the eyes, and what Levan made of his new destiny was for him to decide. 

 The purple light would expand across the room, momentarily blinding Levan. The energy from the circle dissipated at once, leaving silence once again. However, this time was different; Levan was not alone. A wonderful fragrance filled the air. Blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and watermelon. It was a melody of smells, all so fresh and distinct. The smell of roasting meat, garlic, and vegetables followed soon after. It smelt like a magnificent feast was happening right at the doorstep. Every scent was vibrant and unique, yet they didn&#39;t clash, each one feeling as though it belonged.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085096461290704947 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085096461290704947><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 2:05 AM">2:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In the center of the &#39;satanic&#39; circle was a man not there before. Standing at 207 centimeters, he was barely clothed, revealing a supermodel-like physique. A bright purple toga hung from his left shoulder, concealing the lower half of his olive skin. His purple hair resembled the color of perfectly ripe grapes. The wavy locks of hair were held together by a piece of twine, the ponytail draping over his right shoulder. Leather sandals covered the soles of his feet, black straps wrapped around his shins, holding the sandals in place. 

The mystery man looked in Levan&#39;s direction. His violet eyes stared the Knight down, yet he did not speak. In fact, it looked like he was thinking. After an awkward silence, the servant&#39;s mouth would open.

&quot;Thyme, rosemary, minced garlic, eggs, and a high quality olive oil. The lasting fragrance tells me the ingredients where cooked slowly on a low temperature, the proper way to cook quality eggs.&quot; The servant&#39;s eyes shifted to the window, observing the beam of moonlight that invaded Levan&#39;s room. &quot;However, you ought to know that eggs alone are not a good dinner. A good protein to start the day, of course, but for the most important meal of the day you should do better.&quot;

He covered his eyes when the summoning circle emitted that blinding purple light and kept them closed until he heard the smooth but honest and confident voice of someone he didn&#39;t know. 

Levan summoned up the what small bits of bravery he had in him and looked around, finally noticing that in the center of the summoning circle stood a man who was beautiful in every sense of the word. He was towering! Levan was not short by any means, but that guy made him feel like he was. He was half-naked, which was of course a little worrisome and was absolutely ripped, a unit of a man with fine, very fine facial features. 

Grabbing Jesus&#39; statue by reflex, Levan kissed it and silently thanked him, his call had been answered and that was all he had asked for. His faith was renewed and his excitement rivaled his fear in that moment. He turned his attention back to what could only be a Greek god -- or the Devil himself but in any case, bad news. Everything about him was charming and that&#39;s what was scary. 

&quot;Hum... hello? And what is protein?&quot; 

A little frightened by what could only be a Servant, Levan preferred to keep his distance for the moment, even if he really had nowhere to run. The door to his room was blocked by the Devil.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mithaecus was imparted with enough knowledge to know that he was summoned far removed from his own time, however the custom of kissing tiny metal men was rather bizzare. Still Mithaecus wanted to approach the situation with an open mind. Afterall, the person who summoned him had cooked a homemade meal only moments before the summoning. Sure, the dish wasn&#39;t ideal for a late night meal, but the technique seemed commendable. 

Mithaecus had given Levan the benefit of the doubt, however, all it took was one fatal question to sour the casters mood. &quot;What is protein?!&quot; Mithaecus&#39;s words grew sharp, his head tilted towards the ceiling, his eyes gazing down on the Knight with unfathomable disappointment. &quot;Protein is the building block of a truly great physique. The flesh and eggs of animals are high in protein. It is required to form healthy muscle, and to power us through a good days work. To believe that you could cook without knowing something so simple. Do you even cut your meat with a knife? Or do you rip into it like some barbarian?&quot; 

Was that an insult? All Levan did was ask a simple question, yet the servants response was rather violent. Perhaps Levan accidentally poked the wrong button in Caster&#39;s mind. Even stranger than Mithaecus&#39;s insult was his knowledge of protein. It was easy to tell that Mithaecus wore ancient Greek apparel, yet he held knowledge of modern day nutrition and dispensed like it was a well known fact, even among his own time.

Had he said something insulting? 

Not wanting to take any chances with Mithaecus, Levan raised his arms in front of him as an appeasement gesture to ask his new best friend to keep his voice down or else he would wake up the whole Monastery.

&quot;Alright, I&#39;m sorry! I don&#39;t cook often, so it was to be expected that I wouldn&#39;t know what protein is; now I do! Jesus!&quot;

Once he was sure that the apology had been accepted by Mithaecus and that he wasn&#39;t going to get his head ripped off for his lack of culinary culture, Levan headed for the door, passing right by the Servant and the summoning circle to lock it. When he had done so, he turned his attention back to the newcomer, anxiety now giving way to fascination. 

Clearly, the ritual had been successful and Mithaecus was the Servant that answered the summoning. Levan was just feeling a bit tired physically and despite having eaten just a few minutes earlier, he was already ready for round two. It was probably the ritual that had drained his energy, he thought, but nothing insurmountable. The little voice had been right, he was still alive and now new challengers had entered the arena -- the arena being the Holy Grail War and the challenger, Levan and the big guy.
He could hardly believe it, but facts were there: there was no going back anymore now that he had his own personal magical familiar. It was ride or die (figurativement, mind you, Levan didn&#39;t want to die one bit).

The young man hung up the crucifix on his wall and sat down on the bed, leaving the handsome man free to sit at the desk if the chair would accommodate his height. What to do now? In this situation, it was surely a good idea to ask Mithaecus who he was exactly and his Class, or to inquire about his abilities. But Levan thought otherwise.

&quot;How tall are you exactly? Did protein make you grow so big? I can&#39;t believe cooking held a secret like that since the beginning.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The apology would be enough to shut Caster&#39;s mouth, however the judgemental stare remained. Although, it wasn&#39;t exactly clear what Mithaecus was judging. The apology was immediate, Levan admitted his mistake as fast as he had made it. This was a commendable act, however, Mithaecus was now questioning the aroma of food. It was a pleasant aroma, properly cooked, yet the boy before him seemed to know nothing of the culinary arts. Had proper cooking technique become common knowledge? Had the teachers of such techniques excluded the nutritional benefits for their manuscripts? Mithaecus had raised many questions to himself in so little time. The fact that an inexperienced cook held enough knowledge to properly prepare a dish, filled him with hope. Had his goal to teach cooking to the world been realized to some degree?


Mithaecus&#39;s curiosity had now gotten the better of him. His head was lost in a spiral of thought, he had to know the mark he left on the world. He was summoned by Levan so surely he must know about his own servant. Yes, Mithaecus had much to inquire about. He tried to articulate his thoughts, thinking of where to start asking questions. 

Before Mithaecus could organize his head, he would be pulled back to reality by his Master&#39;s question. &quot;My height? Such an astute observation!&quot; Mithaecus clapped his hands together, a bright smile rushed across his face. While it&#39;s normal to ask a servant their class and identity, Levan had made the right choice to stray from normalcy and give Mithaecus a chance to stroke his ego. 

&quot;If you must know I&#39;m one orgyia and a lichas tall, two-hundred-seven centimeters to you. And you&#39;re correct about the secret to my height! A good diet goes a long way to building a strong body.

Brother Luca takes care of that.&quot; 

Whatever the case, Levan was in awe of Mithaecus&#39; dream body. He couldn&#39;t help but think that if he looked like that, no one could ever mess with him again. Maybe he could even command respect if he was that huge? It was all very promising and Levan was definitely happy to be the Greek&#39;s partner, hoping Mithaecus would teach him a thing or two along the way.

But it was better for Mithaecus not to dwell on the subject of nutrition with Levan. At that time, it was a subject that thanks to his efforts had been brought to light and also explored from top to bottom. In that sense, he had been a true pioneer in the field and even though only a single page of his <em>magnus opus</em> remained for posterity as well as the story of his exclusion from Sparta, Mithaecus had served humanity in his own way and it was now commonly known that the secret to long life was good food, physical activity. After all, who in 1999 could claim not to know the name of Arnold Schwarzenneger and these crazy images of him eating extremely large meals?

But Levan was the kind of guy who confused escalators and elevators in his head, so he couldn&#39;t be expected to know anything about cooking, much less the identity of his Servant. If Mithaecus found out, it would surely infuriate him, but since the beginning of their pleasant conversation following the successful summoning, Levan had no idea what name to put on the tall man with the purple hair&#39;s face. He had decided that it would be &quot;the Devil&quot; until Mithaecus decided to introduce himself, hoping with all his heart he wouldn&#39;t just start hitting him if he knew absolutely nothing about his work.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085843939837362177 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085843939837362177><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 3:36 AM">3:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He continued to converse with his Servant, since he really had no idea what a Master was supposed to do and their little chat was pretty fun, albeit Mithaecus proved to look scary at times.

This time Levan&#39;s lack of knowledge had not insulted Mithaecus, rather it left him dumbfounded. At this point it was clear that basic nutritional information had pierced the realm of common knowledge, although it was still limited. Furthermore, Mithaecus was willing to hold back any further judgment of Levan as long as he was willing to learn. Ignorance was tolerable, but willful ignorance was unacceptable. Hopefully Levan would become a proper student to Mithaecus&#39;s ways. 

&quot;Yes, well... Spinach is certainly good for you, it is arguably one of the best greens you can eat. Notably it keeps everything in your body moving properly, if you know what I mean. Gastronomy was my primary school of study when I grew up in Syracuse. Spinach and I have been great friends since.&quot; 

Mithaecus&#39;s voice was full of glee. It was easy to tell that Caster genuinely enjoyed sharing his knowledge. In life his teachings had been rejected by the Greek masses, perhaps his rejection was a motivating reason behind his adamant nature. 

&quot;But that&#39;s enough talk about food, why don&#39;t we actually eat something? Learning about one another over a meal is always ideal.&quot; Mithaecus stepped forward, brushing past Levan, approaching the door. &quot;Where is your kitchen?&quot;

He had in front of him a real passionate man and, as far as he could tell, probably a good bloke who really thought that his work could benefit the greatest number. It was quite wholesome, in a way. 

But Caster had no idea who he was dealing with. Did he think he was going to be able to make Levan his kitchen clerk and an apprentice? Good luck with that! Inculcating anything into the Knight was no easy feat, although he was still very young and despite all the zeal he could muster, his memory was pretty crappy to the point that he actually didn&#39;t even remember any of the basic prayers a Christian was supposed to know. Now, here&#39;s hoping Mithaecus was an exceptionally good teacher. 

Levan&#39;s face lit up when he heard the big guy say he hailed from Syracuse. He may not have known much about history but he knew that Syracuse was a region in Sicily that was de facto part of Italy. Now, he didn&#39;t want to go into politics and semantics, but apparently it was a dumb thing to do to call a Sicilian guy Italian at present with the whole independence movement thing going on and the mafia backing it up, but Levan happily noted that in theory, he and Mithaecus were fellow countrymen.
In and of itself, Levan was more Georgian than Italian, just as Mithaecus was more Greek than Sicilian, but they both lived on the same land and were therefore destined to be best friends forever (again, according to Levan).

Then Mithaecus decided that he wanted to start cooking without waiting and, a bit tired by the summoning ritual, the new Master in town took him up on that offer, feeling like a second omelette could help him recover. 

&quot;The kitchen is downstairs. Try not to make too much noise coming down, we&#39;ll be in big trouble if anybody wakes up.&quot;

As it stood Mithaecus had yet to inquire anything about Levan. The Caster was too focused on himself, granted Levan had given Mithaecus a chance to stroke his ego. However as the two would soon come to find out, they didn&#39;t have much in common. Levan was correct that they technically shared a home country, however, even this connection was very little. Mithaecus would not consider himself Italian, rather he&#39;d call himself Sicilian or Greek. Still, it was a connection, no matter how small. Perhaps Levan&#39;s wish to have a best friend wasn&#39;t completely out of reach. 

Standing in the middle of the kitchen, Mithaecus would wait for Levan to decend the stairs behind him. &quot;Tell me Levan, what is your comfort food. A dish that made you hop with excitement when your mother made it?&quot;

I&#39;m pretty sure I could get kicked out of the Order for this, or worse. We should stay low for now I think.&quot; 

The young man followed the Servant, closing the door to his room, descending silently the staircase of wood and entering the small kitchen after him. Levan went to where he had left the kerosene lamp and turned it on so that the room would bask for the second time that night in the flickering yellow light. 

&quot;Comfort food, uh? I don&#39;t know about that, I&#39;m not really picky or anything. If it’s edibable, I’ll eat it.&quot;

Still, he forced himself to think and he smiled.

&quot;Oh! I was born on February 27, so my mom always made me Lazi khachapuri for my birthday. I really like cheese. As everybody does. Cheese is cool.&quot;

Khachapuri was a popular Georgian culinary specialty not only throughout the country but also in the former state members of the Soviet Union. The dish could be described as a sort of hybrid between a pizza and a fondue; it was a flattened bread shaped like a turnover and stuffed with cow&#39;s milk cheese. You had to slice off pieces of bread and dip them in the melted cheese in the center while it was still hot. The khachapuri that Levan liked best was the Adjarian variant shaped like a boat and often studded with spices, coriander and an egg. 

&quot;Too bad we don&#39;t have cheese here tonight. Anyway I don&#39;t think you know the recipe, it&#39;s a pretty niche and hard dish to cook and you&#39;re Sicilian and all. So I guess an omelette is just fine. Omelette is as cool as cheese.&quot;

His voice raised probably reinforcing Levan&#39;s fears of waking someone up. &quot;There&#39;s not a single thing in the world that I can&#39;t cook. If khachapuri is what you want, khachapuri is what you&#39;ll get. I just hope I can match your mother&#39;s cooking.&quot; A smirk crawled across the Casters face. Of course he would match Levan&#39;s mother, no one was better then him at cooking! Or so he selfishly thought. 

Turning towards the stove counter, a book would materialize in Mithaecus&#39;s hand. He laid it on the counter, flipping it open to the exact page he needed. Written on the page was a recipe for khachapuri, however the language was an extinct Greek dialect making it hard for Levan to work out.
Caster&#39;s eyes would quicky scan over the recipe. Now ready to cook, his hand would wave over the counter, a slew of ingredients materializing from thin air. &quot;I hope Imeruli cheese is &#39;cool&#39; enough for you&quot;. On the once empty counter was was now every ingredient needed to make khachapuri. The dough was already premade, as making it from scratch would have taken much too long. Although, one could argue that Mithaecus creating the dough with his mana was about as involved someone could be in creating their dough.

Mithaecus&#39;s hand spun the dial on the oven, letting the heating process begin. As the stove heated up, Caster&#39;s hands would handle the dough shaping it and placing the filling inside. The speed and diligence that he worked with made it seem as though Mithaecus prepared this dish every single day of his life. Once the dough was shaped, a pizza stone would materialize in Mithaecus&#39;s hands. With one movement he would scoop the unbaked khachapuri onto the stone before swiftly placing it in the oven.


&quot;It&#39;s not the healthiest meal, but I suppose we can give you a cheat meal before we start your strict dietary regiment.&quot;

The big guy was confident in his skills! That was good to know. Levan could distinctly sniff out in the tone of his voice and his gestures that he had every intention of pulverizing his mother&#39;s culinary career and he was very excited for it.

He curiously inspected the book written in an alphabet he recognized as Greek when it appeared out of nothing. 

&quot;So this is magic, uh?&quot;

Levan couldn&#39;t believe it when Mithaecus conjured up some ingredients and got to work. Standing next to the chef, he marveled at the Servant&#39;s show of strength. 

&quot;Hail Mary, full of grace... You can use magic to create food?&quot; 

Since he really didn&#39;t know anything about the subject, the young man was impressed by anything and everything. Levan had never seen mages use magic for anything other than destroying or fighting and using it to cook was unthinkable to him. He was curious to see if everything would taste like magic. 

Mithaecus&#39; technique was perfect. Even through the eyes of a neophyte, everything was too &quot;smooth&quot;, every movement calculated down to the last detail. Mithaecus didn&#39;t even seem to be kneading the dough, more like the dough was obeying his will. 
Maybe Levan&#39;s perception of Mithaecus&#39; skills was a bit inflated. Maybe not. 

Mithaecus put the kachapuri in the oven and Levan decided to ignore the very disturbing part about him having to go on a strict diet.

&quot;So when will it be ready?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 23, 2023 7:00 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mithaecus stepped away from the stove, conjuring a kitchen stool and sitting on top of it. He was much more comfortable sitting on his own conjured furniture. 

&quot;Hmmm... Magic isn&#39;t the right word, but something like that I suppose. It is second nature to me, the ability to conure ingredients. Perhaps a gift from the gods. But at any time I can create any ingredient or cooking supply I may need. That includes an entire kitchen if I have to.&quot;

&quot;It should be ready in about ten minutes. The one thing I can&#39;t do is expedite the cooking process, unfortunately. It&#39;s a delicate combination of chemical reactions that even I cannot fully comprehend.&quot;

Standing off the stool Mithaecus would approach Levan, gabbing his hand and pulling his arm to the side. Mithaecus analyzed his body once again, this time using his fingers to judge Levan&#39;s muscle mass. 

&quot;In the meantime tell me about yourself. We have yet to make a proper introduction&quot;

He knew that Sicilians and Italians in general were very tactile people and he didn&#39;t mind too much the whole kissing on the cheeks thing (no but for real, what a weird way to greet someone).

&quot;My name is Levan. I&#39;m twenty-three years old. I work for the Roman Catholic Church as a Knight even though sometimes I feel more like I&#39;m in the army or something.&quot;

It was all basic information and the young man guessed that Mithaecus was more interested in knowing what kind of Master he had to work with instead.

&quot;I summoned you because I want to win the Holy Grail War. I&#39;m not sure yet how I would phrase my, you know, wish, but I know that if... -- no, I know that <em>when</em> I have the Chalice in my hands, I will bring it back with me here in Vatican City because it is a sacred relic for us Christians and retrieving holy items is part of my job. Might get a raise. Love raises.&quot; 

Now that he was saying all this out loud, he felt more and more embarrassed. He now could fully realized that he had decided on a whim to participate in this conflict between mages because he wanted to prove to himself that he was capable of making his own decisions. It sounded like the motivations of a rebellious and stupid adolescent in a cheesy fantasy movie and Levan felt like vanishing. The part about collecting the Grail was fine though. 
But hey, might as well go on and be completely honest while he is at it and be done with it.

&quot;So, here goes. I feel like I was very lucky that you responded to my call, but on the other hand, truth is you pulled one of the worst Masters possible. I am indecisive and sometimes I can be a bit cowardly. I hate to fight and even more to get hurt and, to top it all off, as you can see I&#39;m not a magician at all. Don&#39;t have any magic wand or magic broom or magic grimoire. So, I&#39;m sorry? Nice to meet you though.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Satisfied with his findings, Caster would step back to let his master finish explaining himself. Levan&#39;s occupation didn&#39;t mean much to the Greek. The church wouldn&#39;t begin to get it&#39;s grip on the world till almost six hundred years after Mithaecus&#39;s death. What Mithaecus did know, was that Levan was without a goal. He wanted to get the Grail just to hand it over for a raise? Ridiculous. Not only did Levan lack a goal, he was also a self proclaimed coward. 

There was an awkward silence in the room as Mithaecus buried his face into his palms. Slowly his shoulders would buck up and down, a quaint noise following. After a few moments it would become apparent that Mithaecus was laughing. It started as a chuckle but quickly grew into hysterical laughter. The servant took a moment to calm himself down, catching up with his breathing. 

&quot;You mean to tell me that if you got the Grail, you would hand it over?&quot; Another chuckle left Caster&#39;s lips. &quot;You could have anything you want, but instead you would remain a slave to your work? Are there no greater goals you posses?&quot; Mithaecus inhaled deeply finally gathering his wits. 

He continued to inquire about Levan as he paced to the oven. &quot;I don&#39;t really care about you being the worst, or cowardly. It is problematic sure. But as I&#39;ve previously said, If you&#39;re willing to work with me it will be fine. We will start a strict diet and training regiment tomorrow morning. You may not be a magus, but you have something the others don&#39;t... Me! With a well catered diet, your physical attributes will be able to stand up to anyone.&quot;

Mithaecus would break from his speech, opening the oven and pulling out the dish he promised Levan. He conjured a wooden board to place the food onto, then placing the board onto the nearest table. &quot;Now then eat up! It is your last meal before we begin our diet after all!&quot;

He expected him to mock him and certainly not to decide to overlook the Master&#39;s shortcomings without even getting a bit angry. Levan found it hard to believe that Mithaecus could make him into someone who could &quot;stand up to anyone&quot; with just good food and physical activity but it was true that he had let himself go a bit lately because of the holiday season and it couldn&#39;t possibly be of any harm for him to go for a run. 

&quot;A diet and training... again, huh. Well, that&#39;s only fair. I&#39;ll be in your care so please, go easy on me.&quot; 

The khachapuri was ready. It smelled good and the golden color of the bread and cheese looked perfect. There even was an egg. The dough had been kneaded just right into a perfect boat shape, which was impressive considering it could only have been Mithaecus&#39; first time making this recipe. 

After hastily saying grace, Levan tore off a piece of bread from the edge and dipped it into the filling in the center. Bringing it to his mouth, he nearly burned himself. He repeatedly blew on it to cool the food and began to eat with appetite without further ado.

&quot;Hm! It&#39;s good! It really is! Man! You made it perfectly. How did you know what cheese to use?&quot; 

He motioned for Mithaecus to help himself and eat with him.

&quot;Oh! How rude of me. I had assumed you already knew who I was!&quot; Caster had assumed that Levan knew who he was based of the conversations they had about food. Levan was so quick to shower the chef in compliments that he had lost any real sense of the matter at hand.

The power that comes with knowing which cheese goes with which dish, it was almost too great it was frightening. If used for evil... better not think about it. 
But in any case, since the Greek showed no sign of wanting to help himself, Levan hurriedly ate what was left of the dish -- it was a crime to let that delicious bread and cheese get cold. 
Shoving a final piece of bread with filling into his mouth, he finished the kachapuri, apparently the last caloric dish Mithaecus would allow him to eat. What a shame... but again, wanting everybody in the world to get on the most balanced diet stemmed from pure, benevolent feelings, no? To see everyone be healthy. The big guy looked smart and like he knew what he was doing, so there was no sense questioning the &quot;greatest chef to ever live&quot;&#39;s judgement on that matter. 

&quot;Thanks for the food. That was great... Better than my mom&#39;s, that&#39;s for certain. Oop, you don&#39;t tell her I said that, okay?&quot;

The Knight wiped his hands on a napkin and got up from his chair to help the cook clean before drowsiness settled in. 

&quot;OK. Let&#39;s do the dishes and then go to bed. I&#39;ll try and see if there are any blankets for you. And clothes, although... Yeah.&quot; 

It could get quite cold at night this time of year. Mithaecus appearance was going to be a problem. He was still half-naked, and Levan didn&#39;t know where to dig up clothes that would accommodate his massive size. This made him realize that he didn&#39;t know how he was going to get out of the city without anyone seeing him followed by Mithaecus, let alone how he was going to get to Egypt. Flying? Levan had a little bit of money saved up, but would it be enough for two plane tickets? And again, would a singular plane sit be big enough for Mithaecus?

&quot;Hey, Mithaecus. I don&#39;t suppose you got any magic spell in your book to... teleport? To teleport us, like, a continent away from here?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, March 31, 2023 4:32 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of course it was great, no house wife could stand up to the cooking prowess of the best chef to ever live. It should go without saying that anyone would pale in comparison to Mithaecus&#39;s greatness.

As Levan offered to help with the dishes he would be met with silence. The vessel that the food was cooked in would disappear, as would the dish that Levan ate from. Everything was made from Mithaecus&#39;s mana and as such the constructs disappeared. 

&quot;Clothing? Hmmm, I certainly wouldn&#39;t be opposed to doing some fashion shopping. I do consider myself quite fashionable, and a nice body needs to be shown off in all the right ways.&quot; Mithaecus puffed out his chest, flexing his muscles as he fawned over his own physique. The prospect of picking up new clothes was exciting, although his taste would probably run Levan&#39;s wallet into the ground.

&quot;A different continent?&quot; Mithaecus recoiled in confusion unsure of why they&#39;d have to visit another such a distant place. Had he been summoned to the wrong place? It seemd as though Casters master was excluding important information. &quot;I can&#39;t do anything of the sort. Why do you ask?&quot;
