Was good at first, but eventually bills piled up. Was forced to take up a second job as a power station operative in his 30s, upping his total work hours to around 60 a week. Loving wife, but no kids. Doctors said that he was sterile.

His life was dull. Boring, even. But Hassan didn&#39;t let it put him down. After all, Berenice was a beautiful place to live in. None of those noisy Aswan roads or confusing modern terms. He felt at peace there, accepted and part of a community. Even better was the fact that it was a holiday. Not of the state, but one that he had received for excellent service the past two weeks. His wife seemed unnaturally sleepy, so he decided to head over to the bar and meet up with some of his regular friends.

&quot;Well, guess they&#39;ll just let anyone in these days!&quot; Kareem Laribi chuckled, sipping from his giant glass covered in beer and foam. He was one of Hassan&#39;s good friends, being the one who assisted him in plucking fruit during the harvest season. Both of them were cut from the same cloth, having had the same babysitter as kids. Kareem worked as a welder for some car company, meaning that he had to take the ferry to Aswan daily. Because of this, he had started to catch some modern traits that Hassan wasn&#39;t a fan of, but he wasn&#39;t nasty enough to put him down because of that.

<em>&quot;Wa alaikum al-salam!&quot;</em> Hassan replied, greeting his brother and heading to the bartender to order a drink. The tavern was packed, which meant that at most it housed around a dozen or so people. Berenice was a small, isolated community. People either came and left or stayed for the remainder of their life. The building&#39;s structure reinforced that, being antiquated and made of stone. A certain rustic charm that only those of a certain age might have been able to appreciate.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609507883196506 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609507883196506><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Hassan came back in a minute, a beer in hand as he took a seat at Kareem&#39;s table.

&quot;How is it going, brother? It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve talked!&quot; Kareem asked, enthusiastic.

&quot;It has, it has! But you know, same old, same old. They had me work on extra shifts the past 2 weeks. It was tough, but I managed to get it all sorted. Gave me a two day holiday as compensation.&quot; Hassan smiled and took a sip.

&quot;Only two days? Gee, how stingy. My boss was so happy with my work that I&#39;ve been given a month&#39;s paid leave. I think he hinted at a promotion as well.&quot; Kareem replied, exuding confidence.

&quot;Haha. That&#39;s nice.&quot; Hassan suddenly felt a lot less impressed by his own achievements. &quot;I&#39;m glad Aswan is treating you well, at least. My wife visited once and has never stopped nagging about how noisy it is.&quot; Hassan snickered.

&quot;Ah, I can imagine. Your wife has been nagging a lot recently. She&#39;s probably just annoyed you don&#39;t keep her much company, Hassan.&quot; Kareem huffed, then grunted. Something about Hassan&#39;s problems filled him with glee. &quot;How&#39;s stuff with the power station? Ever since, you know-&quot;

&quot;Dreadful. Don&#39;t even ask about it.&quot; Hassan replied with a half-hearted laugh. &quot;I mean, of course you can ask, but it&#39;s not pleasant. Just a lot of reprimands, new procedures and they are asking me to send them measurements every few hours. Can&#39;t even read a book in peace no more.&quot;

&quot;You read?&quot;

&quot;Do I look like I don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t mean to offend, pal.&quot; Kareem backed off. &quot;Just didn&#39;t think you&#39;d find the appeal since, you know, you live in-&quot;

&quot;There you go with that خرة again, Kareem.&quot; Hassan replied with a harrumph. &quot;Aswan got you thinking about all sorts of stupid nonsense. Berenice is calm and quiet, not noisy like your precious city. Lots of cheerful, good natured people in this community. My wife calls me a dolt every day, but she loves me dearly. You see, you&#39;d understand if you-&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609550413435043 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609550413435043><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;If I had a wife? If I settled down? Piss off with that, Hassan. That&#39;s not the life for me.&quot; Kareem slithered out of the pan. &quot;Being stuck with a woman who drags me down sounds like torture. I&#39;d rather enjoy my youth.&quot;

&quot;Of course you&#39;d say that. You&#39;re only 30 after all.&quot; Hassan laughed. &quot;Once you get a bit older, you&#39;ll understand the comfort of having someone alongside you.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully it won&#39;t be that sheep of your wife.&quot; Kareem howled, as if he had just said the funniest thing known to man. Hassan gave a faint smile, but it was out of politeness more than anything else. &quot;I prefer a more refined type of woman, Hassan. A more modest type.&quot;

Kareem&#39;s eyes had shifted, back towards the bartender. Hassan noticed and followed the trail, eventually coming across a familiar figure. Black, white and shrouded: It was none other than Sister Rosula, covered by her nun garments as she chatted with the bartender. Most likely requesting a delivery for the church. She wasn&#39;t the type to spend the night at the church&#39;s nearest tavern, but was considered a regular face due to the frequency of her orders. An elusive figure, she went by many nicknames at the tavern.

&quot;Look at Sister Rosula here, the epitome of modesty. Barely showing any skin, quick to work and always helpful. Even better: She&#39;s Aswan born. That&#39;s practically nobility around these parts.&quot; Kareem whispered, sounding lovestruck.

&quot;But my parents are from Aswan-&quot;

&quot;Well, you aren&#39;t a woman.&quot; Kareem rolled his eyes, then went back to gawking at Rosula. &quot;She comes here at least twice a week. Do you know how many eyes she attracts during her brief stay? Dozens. Do you know how many are in the tavern right now, Hassan? Dozens.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t really notice her until-&quot;

&quot;&#39;Cause you can barely get your thing up in the first place, Hassan.&quot; Kareem gestured around his groin, sending a message. &quot;Meanwhile, Rosula here has boys in their 20s getting excited. You hear me? In their 20s!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609595326050357 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609595326050357><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Brother, isn&#39;t that sinful to have impure thoughts about a nun?&quot;

&quot;Well, not like she&#39;s pure in the first place. Apparently she only became one &#39;cause her husband died and she&#39;s never recovered from it. Ya ask me, she just hasn&#39;t found the right type of man since. No wonder you&#39;d become a nun after that.&quot; Kareem spewed more wild theories as he took another sip from his drink. One couldn&#39;t tell if the passionate speech was due to inebriation or not.

&quot;...I&#39;m telling you, if she got to know me, she&#39;d quit being a nun in a heartbeat...&quot; He said with a verbal tic.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, brother. I get the feeling she would break you in two.&quot; Hassan replied with a look of bewilderment.

The two kept their conversation private while Rosula continued her order. Once she was done, she wasted no time in leaving, narrowly making it through the doorframe with her built stature. While the door hung open, one could notice a faint figure right next to her, short and frail. The noise of wheels turning could also be heard as she disappeared in the evening night.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Kareem asked, standing up to catch a closer view, but the door had already closed by then.

&quot;Who? Rosula. The nun you&#39;ve been ogling for the past five minutes.&quot; Hassan said, sounding a bit disgusted.

&quot;No, there was someone else. Someone short, like a kid. That can&#39;t be right though.&quot; Kareem covered his chin with his palm, deep in thought.

&quot;Huh? Well, she was married, right?&quot;

&quot;The kid&#39;s gone too though. Her entire family is.&quot; Kareem replied. &quot;You...Don&#39;t think she found someone else already?&quot;

&quot;I think you had too much to drink! Sit down, brother.&quot; Hassan ordered. Kareem scowled, but obeyed all the same.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609636300214332 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609636300214332><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;You&#39;re such a boor, Hassan. No wonder the power went down with you at the helm.&quot;

&quot;What was that?&quot; For the first time, the middle aged man looked offended. &quot;Say that again, Kareem.&quot;

&quot;Do I need to? It was all on the news, wasn&#39;t it? World breaking records like fifty percent down on electricity, people stuck in trains and so on. That&#39;s your line of work, isn&#39;t it? Or do you just sit there twiddling your thumbs while the power station burns down?&quot; Kareem&#39;s voice sounded a lot more venomous.

&quot;You bumbling oaf, do I look like Mohamed Maher Abaza to you?!&quot; Hassan slammed his glass down the table. &quot;My boss called me on that day. We don&#39;t know what happened yet. It wasn&#39;t even a grid failure, that&#39;s too simple. The TV was back on in hours and it was playing <em>Bakkar™️!&quot;</em>

&quot;Oh boy, didn&#39;t know Hassan graduated with a degree in engineering! Didn&#39;t they only grab you because you had experience sticking forks in outlets and living to tell the tale?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need a degree to be able to tell that! It&#39;s so simple: A power grid failure would have lasted more than a few hours. We&#39;re talking days, weeks. A state of emergency. Instead, it came back up in a few hours, as if something had taken it and then given it back away. But therein lies the second problem: If the power grid had <em>too</em> much power, it should have overheated and blown up as well. But that didn&#39;t happen either. It is a mystery!&quot; 

Hassan was shouting, but his mind felt crystal clear. Synapses and neurons conjoined together into a way that he had never felt before. He was never bright, nor perceptive. But right now, he felt powerful. He felt like he was seeing a whole new view of the world.

&quot;Good job, Einstein.&quot; Kareem taunted, clapping his hands. &quot;You really showed me with those words of yours. Too bad you couldn&#39;t solve the problem back then, when the power went down.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609677349863545 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609677349863545><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 12:59 PM">12:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Kareem,&quot; Hassan looked solemn. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I couldn&#39;t have done anything. It&#39;s not my fault you lost your job.&quot;

Kareem remained silent. His heart palpitated. His hands trembled. &quot;...What? What do you mean I lost-&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t get a month paid leave, did you? You got fired. Because your tools weren&#39;t working on that day. You messed up an important job and your boss had enough of it, because you were a lazy, incompetent buffoon who only went to Aswan to ogle at the women and jerk off to nuns on the side.&quot; Hassan said all of that with a straight face.

&quot;W-What? How dare-&quot; Kareem coughed. &quot;How do you even know th-&quot; 

&quot;I mean, it&#39;s in plain sight isn&#39;t it?&quot; Hassan reinforced. &quot;The way you held your cup showed that you were frustrated, the way you talked about your paid leave was an obvious lie. Your hand was in your pants while we were talking about Rosula and you immediately brought up the power station because it scarred you so deeply that you can never stop thinking about it.&quot;

&quot;....I.&quot; Kareem uttered, sweating bullets at Hassan&#39;s statements. He had always seen him as a calm and dull middle aged man. Where were they getting that courage and knowledge from? Surface level actions were enough to give away his entire life story?!

But even more shocking was the fact that Kareem could <em>relate</em> to what Hassan was saying. He looked at his &#39;friend&#39; closely and noticed several imperfections. Wrinkly skin, bags under the eyes and a weak constitution. His brain matter started leaking from the inside.

&quot;...At least I&#39;m not as pathetic as you, Hassan.&quot; Kareem grumbled. &quot;You think I don&#39;t notice how your 2 weeks of overtime were <em>sleepless?</em> I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re still standing, really.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just a humble worker. I need to provide for me and my wife.&quot; Hassan spat back.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089609715971018822 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089609715971018822><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 1:00 PM">1:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Yes, your wife. Hassan, do you <em>really</em> know your wife? Do you know why she loves you so much, yet constantly feels sleepy anytime you invite her over to the tavern? It&#39;s not because of us: We couldn&#39;t care less to gawk at such an ugly whore.&quot;

&quot;You take that back, you foul-mouthed bastard.&quot; Hassan grabbed at the table&#39;s edges.

&quot;You can tell, can&#39;t you? You can probably even run back home and catch her in the act. You know how long it&#39;s been going on for, Hassan? Years.&quot; Kareem snickered.

&quot;I was her first-&quot;

<em><strong>&quot;SHUT UP KAREEM!&quot;</strong></em>

<em>CRASH!</em>

The glasses crashed as Hassan flipped the table over, using raw strength and anger to completely topple Kareem and crush him with the wooden surface. He then grabbed a shard of glass and immediately stabbed his friend in the eye with it. Kareem screamed.

The commotion finally attracted the attention of the bartender, who was horrified. Several other men joined in to separate the two, but would be surprised to see how violently they were assaulting each other. Insults were thrown and blood was spilled, all by two brothers who were often known as an inseparable couple back in Berenice.

The fighting continued for a bit, until the two collapsed, hugging in each other&#39;s arms. The island doctor was called, followed by an ambulance, but it was too late. Hassan and Kareem was no longer in this world. The cause of death was not due to the numerous slashes and bruises they had received, but something far more enigmatic. Supposedly, both of them had latent brain tumors that had only revealed themselves on that fateful evening. A bad omen.

Soon, a new job posting was put out for the role of <em>Power Station Assistant</em> back at Berenice. The tragedy was short lived as the island&#39;s inhabitants soon returned to their normal, idle lives. Sister Rosula was asked to assist with the funeral rites, but who knew if she would have enough time in her current state. After all, a war was coming.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
