It wasn&#39;t enough to simply say &#39;There&#39;s someone here at this shopping mall, let us kill them fast-like&#39;.  Assassin had to lead into it, layering dramatic effect to build up their arrival, disguising the location in mysterious but somewhat obvious guessing games, and presenting it with panache: a mid-range department store, one example of western influence encroaching on the tradition of the area.  It was huge in comparison to the smaller buildings, only years old compared to the very long history of some storefronts, and sat like a blight, separated from the rest of the world by an asphalt sea.

&quot;...some manner of <em>mercantile palace.</em>  Were it I who chose the venue, I&#39;d have chosen a graveyard to skip the fighting and fall right into death, saving us the trouble.&quot; The short Servant crept forward, foot behind foot, looking upon the unassuming exterior with a steady sense of anticipation.  The two of them had approached the war with haphazard intelligence, relying on personally searching the street of Berenice with their own senses; Triboulet chanced upon a single, telltale sign first, and drew James to it without much delay.

She held up a hand to the air, quaffing it to her nose as if she was a sommelier with fine wine: &quot;&#39;tis mana.  And...oddly enough...&quot;

She continued to visibly sniff the air, despite the potent likelihood that she couldn&#39;t really smell this sort of thing at all.  &quot;...more than I expected.  Even more.&quot;  Her already low hunch became a lower crouch.  &quot;If it is a Servant, it is one bleeding through mana with all abandon.  I could easily make a comment about letting loose with your bounty before you&#39;ve even come along, but I&#39;m a respectful...&quot;

Trailing off, she halted.  Her focus returned to the exterior of the building, and her cold eyes narrowed.  &quot;Strange.  Do you notice it, too?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094860899031982130 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094860899031982130><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 10, 2023 12:46 AM">12:46 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She exhaled, and looked intently upon the front doorways.

One cannot let their guard down around someone like Assassin, lest they fall victim to another one of her jokes or tricks. Nevertheless, this is something he cannot chance saying no to. An early pick might put them ahead, especially so if they haven&#39;t had time to set up at all. Best to play to their strengths, of course.

The sight of location wasn&#39;t so much of a surprise given Assassin&#39;s guessing games leading up to the place. The public factor might make it harder to get the jump on them, or easier. He doesn&#39;t really know honestly. Maybe he can blend into the crowd? That might work. As long as they can find them first. He hoped that their Servant stuck out just as much as his own did.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t you make the joke about them falling into their graves instead? I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;m being led to my death or not but I would like to be.&quot; Fortunately, James blended into the crowd as just another tourist. Perfect for a disguise in a location such as this! What luck! Only if there were actually people around to blend in <em>with</em>, of course.

&quot;Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.&quot; The eerie silence of what could be a busy entrance to the mall landed heavy upon his shoulders, threatening to weaken his resolve. &quot;Maybe people just are exiting through another entrance. These places do have multiple entrances, after all.&quot; At least, that is what he hoped for. 

&quot;Come on. The longer we wait, the more we stick out to anyone watching. Assassin, I want you to stay hidden and keep an eye out for what could be our target.&quot; With that, James headed inside to begin their hunt. &quot;If we can spot them first, we&#39;ll have the advantage.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095008256990122065 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095008256990122065><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 10, 2023 10:31 AM">10:31 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lindwyrm had not spent its idle time on purposeless activities, instead moving to address Ann’s primary concern when she had left to wander the mall by herself, that being the unbearable cold. In doing so it was also able to make ready the site at which their marriage ceremony was going to take place, though looking at it one would struggle to see how a nest was in any way, shape, or form related to a wedding.

Blankets and furs. Torn clothing and curtains. Lavish carpets in richly accented colors.
It would appear Lindwyrm had collected any and all materials it could use as bedding and used them to transform the site of its original impact, the massive crater existing at the very center of the mall, into what could only be described as a paradise of cuddly and cozy. There was no hard surface to be found anywhere in the nearly ten meter wide nest, layers upon layers of fabrics stacked over and under each other to ensure that even a reckless nose-dive into the heart of it would leave one perfectly unharmed, even if, purely aesthetically, it was a rather chaotic sight to behold. Expensive designer clothes had been ripped apart and harvested for their fur-lined collars and sleeves, artificial or not, and furniture had been stripped of its wood and wires until only left with its cushions and pillows. It was a nest big enough to support Lindwyrm in its entirety, and at its very center, a massive pyre of cardboard and wood had been erected… though it remained suspiciously unlit.

Much to Lindwyrm’s annoyance.

Though it possessed an unparalleled breath capable of freezing anything in its sight, producing heat was beyond it.
Growing increasingly more frustrated, its tail lashed out at the nearby storefronts and shattered them to pieces, high-pitched snarls threatening the improvised bonfire before it to burst into flames lest it share a similar fate. Circling outside the nest to spare the soft bedding the sharpness of its claws, its attention was fully on this single uncooperative hearth that was meant to warm its bride, unable to understand why it didn’t do as it was told. It had clawed at it, gnawed at it, and even thrown no small amount of kindling at it, yet when it had used <s>fake electric</s> candles and <s>toy</s> torches at it, it gave no response.

Lindwyrm roared as it shot another blast of ice into the ceiling, clearly not the first as a rather impressive chandelier had started to form from its previous fits of rage, before it began pacing around the nest once more after calming itself with a human meal, thus starting the futile repetitive circle all over again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Left to her own thoughts, Ann finally had time to digest what she had experienced over the past couple of hours as she made her way through the eerily silent and completely frozen department store. By summoning Lindwyrm on that plane and crashing into this place, she had probably killed close to a thousand people, and every frozen human being she passed in the stores reminded her of that fact. Old people, young men and women, children, some toddlers. None had been spared by the Lindwyrm. 

Did she feel bad about them? No, not really. Frankly, she couldn’t care less about people&#39;s stupid feelings or problems. What <em>she</em> wanted was far more important, and no matter what the consequences of her actions, she would do whatever it took to win. Finding an untouched parka in the back of a clothing store had evoked more feelings in her than passing a hundred of those human popsicles on her way.

She had been lucky with this find, but not so lucky with the food. It seemed that most of the ground floor mall had been destroyed and frozen by Lindwyrm. Her stomach rumbled grumpily as she made her way back upstairs to her Servant, a dissatisfied expression on her face as she thought back to their last conversation… but it was quickly supplanted by an amused smile as she noticed the, uh, cozy den that Lindwyrm had constructed inside the landing crater out of torn clothing and fake furs.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed, Lindy!&quot; she said as she approached the pit and looked at it from the edge. &quot;Damn, that actually looks pretty comfortable. Didn&#39;t think you had it in you to do something like that, I honestly thought you were only good at killing and freezing people to death.&quot;

Her attention was then drawn to the source of Lindwyrm&#39;s frustrations, the pile of rubble and wood that had been almost as uncooperative in lighting up as Ann herself. She looked at it funnily, not understanding its intended purpose for a good ten seconds, before another amused smile broke out on her face. She turned to Lindwyrm, pointing at it with one thumb.

“Is that what I think it is? There’s no way… right?”

She pulled out her zippo and crouched down in front of the first plywood and cardboard layers, igniting them with the flame. It took a few tries to get the fire going, but eventually the cardboard started to burn and the rest of the pile followed. She took a few steps back and dropped onto Lindwyrm&#39;s side and the furs underneath, almost using the dragon as a big pillow.

Night had fallen.
There were no more obstacles. No more distractions.

She had even dealt with the impossibly flame resistant pyre that had vexed it so.

The only thing that remained was a feast… and though Lindwyrm had eaten its fill, the potency of its Master’s vitality suggested that they were starved for energy. It would appear Ann had not found a meal to sate her, despite the abundance of human flesh that surrounded them, though as a human herself, it was possible that such meat was not to her liking.
Lindwyrm stayed still as Ann rested her body against its own, the earlier aggression it had shown the unlit fire giving way to the rhythmic rising and falling of its relaxing flank.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“You yet lack a banquet to quell thine appetite,”</code> Lindwyrm eventually grumbled with a slight degree of annoyance, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“I have neglected to consider your distaste for your own kind’s flesh,”</code> and it appeared it considered the blame to be its own.

A seemingly considerate notion perhaps, if it weren’t for the fact that, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Had I provided a fitting meal, our ceremony could have already been underway.”</code>

Of course that was the underlying motive behind the lonely serpent’s kindness.
As if it was allowed no other thought that could distract it from its goal.

Sulking about the delay it itself had caused, Lindwyrm flicked the tip of its tail in and out of the nearby flame, as if swatting away at the skyward embers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This would become slightly easier when she realized that it was one of those doors made to slide to the sides, but yet, it still didn&#39;t open for her.  Illuminated in the night by the light hanging above the entrance, the neon glow of the store&#39;s sign, she grumbled and took out a knife from under her cloak.  The door was wedged open by force, a snapping sound finally giving way inside.

The reason it was held shut was clear right afterward.  Laying along the ground on the other side was a human arm, given a deathly palor from the frost that enveloped it, and it was now snapped off from its owner who had desperately tried to leave the building.  Assassin held her breath, staring down at it...and then slowly turned her head upward.

The poor woman wasn&#39;t alone.  There were dozens, of all ages and kinds, each of them frozen mid-step in a permanent showing of their failure to leave at the very end.  A mother held her child between her arms, who looked like nothing more than a lump of snow from the bit of flesh that poked out from her now eternal embrace.  Past them, even more were left like this, some in a similar last-moment panic but many seemingly unaware of the death that was about to overtake them.  A man stood at a now completely iced over store window, pondering a purchase that he&#39;d never make.  Two children hopped down the escalator in apparent joy, one paradoxically hanging in mid-air without any means of remaining in place.

And it was all perfectly silent.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095777014381826239 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095777014381826239><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 1:26 PM">1:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet did not yet break that silence.

For what felt like a very long time, even if James had butted up against her and asked her to move along, she looked at the scene impassively.

Then, with a final exhalation, she adjusted her hat - her hand slightly shook as it reached up for the white fabric before she assertively pushed it into place.  <em>This should be reason enough to not worry about this Master&#39;s life.</em>  She ran inside, deft and quiet feet carrying her along, and Presence Concealment acting as her cloak, until she could find the source of this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, it was getting late. Perhaps they locked it earlier than he tho-

&quot;Dear God...&quot; The frozen nightmare before him was enough to bring a hand to cover his mouth, as if expecting for the smell to hit him, only for the cold breeze to brush over him instead. The amount of carnage and death formed a pit in his stomach. The moment his eyes fell upon a child was when James knew he had enough of the scene in front of him. He didn&#39;t need to know how many young lives were snuffed out from whatever caused this. 

His breathing became unsteady. The nerves were shot as he tried to get himself to calm down. Calm breaths. Keep a steady pace. One after the other. James did his best to move on beyond the scene with his eyes closed after Assassin ran on in, hoping that the memory of the scene wasn&#39;t going to be a permanent one. If only he could be so lucky.

<em>&#39;I understand...&#39;</em> Even through their link, his voice was shaken. This went beyond simply being green to death. The deaths held a more personal meaning to this man. <em>&#39;Remember. Either deal with the Servant, or hold out until <strong>I</strong> deal with the Master. The moment they realize our plan is the moment we lose.&#39;</em>

The presence of another still alive in the mall would be an odd one to sense indeed. However, with a Servant <em>this</em> powerful, hiding would be a damn near impossibility. That will be their edge in this engagement.

It wasn&#39;t difficult to find the source.  The damage focused on the center of it all, the light crackle of a fire and the faint scent of burning cardboard that was almost masked by the sheer cold burning her nose, she was able to catch and find the strange bed in the center.  And, more importantly, its resident.  

Were she perceptible right then, Assassin would&#39;ve seemed completely out of her element.  After all, who wouldn&#39;t?  It was enough to see death in amounts that she had only imagined up close, but then to find out its probable cause was...a <strong>dragon?</strong>  A real dragon?  An <em>entire</em> dragon?  Assassin&#39;s jaw dropped.  This sort of thing wasn&#39;t even meant to be a Servant, it was just a vile reptilian bundle of sin!  It became no question of why this many people were killed anymore, these sorts of things are bloodthirsty in their kindest forms - the natural nemesis of all Christians!  Briefly, she wondered if it wasn&#39;t even the Servant in question, as if a dragon had survived into the modern day somehow.  The taste in the air was almost burning with the mana the beast exuded, and she concluded that if it wasn&#39;t the Servant, its summoner was just as terrifying.  A dragon in the modern day - murderous, avaricious, rapacious, unquenchable in its inhuman desires!  And...

...they were strong.

All chivalric romances and tales of hearsay were very clear here.  A dragon was something far beyond her, and the sort of dragon that&#39;d become a legend in its own right...not just the obstacle for the stalwart iterant hero to overcome, but a being of renown...she wasn&#39;t going to kill it head-on.  It could&#39;ve been the Tarrasque of Provence for all she knew!  Were it just a matter of killing the Master...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096259373023633438 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096259373023633438><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 13, 2023 9:23 PM">9:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In her uncertainty, standing at the edge of the crater it made, she almost didn&#39;t notice the woman alongside it.

That&#39;s the kind of karmic fortune that you&#39;d see in a story, the almswoman gets the most terrible of beasts to protect her. She hardly seemed to carry herself like a beggar, though...and she was right there.  She briefly considered making it easier on everyone and simply trying to kill the damnable woman here and now, one knife to the spine would do it!  Just...

No one besides James would hear her swear.  <em>A thorn in my sole, you are!  Come now, you conscientious git, you&#39;ve got your target.

Those words inside of his head halted his progress through the frozen nightmare this mall became. Assassin found their target. James was tailing behind Assassin but he wasn&#39;t close enough to spot who their target was, nor the Servant they were in possession of. Away from the sights of the opposing pair, James slipped away into the halls of the store. Following the same path as Assassin would be suicidal. Another path was needed. 

<em>&#39;I&#39;ll leave it to you, Assassin. Put on a good show for us.&#39;</em> With those words, James slipped into the shadows of the winter wonderland to find another path towards them. There was no fear in his heart for Assassin&#39;s safety. No reason to believe that she wouldn&#39;t just fall dead to the enemy Servant&#39;s cold. Well, there was a <em>little</em> reason deep within. Assassin <em>did</em> like to joke around. What a cruel joke that would be to lie about her capabilities, after all...

With one of his Silver Nails in hand, held backwards for better concealment, crept ever closer to their target. The faint music, now increasing in volume with each step taken, took him that Assassin has already gotten to work. 

All he needed to do was to stay out of sight until the right moment showed itself...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096313654284144690 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096313654284144690><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 12:59 AM">12:59 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Whew...&quot; She let out a contented sigh, putting one leg over the other to make herself more comfortable. &quot;Why don&#39;t you worry about the meals and the ceremonies and whatever the hell tomorrow, Lindy? Let&#39;s just take it easy and relax tonight...&quot;

As if a switch had been flipped, Ann&#39;s exhaustion came crashing down on her. Her tense shoulders slumped, her jaw hung open, and her whole body relaxed as it finally found the rest it so desperately needed after everything it went through today. Yes... so relaxed in fact that it seemed Ann’s mind conjured a serene, quiet tone to help her further drift into unconsciousness…

Except it didn&#39;t. Ann&#39;s eyes peeled wide open, staring at the small figure towering over them from the edge of the crater, playing the melody that had nearly put her to sleep.

Rich vibrations, low notes, a steady, unruffled rhythm. An earthy, warm, almost vintage sound drowned her eardrums and covered her brain with a blanket of calm. Then the notes began to rise slightly, and the BPM increased accordingly, then came back down, and up again. The sounds went from low to high, fast to slow, the unpredictability keeping her on her toes and destabilizing the rhythm it had previously established. It was the jam of a hollow-bodied bass, hiding its madness and unpredictability under a false impression of calm and serenity, almost mocking the first notes it played.

Ann stood stunned for a moment, trying to make sense of the song playing in her ears, as she stared uncomfortably at the smiling jester. After the initial shock wore off, confusion set in, and then questions arose. Who was this person? What were they doing here? Why were they playing an instrument? <em>How come they don&#39;t feel human?</em>

&quot;Didn&#39;t you get the memo?&quot; Ann asked loudly over the music, rising from Lindwyrm&#39;s side, her relaxed body becoming alert. &quot;Tonight&#39;s ceremony has been postponed, you should come back another day.&quot;

Ann turned her head to Lindwyrm, speaking in a low voice.

<strong>&quot;Maul her down.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lindwyrm stirred and rose itself from where it had served as Ann’s cushion, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Who. A minstrel that has lost their way?”</code> and faced their uninvited guest

Should they be willing to contribute to their wedding then all would be well. They appeared harmless enough, even if the scent of their magical energy seemed particularly <s>delicious</s> potent in comparison to the middling civilians Lindwyrm had devoured thus far, but all would change with the command issued by its very own Master.

Maul. Destroy. Devour.

Her simple directive was twisted by violent urge, territorial instinct and bestial aggression the fuel that fed Lindwyrm’s flame.
Wasting no time it leapt from its nest in a single motion, the sheer force of the act tossling the chaotic pile of pillows and blankets, using its wings to correct its course midair. Its fangs were bared, its claws spread. There was no elegance in its charge, no control. With the force of an out-of-control train barrelling aimlessly towards its target, Lindwyrm’s body descended upon Triboulet with unchecked ferocity.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With Lindwyrm set upon her like a rabid dog, facing down danger as terrible as her mind could imagine - worse, because she <em>still</em> didn&#39;t expect to come across a goddamned <em>dragon</em> - Triboulet felt a feeling rush through her body, from chest to extremities, that could only be described as electric.  Fear, intense at that...but <em>excitement</em> all the same.  In that brief moment, standing there and playing a pair of notes while Lindwyrm threw its huge mass in her direction, she felt completely alive!

She turned tail at just the last moment, a backing step followed by a knife thrown at Ann&#39;s direction, and then a sprint.  The knife wasn&#39;t aimed with intent to kill, maybe just a scratch is all, but most likely it&#39;d embed itself in the tiles behind their adhoc chamber and give her a good spook.  To give a rabbit to chase is goodly, but to give a threat to pursue is better!

Turning on her back heel to face forward, once she stopped playing her tune, she moved with incredible speed!  Easily outpacing the violent thrashing of her pursuer, she gave every ounce of effort into running with the same grace as she exhibited before, only at a pace that was far beyond that of a human.  One second she was there in the moonlight with Berserker and its Master, another, she had departed.

But she absolutely did not let herself become hidden.  Cranking her <em>vielle &#224; roue</em> with ferocity, the song picking up a dire tempo, she left a siren trail of music to keep the dragon&#39;s attention...as well as plain old mockery.  &quot;Come on, lizard!&quot;  She hopped over a display rack of clothing, not so much as jingling the hangers with her passing.  &quot;You&#39;re a lizard, but do you wish to be a laggard, too?  Give us a show!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097006319816429681 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097006319816429681><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 10:51 PM">10:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her goal was to bring the Berserker out from the center of the store and toward the edge, going up a frozen escalator to bring them to the electronics and appliances department.

Sparing not even a glance at the wayward knife thrown by its prey, the mere fact that she was ‘prey’ was enough for Lindwyrm to blindly trash towards her in a clumsy effort to catch up to a target several times more nimble than itself.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“A bite?”</code> it repeated after Triboulet’s taunt, oblivious to the mocking nature of her jeers, the sound of its rumbling belly easily mistaken for a hungry growl, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“If you are to be my meal, then why do you continue to-”</code>

Its words were suddenly interrupted as it was a step away from catching up to the seemingly willing snack, waiting for it atop the frost-glazed escalators. Though the mall was vast, for a being of its prestigious size, it didn’t quite allow for it to spread itself to its full size, especially after having moved away from the main atrium and being lured into the noticeably more cramped subsections. Lindwyrm’s wings were next to useless in this environment, forced to crawl and slither on the ground like a snake, an act that came to it naturally, but one that nevertheless limited the speed at which it could travel.

For something of its size to be traveling as fast as it did, it was obvious that an ordinary escalator would be unable to bear the crushing force exerted by its clawed limbs, causing the mechanical structure to screech and buckle the moment it was stepped on and cause Lindwyrm to trip headfirst into the floor below Triboulet as its momentum carried it horizontally forwards rather than upwards as it intended.

An almost comical amount of debris exploded out from below Triboulet, made all the more absurd by the fact she couldn’t even see the mess herself, her vision blocked by the floor, leaving her to guess at the clattering mess of what couldn’t possibly have been conveniently placed pots and pans, perhaps even the inexplicable yelp of a cat, before silence returned to the mall to sell the moment.

This dragon… surely wasn’t purposefully seeking to outdo her as a buffoon, did it?

As if to dispel this ridiculous notion, a sudden tremor rocked the floor Triboulet stood upon. An anvil receiving the hammer’s blows from below. Electing to take the shortest route, Lindwyrm threw its body against the ceiling with such force that it violently erupted from the ground, slightly disoriented by the act, and wildly clawing into all directions to compensate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Full of contempt, she put a hold on her song and gave him a peal of laughter that was all but muted over the crunch and squeal of many thousands of dollars worth of machinery.  Thankfully, once things came to clattering rest, her merriment was heard loud and clear.

&quot;Haggard dullard laggard lizard,&quot; she shouted down at the pile of debris, punctuated by a perfectly placed and somewhat familiar-sounding piece of pottery shattering somewhere, &quot;that&#39;s why I run!  To burn a bit of your gut off!  Must&#39;ve supped on many a princess to get THIS fat!  Now, how about another lap arou--&quot;

Assassin was looking down at the poor thing when it suddenly shot out from the rubble and up <em>right into her face.</em>  She had a brief window to jump backward, and this quite possibly saved her from just being killed by the sheer force right then and there - or perhaps it was the comedic timing of being interrupted like that, what gave her reprieve.  It will remain a mystery.  Assassin landed on her back a good distance away, clocked but not taken out by a piece of drywall sent skyward by the dragon - and thankfully <em>just</em> spared his claws.  She watched as one passed over her prone body by mere inches, kept from bisecting her by pure luck.

Successive crashes echoed through the wide room as the shrapnel of the collision broke against televisions and knocked them free of their shelves, acrid electronic smoke joining the dust and the frost&#39;s scent.  Assassin pulled herself back to her feet with an acrobatic leap and shouted &quot;Work on your form, you&#39;ll make a good swimmer in no time!&quot;

She ran deeper into the aisles, hoping that Lindwyrm&#39;s blind fury would give her a few seconds to make herself hidden...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You had to be insane, or stupid, to not feel at least some fear after seeing something like that, especially after how it thrashed around chasing after Assassin. That was something he had to give Assassin credit for; she didn&#39;t buckle under the fear.

After she took the show, along with the dragon, away from them, James made his move. He took note of the knife thrown. That would be much more effective than his Silver Nails, if he can get to it, of course. As much as he wanted to, he needed to make the first strike count.

James counted on the false sense of security seeing your Servant chase away the would-be threat to make getting behind her possible. Thankfully, the bedding beneath him softened his steps, allowing him to get just that much closer before any sound would give him away.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think that would actually work. Maybe your Servant isn&#39;t as smart as we thought it was!&quot; Suddenly, a second voice broke the growing silence as the two Servants raged through the halls of the department store. It came from behind her as James had his hand reeled back in an attempt to stab her with what seems like a large acupuncture needle. He couldn&#39;t have brought a regular knife with him?! The unknown assailant seemed to have been keeping watch of Ann and Berserker for awhile it seems.

This little woman, whoever she was, looked at best like some kind of medieval minstrel, and Ann didn&#39;t expect her to have a knife on her. Even a seasoned brawler like her barely reacted when the knife was thrown at her. In a mixture of blind luck and an Assassin who didn&#39;t intend her attack to be deadly, the knife narrowly missed her face and cut through her cheek before planting itself on the bedding behind her with a hollow thud. Ann&#39;s breath was taken away.

Lindwyrm then took flight and carried out her command to attack the intruder, lifting the blankets and furs all around Ann with its violent leap and heavy wingbeats. Ann finally breathed out the tension caused by the thrown knife, running her hand over the gash left on her face, blood seeping onto her fingers and palm. The warmth of her blood gave her pause, and some comfort in the icy hell that Lindwyrm had created. Her body was in panic mode when she heard the sounds of walls breaking and ice shattering as Lindwyrm chased the intruder into the depths of the store.

Ann quickly grabbed her Wondergirl bat from the gig bag on her back, arming herself in case the knife-throwing minstrel came back. But she didn&#39;t have time to rest when a second voice, deep and somewhat coarse, sounded behind her. She barely had time to turn around before the large needle was jabbed into her side, a high-pitched scream leaving her lips as she jumped back to get away from the danger. The large parka she wore to protect herself from the cold worked in her favor, making her true figure unclear and ambiguous, which meant that James&#39; stab wound didn&#39;t go through as much flesh as he initially judged.

&quot;Son of a bitch!” Ann pressed her left hand to her bloody side, painful moans mixed with huffs of anger punctuating her words. &quot;Guhh... stabbed me in the fucking side.&quot;

She lifted her eyes from the floor, resting them on her attacker. Her gaze was hard, her eyelids half closed and the skin around her eyes taught and wrinkled with irritation. She was not happy with the way things were going, and she looked genuinely confused at how she could bleed from two different places on her body in less than twenty seconds. The long needles in the old man&#39;s hands explained the second wound, but not what he was doing here. Was he with the jester from earlier?

&quot;What’s your fucking problem, Grandpa!&quot; She yelled, gripping the bat tighter in her right hand. “Couldn’t you take the fucking hint when you saw all the frozen corpses on your way up? Go away!!”

She kicked the ground angrily and ran towards him, clutching her bat in both hands as she was about to hit a home run with the man&#39;s head...

But she changed her stance at the last second, sending her arms back and her leg forward in a violent front kick into the man&#39;s torso.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His strike didn&#39;t strike as much as he figured it would. Well, it isn&#39;t like he was used to fighting so he could give himself some slack. Still, the amount of blood on his Silver Nail meant that it was a decent wound.

&quot;Those bodies were what allowed us to find you actually.&quot; His grip on his weapon was adjusted. The drops of blood slowly but surely staining the ground beneath them. &quot;Giving yourself away like that just makes you an easy target.&quot; Calm. He had to remain calm. That missed attack was bugging him, though. He was such a fool for missing that! 

His eyes studied her body before he did anything else. The ways she breathed, and moved her body, allowed him to pinpoint various Qi points across her body. If he can&#39;t go in for the kill, then he can just begin to lock down her circuits. That&#39;ll shut down any Magecraft of hers! Or at least hamper it.

In the time he spent studying, Ann took the initiative and struck back. James, unfortunately, was a rookie when it came to these kind of brawls. So, predictably, he ducked. Then the hard strike of her kick forced the wind of his lungs as he was sent off his feet back, thanks to his unbalanced position from ducking.

&quot;Shit...&quot; The man cursed through his teeth as he propped himself up using his elbows and hands. Once he got himself up, his hand went behind his back. &quot;Where do you get off calling me a Grandpa? I&#39;m not even in my forties yet!&quot; <s>Next year he will be in his forties, but that&#39;s besides the point.</s> Swiftly, James revealed his hand and another needle was tossed at her. The pointed tip gleamed in the light of the mall as it flew towards its target.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097297058584600627 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097297058584600627><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 6:06 PM">6:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
