She had worked her hardest to be able to stomach killing should she be required to do so. After arriving in Cairo she wasted absolutely no time boarding the first train she could to the fateful island on the nile, It would be a long and boring journey of course taking nearly 10 hours by car - trains would obviously complete the trip at greater pace however the journey would still be a 5-6 hour slug of boredom for her. Thankfully due to her only being particularly well known in Toulouse and some areas of London as a musician she was mostly left alone where people simply didnt know her. Although she did have one encounter pretty early on in the journey with a rather passionate Young man whom was clearly also a foreigner to this nation he asked her a few questions proclaimed his support for her music and then left her alone. She attempted to keep her creative mind occupied, she had brought with her some music sheets and pencils should she brainstorm anything particularly creative she could get it down on paper before she forgot. Her efforts were in vain however constantly she was struggling to remain awake as the steel beast charged forward. She had with her a rather peculiar assortment of several guitars to which she was only questioned about on the one occasion when boarding. She spent the last few hours very much asleep and found herself being rudely awakened by the conductor whom was hurrying everybody off the train several minutes after arrival on the island.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085097003706486794 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085097003706486794><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 2:08 AM">2:08 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>That was it! She had arrived upon the unfortunate island that would soon serve as a bloody battlefield for the savagery of the Holy Grail War. She wondered around aimlessly building up one hell of a sweat with her suitcase and three guitars strapped to her back looking for wherever it was she had arranged for her accommodation to be. After around only thirty minutes of searching she located the Hotel she had booked to stay in for at least the first few days, she didn&#39;t expect combat to occur amongst masters until it had been announced everyone had arrived, however that does not rule out the possibility. After unpacking her things and setting up the barriers and defences she had been taught by her parents and tutors she headed out to look around the market for some form of liquid source she could construct her summoning circle with. She spotted a rough looking market stall selling fruits one had chickens for purchase another was selling trinkets and keyrings to tourists then her eyes gazed upon a more established looking building, The walls were very clean almost a bleached white it had an electric sign, automatic doors and was rather large in its stature, it appeared to be a supply shop for chemists in schools. She pondered whether they&#39;d have anything interesting in there. After further investigation she found a flask of mercury - she didn&#39;t remember needing mercury when she was in education she thought it was rather weird although foreign countries will have different education programmes. She left the building and headed back to her lavish hotel room, the room itself was decorated with luxurious furniture of a grey velvet, the room had very cleanly polished vibe to it and the bed was comfier than anything she had ever slept on before, it was so comfy that after she got back and laid down she passed out in mere minutes, only to awake at an ungodly hour of the night, the perfect time for some shenanigans.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The wind had picked up so the space would require shielding from the wind to ensure there is no interference with the circle. AHA she found it a lovely little spot just past an alleyway walled off with almost no wind. &quot;this&#39;ll do excellently!!&quot; she decreed in a thick French accent, She began to construct the circle first engraving it&#39;s shape and form into the floor to prevent the mercury just rolling off everywhere. The mercury then filled the dips in the floor running around them like a beautiful dance she placed her piece of Heracles bow in the centre and stepped back as the mercury continued to fill the circle, It&#39;s motion ceased. &quot;It&#39;s time&quot; she solemnly declared.
2:23am
She began her Incantation:

By the power of the mystic arts and ancient lore, 
I call upon the epic spirits of days since past
I summon a grand hero of legends told
I call to thee through time and space to serve my will and obey my faith
With the power of my command and the bond of magic
With the strength of your heart come forth and play your part
Heed my will and reason, answer my call and together we shall forge our destiny still
Hero of legend I summon thee now, do come forth into the world of the now

An immense flash of bright light emerged from the circle as Charlotte stood over it her hand out as she awaited the arrival of an epic warrior she would attempt to form a lasting bond with.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seemed as though the ritual could not have gone more swimmingly. The Holy Grail was properly answering to her joville call, and drafting a Servant based on the catalyst she provided.

Her background was meager, but her enthusiasm was not. Through one way or another, the heir to the Cadieux family managed to procure a powerful catalyst. Fragmented it may be, that small shard was all the Grail needed to track down the desired Heroic Spirit.

Greece’s Greatest Hero, Heracles.

Any Master would be hard-pressed to name a more trustworthy Servant to summon. Her victory might as well have been guaranteed with someone like that by her side, regardless of what Class he was summoned under.

… Though, of course, it wouldn’t be so simple, would it?

Perhaps a fragment was not enough to reliably invoke the hero. Or perhaps she had been scammed into a faulty artifact. Or maybe the Heroic Spirit Summoning Ritual’s inconsistencies veered the summoning off-course. Whatever the case may be, the one to answer Charlotte’s call wasn’t the Strongest.

As the light and wind faded, the figure of a captivating black-haired man emerged from the middle. He seemed eerily relaxed whilst bathing in the leftover mana from the ritual and regaining his five senses.

He was strong. Looking at any part of his body, and even an amateur could tell that much. Even amongst well-trained, battle hungry Greek warriors, the emerging Archer’s body stood out from the crowd. But that was only a matter of physical fitness. If looking at nothing but his calm, idle stance, he… didn’t seem scary whatsoever.

The warrior in front of her exuded none of the sheer might one might expect out of Heracles.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085588307964067992 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085588307964067992><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 10:40 AM">10:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Only after the ritual came to a complete close and the contract between the two of them became certain did the young man slowly open his eyes. More than his sight though, he first decided to focus on the wind.

“Air’s grown a weird scent since when I was alive. Smells a little bit burnt. I can’t really say I hate it, though. This is infinitely better than waking up to see nothing changed.”

So he mumbled quietly to himself. He hadn’t even given Charlotte a glance yet. Only after satisfactorily taking in the new world, and wandering his eyes over to the catalyst used to summon him, did the Servant take notice to Charlotte.
 “Some changes are somber, though. I didn’t expect Nine Lives to break into pieces like that. A sad sight, isn’t it?”

Even if it was nothing but a small piece, it was a bow he was well, <em>well</em> familiar with. No way he wouldn’t recognize it.

The curious man’s whims finally pushed him towards a long-awaited introduction.

“—Servant, Archer. The name is Philoctetes. You were aiming for Heracles himself, weren’t you? Sorry to disappoint. Being summoned by a Master as cute as you, I’ve clearly gotten the longer end of the stick.”

Pushing his back towards the walls of the alleyway, the pair finally exchanged words.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The archer before her was readable, it was clear to see he was in possession of great strength and yet he lacked the scare factor one might expect from a heroic spirit in relation to Heracles himself.

&quot;Charlotte, Audree, Cadiuex. A pleasure to meet a warrior of your calibre - you may not be the mighty Heracles however one of your stature is surely to be welcomed with open arms by any mage within this ritual&quot; She chose to ignore the flattery the young looking fellow had blurted out at the end of his introduction. She had not found disappointment in his summoning, one linked to such an incredible warrior themselves would be of similar strength no doubt. And to have summoned Philoctetes the student of Heracles well, a great success with such a small fragment of the artefact.

  &quot;It is indeed a great shame that such a fearsome item has been reduced to such a state, would you like the fragment returned to your possession before we begin?&quot; She asked this more out of formality than anything else attempting to establish a clear standing for how their partnership would develop over the course of the war. She was clearly attempting to still convey some sense of an upper class mage to the esteemed warrior before her. She spoke in good English however her thick accent caused her speech to come across slowly as if she were struggling with the language.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085832856191893564 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085832856191893564><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 2:52 AM">2:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her hair had began to flutter somewhat in the wind which had begun to pickup in the area, before he had an opportunity to respond she had stood back up in order to hold her hair in place and she extended her hand out towards Philoctetes as if to shake his.

Acting in good faith, it was clear she was trying to earn the Archer’s trust with a pleasant first impression.

“No, its lamentable that it got shattered, but you can feel free to keep it.”

A careful response that distanced the two of them ever so subtly. Philoctetes was far from disinterest in the artifact, but decided that it was too much of a hassle to acknowledge his Master’s gesture in order to obtain it.

What was far from subtle though was the way he responded to Charlotte’s handshake. Gently pushing away her hand to her left using a single finger seemed like a pretty clear message.

“I want to clarify something— I’ll be referring to you as my Master, but the title only goes as far as a label would. We’re still comrades who are going to be fighting side-by-side in the war, of course, so I’ll make sure to keep you alive and listen to any strategies you have. But don’t mistake that as trust.”

Philoctetes was most famed for his participation and crucial role in the Trojan War. Within that war, he experienced betrayals, starting from the very beginning of the war. Because of being abandoned in Lemnos, he failed to even participate in the war for the longest time.

Charlotte’s demeanor was pleasant, but so was Odysseus’s. That parallel made the jaded warrior want to baffle his Master for a moment. Philoctetes would have been cautious in trusting a Master to begin with, but Charlotte’s efforts to establish trust, due to no fault of her own, had the opposite effect.

After all—

“I’m just fine living on my own.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085889986030739456 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085889986030739456><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 6:39 AM">6:39 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Comrades cooperating at just about arm’s length. Philoctetes was expecting the same dynamic he experienced during the Trojan War out of Charlotte. Trust was unneeded if they shared a common goal.

“… With that out of the way. You have any plans? If you have ideas on how to use me already prepared, I don’t wanna step on your toes.”

When it came to pure combat prowess, Archers were weaker when compared to the other two Knight Classes, but they made up for it with their versatility. High scouting abilities and the ability to attack from a range were invaluable traits.

Without any pause, Philoctetes immediately attempted to ask Charlotte of what her intentions were, given those abilities.

He was more than a little eager to go into battle, it seemed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She believed he would be at least somewhat attached to it or perhaps the memories that he it held for him. She would insist he take it while in this world at least &quot;I must refuse your kindness, such an item holds no place near to me it belongs with you&quot;

She took offence to the snubbing of her handshake, she saw it as a mere formality and although being familiar with the legends surrounding Philoctetes betrayal she didn&#39;t clock onto a link between those events and the refusal to shake hands, however she did appreciate the fact that it was acknowledged rather than completely ignored and he was polite about his refusal as well which did please the young lady.

She listened intently to the young man&#39;s statements, he appeared to be trying to distance himself from her an almost complete u-turn from the cheeky compliment in his introduction, specifically the need for him to clarify their standing as trustless comrades with the same goal seemed a little unnerving for her however she understood a being such as Philoctetes would take a long time to successfully develop good trust with due to a traumatic past of betrayal. She felt as though this wasn&#39;t a topic one should step on too soon.

She paused for a moment before responding to him, she carefully considered the phrasing of what she would say next. &quot;well, I haven&#39;t reallyyyy thought much up, I find developing strategies somewhat boring&quot; by now she had abandoned her formal demeanour and released her inner rockstar upon the poor archer. &quot;I prefer to just wing it bang bang pow epic scenes of fire and music are my favourite, Oh yeah I&#39;m a fire mage and alt rock musican by the way&quot; the way she spoke now made no attempt to be clear in fact some words came out in french, of course this would pose no problem for a servant however any eavesdroppers would certainly be confused by it all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086756667825336430 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086756667825336430><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 4:03 PM">4:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>she was obviously aware of the archer class&#39; weakness in raw strength to the other knight classes and how they were far more versatile when compared to them however she was not overly sure how she wanted to conduct her war and was eager to hear the advice of a seasoned warrior such as Philoctetes. Of course this what would seem as a lack of effort would most likely leave a bad impression for the archer, whom would want to be summoned by a master that seemed more interested in superficial things and appeared to lack any knowledge on how to best utilise their combined strengths.? 

No matter, she was eager and determined and would spend the majority of her war learning from this great warrior she had the privilege in summoning. &quot;To be completely straight forward with you, despite what appears as a lack of care for how i plan to conduct myself during the course of this war, I was hoping I could learn from you and use these experiences to develop myself as a mage&quot; she paused briefly to make sure he was in fact paying attention &quot;So please do step on my toes so to speak id love to hear what your planning would be&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was in spite of the fact that such a rare artifact would have fetched a respectable price if she re-sold it.

Her assessment was correct, too. While Archer tried his best to not show it, it was apparently not a huge challenge to figure out his attachment to the relic. As such, a little bit of insistence was enough to get him to crack.

“… If you’re that adamant, I’ll take it.”

He tried to respond back aloofly, but the moment the artifact hit his palm, it was difficult to miss his eagerly sparkling eyes. At the end of the day, it was a memento of both the great Heracles and his endearing father. It would have been irregular for him to think nothing of it.

Though, it didn’t take long for that rather innocent side of Philoctetes to get suppressed. He disliked showing anything other than a stoic exterior to outward observers, despite how poor he was at the role. Instead, he decided to focus on Charlotte’s offer to ‘step on her toes’.

“I see, so you have nothing planned. You should keep up that outgoing attitude, it suits you more than the corporate talk.”

It wasn’t as though Philoctetes was a particularly delicate individual either. Charlotte’s unrestrained hot-bloodedness was a welcome trait for him.

“In that case, our first course of action should be obvious.”

Obliging Charlotte’s wishes, Philoctetes began to move after that confident declaration.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Although it was Charlotte’s first time visiting Egypt, McDonalds was well-standardized to taste the same everywhere across the globe.

It was an absolute enigma as to why Philoctetes had decided to drag her into the fast-food establishment, though.

“So this is what a ‘restaurant’ looks like! It looks so peculiar,” Philoctetes mumbled as he picked out the nearest seat for two.

“… Why are you looking at me like that? I’m hardly a strategist either. Battle can wait, the first thing to look forward to whenever you land in a foreign place is the food. Its quite convenient that I don’t have to hunt the game myself. Saves me a lot of stress.”

The menu had quite a lot of options as well! The names of the items left much to be desired though. A ‘McDouble’? ‘Big Mac’? Sounded like names a child would come up with. Couldn’t they have picked anything cooler?

At least a ‘Happy Meal’ was a <em>unique</em> name. Stood out from the crowd.

Deciding on his order of a Happy Meal, Philoctetes put down the menu and turned to Charlotte again.

“Coming into a war planless, huh? I don’t hate that at all. Not like I put a lot of thought when jumping into the Trojan War either. If you want to put strategies down the gutter, and just deal with whatever comes up one by one, I’ll oblige you in full.”

What Charlotte thought would be a bad impression was nothing but the contrary. Stuff like that had always been Odysseus’s forte anyways, but whenever Philoctetes would try to jump into battle thoughtlessly, there were a select few Achaean warriors who would stop him. If anything, he was glad Charlotte wasn’t the same type.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086959294475423845 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086959294475423845><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 5:28 AM">5:28 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>That didn’t mean he was devoid of any strategic thoughts, though.

“I can keep an eye on our surroundings. I can see quite far, so if you ever want to go hunting, finding a target shouldn’t be a challenge. It’ll probably be good to direct whoever we chase towards the ocean— they’ll eventually run out of places to run to that way. I’ll target my arrows to bait them to that direction if necessary. Of course, if they decide to do a full-dash towards our location, I have no guarantee that I can stop them, so prepare yourself for that, at least.”

Just that he refused to give it thought past the surface.

Whatever strategies one came up with, they could be easily destroyed by the tide of the battle. Philoctetes trusted more in his prowess than his smarts. As long as him and his Master were on roughly the same page, it should suffice.

“… By the way, you said you’re a musician? I don’t mind having a bard to play up my achievements, but how are you going to do that while in-battle? You can’t manipulate fire while playing… what instrument do you even play?”

Now that he thought about it, he had no idea what music of the modern world sounded like. Or about this world as a whole.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

upon arriving in the well known fast food joint they were welcomed warmly, unusual for a place like this. Charlotte witnessed as Philoctetes expressed an interest in the food of this foreign land, she thought it best she didn&#39;t tell him this good wasn&#39;t from the nation they currently resided in. She found what she believed to be his fascination with the &quot;restaurant&quot; and food names a little peculiar &quot;I&#39;m a tad surprised, you seem as tho you&#39;ve only just learnt of this place upon walking in, aren&#39;t servants given all knowledge of the modern world upon summoning?&quot;

She decided herself to have a 9 chicken nuggets meal and went to order for them. Once returning to their table with their drinks and meals she found herself on the receiving end of planless Philoctetes espousing his support for her lack of organisation.
She understood that although archers were extremely powerful Philoctetes would more than likely be defeated in a straight fight with a saber or lancer so she would have to make effective use of the archers versatility in order to come out on top. This of course implies one would need an extensive strategy.

&quot;Your vision will surely be a great asset however I would prefer to kill only when absolutely necessary, you may call me soft however i don&#39;t wish to take life if there is no need for it to be so&quot; She understood the other mages wouldn&#39;t have the same morals as her and that she would indeed have to kill however she did not want to go out of her way to kill somebody.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088019419336294440 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088019419336294440><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 22, 2023 3:40 AM">3:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A smile crept up on Charlottes face when asked about her career as a musician, &quot;Ah yes!, well I&#39;m an alt rock/rock musician my preferred instrument is a guitar however i can also use a keyboard and i&#39;m saving up some cash to start learning how to drum as well.

She then continued stating, &quot;I do play in battle, I manipulate fire by playing my instrument&quot; She understood this was a very unique approach to fire magecraft however it was what felt most natural to her she had spent a long time refining her style and was proud of her achievements.

/məkˈdɒnldz/ /məkˈdɑːnldz/</code>

<em>noun</em>
      a chain of fast-food restaurants that is known for serving hamburgers, fries, and other simple dishes.


Even setting aside the straightforward dictionary definition, the vague description of the company’s history, its reputation as a beloved but unhealthy establishment, and a variety of other information were made accessible for Philoctetes.

That being said, the taste of the food itself wasn’t exactly something he could get a feel for without trying it out in the flesh. Upon taking a bite of the food, he quickly understood where the ‘unhealthy’ reputation came from. It tasted better than anything he had tried in his lifetime, but the positives were somewhat offset by the very distinct chemical-y aftertaste.

Not to mean he wasn’t enjoying the meal, though.

“… So you don’t want to kill. That’s one hell of a tall order, young lady.”

Swallowing down his food and refreshing his palette with the drink Charlotte happened to pick up for him, Philoctetes continued.

“Take this question how you will, but you’ve never tried to spare someone in battle before, have you?”

An icy glare began to penetrate Charlotte.

“From someone who has— no matter how powerful you are, its <strong>very</strong> hard to win in a fight against someone who intends on killing you, without… well, intending to kill them back. I definitely don’t think killing is for everyone. I get it if you don’t want to. But signing up for a <em>war</em>, and still saying something like that? You’re either a either a fool underestimating the battlefield, or a genius who became too full of yourself.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088384204284379208 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088384204284379208><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 23, 2023 3:50 AM">3:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was a matter that came before morals.

“Developing the intent to kill is the starting line of battle. If you haven’t even gotten there yet, you should take the time to do so now.”

… After letting the silence linger for a while, Philoctetes took another bite out of his burger.

…

…..

He didn’t intend to make the atmosphere so gloomy, even if he thought of it as something that needed to be said. Maybe he should switch the topic.

‘Guitar’. ‘Drum’. All forms of instruments that didn’t exist during his lifetime, but ones he had rudimentary knowledge of. Guitars were heavy string instruments, and drums would produce noise by being smacked.

Their descriptions sounded pretty straightforward, but just the same as the taste of hamburgers— even if he had the knowledge, experiencing the sound firsthand was a whole other beast.

“… Wow, it seems like music’s come a far way since my time as well.”

The process of layering multiple instruments in order to create a melody was a new experience for Philoctetes. Not to mention, the audio was very well-tuned.

Perhaps most importantly though, for any task, the earnestness of the person performing it had a large impact on the final product. Listening to modern music for the first time, he was more than likely to be a <em>little</em> bit biased in his assessment, having no other benchmark to compare Charlotte’s music to.

But it seemed pretty obvious that she was putting her soul into it. There was something about ‘fun’ that was almost infectious.

And if nothing else, whoever was playing the instrument was clearly having a ton of fun.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088384216242339841 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088384216242339841><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 23, 2023 3:50 AM">3:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Using music as a medium to control flames? What a weird practice.”

Most likely, anything related to Magecraft would have gotten the same reaction from Philoctetes. To someone not familiar with the craft, not much about it would come intuitively.

“Doesn’t sound bad at all, though. You should keep at it.”

As awkwardly put as it was, it was Philoctetes’s way of showing his support.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The next passage of speech hit a little close to home. She knew sparing those she would engage in combat with over the next few months would be incredibly difficult however she didn&#39;t expect to find herself being called arrogant - clearly her view on the matter was incorrect, Philoctetes combat experience would definitely provide a strong basis for him to form these statements upon. However she did find the final phrase a tad insulting, almost as if he were implying she was some child that saw the world as rainbows and unicorns still. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right about it being difficult to subdue someone without intending to kill them if they themselves intend to kill you However.&quot; The young French girl raised her voice a little and had burst out in her native tongue in a way that would give off an irritated or perhaps even pissed off vibe. &quot;Just because I wish to spare people where I can does not mean I am incapable of killing and will go into any fight purely wishing to incapacitate my opponent. I am perfectly capable of killing when I need to.&quot; 

She went back to her meal after her outburst realising that she might have caused a scene not a great idea considering there could be other masters nearby and she did not want to draw anymore attention by losing her cool again. Their relationship as master and servant appeared to get off to a rocky start.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089287469729579168 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089287469729579168><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 25, 2023 3:39 PM">3:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Music had indeed come a very very long way since Philoctetes time, Thanks to the technological age music could derive into any number of unique genres and could create all sorts of emotions in different ways, Classical music&#39;s elegance and beauty was well appreciated however younger generations tended to steer more towards the rock&#39;n&#39;roll or pop genres in the modern day. 

She felt as though he were entitled to a taster of anything she had on her, she rummaged about in a bag for cds until finding one of these classical ones, despite the fact that she plays a form of rock music, she enjoyed listening to the delicate classical music her mother brought her up with most likely due to some sentimental attachment to it. Her mother loved Mozart, a very well known musician during the classical period dying in 1791. 

&quot;Here&quot; she stated handing him a disc that simply read &#39;Mum&#39;s stuff&#39; &quot;this ones a little older, they&#39;re very well known pieces and considered classics in the modern era&quot; she was eager to see what he thought of a more traditional music style still considered truly excellent even by modern critiques. Classical music had a very unique way of reaching out and touching your soul when performed so well.

&quot;Yes my decision to manipulate flames with my playing is certainly a strange practice however it has allowed me to more easily improve my magecraft and music simultaneously&quot; She was very proud of her techniques one could say she even looked a little bit smug about how she fought however she certainly knew what she was doing and was no slouch in a fight.

&quot;im grateful for your support in my choice, its how I find magecraft most fun so id keep at it either way however it was a nice touch for you to express that&quot; She was really happy about that and it certainly made up for what she took as insulting earlier however she understood that what he said came from a place of concern rather than taking shots at her - well at least thats what she thought about it all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That’s good. The more fun you can find something… the better you can get at it.”

Philoctetes replied back while fiddling with the disc Charlotte handed over to him. He had technical knowledge over the device, but this was his first time holding it in his hands. Newly coming into the world, there were many things Philoctetes could immerse himself into— and share that sense of enjoyment.

It was a pretty nostalgic feeling. In his life, he felt as though the world turned dull ever since his once-in-a-lifetime opportunity disappeared in the form of the Trojan War. It had been a long while since he found himself so curious.

As a Servant, it was in Philoctetes’s best interest to keep his Master safe. She was his only anchor to the world, after all.

But seeing just how brightly she could smile, in stark contrast to himself, he felt like he should keep it in mind to protect her innocence as well.

… Admittedly,  that was easier said than done. She was the one who signed up for a godforsaken <em>war</em>, after all.

“Just make sure you properly distinguish when you <em>need</em> to kill when the time comes, then.”

Upon finishing his meal, Philoctetes grabbed all the plastic waste on top of the table and headed towards the trash can. In his hurry to clean up after himself in haste, though, he failed to realize the Happy Meal came with a toy, which had neatly nestled itself into the mound of wrappers.

“You done eating yet? Let’s get going. Obviously we need to go looking for other Servants too, but we need to find somewhere to insert bad boy into, right?”

You couldn’t listen to a CD without a player, after all. Philoctetes knew <em>that</em> much. If so, best to get moving quickly.

In a swift and efficient motion, Philoctetes tossed away the trash.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She knew she could determine when she would <em>need</em> to kill an opposing master she wasn&#39;t a child after all she knew what she would be required to do however she apologised for her outburst as a courtesy. 

When he stood up after eating to throw his rubbish away she completely forgot that he had not taken his toy out of the box sadly before she could say anything the rubbish was buried in a nearby bin. It certainly would be a good idea to go find a servant for him to fight, Legends of course determined a servants abilities but it would be good for her to seem him in action at least. 

He disguised this interest by stating that they needed somewhere to put the cd after all, he had clearly forgotten about the portable cd player she had given him earlier though she thought best to not mention it, it was most likely hidden somewhere in his pockets and she didnt want to interfere with his curiosity so they left to look for a shop that would be selling these gadgets.

How would the war develop for this planless duo and who would they encounter on their journeys the war has just begun and Charlotte for one was certain they would be a favourite to win it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
