She was, but Kathleen didn&#39;t want to take any chances if a cop pulled them over. Especially not on the day of her flight to Berenice, where the Holy Grail War was supposed to take place. Ann had burned through almost all her savings to book that flight, after all. It would be a real shame to miss it. Not to mention that according to some scholars at the Clock Tower, the Grail War would soon begin. Ann couldn&#39;t afford to lose a single day, or a single hour, under the circumstances.

...or so Kathleen thought. Ann&#39;s approach, on the other hand, was more casual and measured, which only made her inexperience and unfamiliarity with the Magus world more apparent. She was too easy going, too relaxed, and woefully unprepared. Despite Kathleen&#39;s best attempts to make her work and wake her competitive spirit up, Ann kept brushing off her concerns with a wave of her hand and a nonchalant smile, claiming that everything would work out in the end.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was sitting cross-legged in the smoking area of the airport, a lit cigarette between her lips, glancing at the clock on the flight screens every few minutes or so. When she wasn&#39;t doing so, she was smiling maniacally as she watched a young man in the distance intently.

He was yelling at a woman about his age, his wife or girlfriend Ann supposed, loud enough that other people in the airport were looking at them openly as they argued. The woman was soft-spoken as she talked and walked up to him, but the man slapped her across the face, forcing her to wobble a few steps back from him. Ann shifted her gaze to the woman, who remained silent for a few seconds as her boyfriend continued to shout insults, but eventually she stood up and sucker punched the man, who fell violently to the floor, unresponsive.

Ann struggled to hold back her laughter as the people around them rushed to separate them, the woman now as loud as the man, shouting insults and lashing out at the people trying to restrain her and bring her to her senses. Ann could even see the airport security running over to her from a distance to calm the situation.

Ann found it amusing how quickly a person&#39;s behaviour could change in a matter of a few minutes while she stared at them. From sitting down to fidgeting uncontrollably with shoelaces. From standing idly by to sleeping comfortably on the cold, dirty floor. From joking around to cursing in a foreign language. From hugs and kisses to slaps and punches. In truth, very few people fought like this man and woman under the effect of her Mystic Eyes, but whatever else they did, humans that lost the primal need to conform and practice self-restraint were <em>always</em> entertaining to watch. Not to mention that they made for an exquisite way to pass time as she waited for her flight to Berenice to arrive.

However, every once in a while, <em>someone like this red-haired guy would appear</em>. People whose attitude did not change noticeably, even after looking at them for a long time. Their expressions and body language would barely shift, and the light in their eyes stayed the same throughout. Unwavering. Often they were either people who had a lot of restraint, or almost none at all. Very <em>very</em> formal people, or sociopaths. Ann couldn&#39;t quite figure out which one this guy was, but judging from his clothes, he seemed somewhat well-put. Even a little haughty. The pathetic-looking guy that was with him looked like your typical salary man. Maybe he was a lawyer flying with his assistant or something.

Ann reached into her pocket and retrieved her crumbled ticket, double-checking the information on it for the umpteenth time. Takeoff was scheduled for 5 a.m. and boarding was 45 minutes before takeoff. Glancing at the flight screen again, she figured it was almost time for her to get underway. She took a deep drag on what was left of her cigarette and exhaled the smoke loudly, spitting the butt on the ground before stubbing it out with her heel and leaving with her luggage.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The first thirty minutes of the flight passed quickly as Ann looked out the window, enjoying the sight of the clouds and the pleasant sensation of the plane taking off from the ground. But after that, things slowed down considerably, and the realization of how boring a thirteen-hour flight would be fell hard on Ann&#39;s shoulders. After waiting with nothing to do for nearly four hours back at the airport, she wasn’t ready to do nothing again for more than three times that amount of time. In a cramped space, nonetheless.

Unacceptable. And unlike at the airport, Ann couldn&#39;t just take off her killer glasses and stare at people indiscriminately to pass time. She had to get out, lest she would die of boredom before setting foot in Berenice.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Ann said to a passing flight attendant, removing her glasses to look directly at her with her hazel eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t feel well, I think it&#39;s something with my stomach... could you point me to the bathroom?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ann smiled as she walked calmly down the aisles, her gig bag in hand... however, out of the corner of her eye, she couldn&#39;t help but notice someone familiar inside the plane.

The unaffected red-headed lawyer was there. Was he going to Berenice too? What a funny coincidence. She jokingly prayed he wouldn&#39;t shoot the plane or do some other sociopathic thing as she walked beside him, finally finding the bathroom and closing the door behind her.

She set her gig bag aside and pulled the toilet seat down, sitting on it and stretching her legs as far as she could, enjoying the freedom of movement she was given in this comparatively larger environment than the plane&#39;s seats. She immediately opened her bag and took out a walkman, a pair of headphones and a half-empty pack of cigarettes. She put a cigarette in her mouth and the headphones in her ears, and pressed the &#39;play’ button on her walkman.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086211253837516830 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086211253837516830><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 3:55 AM">3:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI87_X52wmk&amp;list=PLcHXuArdamOxnu8a9DIedumc0ARkaDbpG&amp;index=3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI87_X52wmk&amp;list=PLcHXuArdamOxnu8a9DIedumc0ARkaDbpG&amp;index=3</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUM2MM3fRmZ7kiC8ZK4QuKg><div class=chatlog__embed-author>MrsJimmyFranco87</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI87_X52wmk"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">What&#39;s Yr Take On Cassavetes</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI87_X52wmk width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086211297890279424 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086211297890279424><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 3:55 AM">3:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The music immediately assaulted her ears, the volume having already been raised to 10 during its last use.

Ann couldn&#39;t help but bob her head to the music as she pulled a lighter from her bag and lit her cigarette. Really, it was a wonder to learn she could smoke on long international flights such as this one. There was even an ashtray on the sink to Ann&#39;s right, she noticed. She took a long puff, blessed God for the laxity of the American airline system and savored the music in her ears.

Though, somewhere along the line, the exhaustion from staying up late for her flight, combined with the relaxation and total serenity that the bathroom provided Ann, caught up with her. The punk&#39;s eyes closed on their own, pulling Ann into a deep, unescapable sea of darkness.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was currently laying on the floor of the cramped bathroom, it seemed. She must have fallen asleep without realizing it. Fucking hell. The punk felt like a lethargic turd, her body unresponsive and heavy, like she was wearing some sort of weighted suit over her entire body. She took a deep breath and gathered her strength, pushing her body off the ground with a grunt and some effort, her hand combing over the unruly hair that obscured her face.

She noticed her Walkman on the ground and picked it up, noticing next that the battery was completely dead from the hours of continued use. Dammit. She put it back in her gig bag and washed her face in the bathroom sink. At the same time, Ann wondered why no one had come to get her during the... at least eight hours she&#39;d been sleeping for? Not that she minded, but it was still odd. The stewardess looked pretty annoyed when she went to the bathroom with her carry-on bag, after all. She didn’t expect her little adventure to last more than an hour before someone came to bust her balls.

One look was enough for her to understand the situation.

Dead silence. Everyone on board, even the stewardess and the two captains, was seated with their hands on their heads. The redheaded lawyer she&#39;d spotted earlier was the only one left standing, watching their every move with a fiery gaze, another man she didn&#39;t recognize standing next to him. It wasn&#39;t his pathetic salary-man friend, but a man in a poncho who looked like he came straight out of a western movie, and she swore she saw a huge double-barreled shotgun in his hands too. <strong>A hostage situation</strong>.

From the beginning, she knew there was something fishy about him when he refused to be influenced by her Mystic Eyes. He wasn&#39;t the patient, formal type. This pretty much confirmed he was a sociopath. And it seemed that stripping him of his inhibition pushed him into taking the entire flight hostage, except for her. To think what was supposed to be a small smoke break saved her from this pathetic fate. And they say cigarettes kill.

The man in the poncho that was next to him, she couldn&#39;t get out of her head. How could he have gotten on the plane? She didn&#39;t see anyone like him when they boarded. And how could he have had access to a gun when airport security had checked every one of them? It didn&#39;t make sense. His presence here made no sense. Ann&#39;s heart pounded as she tried to rationalize the situation she was in, to no avail.

A box suddenly came out of her bag and fell down at her feet on the ground. She immediately recognized it. It was one of the most important things Kathleen entrusted to her.

The Servant summoning catalyst.

Ann took the box between her fingers and opened it to reveal a ziplock bag containing white fragments she couldn&#39;t make out. They were soft to the touch, almost silky, and a little ancient-looking. Flower petals, perhaps. These things were supposed to allow her to summon a Servant or something, if she recalled correctly...

Wait, Servants. They’re strong, aren&#39;t they? That&#39;s what Kathleen said back then. Servants are the ultimate tool in the Grail War. Beings of pure, unfettered power that can easily outmatch anything a Magus has to show. And those guys on the other end of the bathroom door only had guns. A Servant wouldn&#39;t have any trouble getting rid of them, would they?

This was as good of a time as any to summon her Servant, then. Ann reached into her bag to retrieve the small notebook Kathleen had left her, the one with the instructions for summoning a Servant. She flipped through the pages so fast she feared she would tear them, and stopped at a page labeled <strong>’WARNING: VERY IMPORTANT, READ THIS BEFORE SUMMONING YOUR SERVANT’</strong>

<strong>But thankfully, Holy Grail Wars are a bit special. Once you get to Berenice, and if you really <em>really</em> want to be a Master, the Holy Grail should recognize you as such and facilitate the summoning process by lending you some of the magical energy it has accumulated. Don’t even try to summon your Servant at the airport, or god forbid, on the plane because you’re bored. It won’t work unless you set foot in Berenice, not to mention-</strong>

&quot;...fuck off!&quot; Ann whisper-screamed, interrupting her reading to flip through more pages, completely dismissing the warnings. Eventually she got to the part detailing the summoning process itself, and began to follow it as best she could, improvising whenever she had to.

First, the summoning circle, two meters in diameter. The bathroom floor was too small. She looked around, searching for a solution, until she found one behind her back: the bathroom wall. The one right behind the sink. It was barely big enough for her to reach out with both arms without touching the door or the other wall. It wasn&#39;t exactly two meters across, but it was close. Ann took her baseball bat and pricked her thumb on the barbed wire around it, drawing blood which she used to haphazardly reproduce the drawing Kathleen had made in the instructions. It was vital to do it with her own blood from the notes, for some reason Ann didn&#39;t care to read.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086211706654568458 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086211706654568458><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 3:57 AM">3:57 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It took her a minute, but once she was done, Ann was impressed with her own artistic skills. The summoning circle was a bit crooked, sure, but pretty similar to the one Kathleen had drawn too. All this with a bloodied thumb in a stressful situation. She could pat herself on the back.

Second, the summoning Catalyst. Normally, this was placed in the center of the summoning circle. For her own version of the invocation, Ann took the ziplock bag and gently balanced it on top of the sink faucet so that it was more or less in the center of the circle she had drawn around the sink.

Then she took a few candles from her bag and placed them on either side of the catalyst on the sink, lighting them with the zippo she had brought to smoke earlier.

Half a dozen steps and a fair amount of improvisation later, Ann&#39;s summoning circle was complete. A square-ish, bloody circle drawn around a sink with a lot of shit on it. Jewels, different-sized candles, salt sprinkles. Honestly, it was quite laughable how horrible it all looked meshed up together. Even Ann, who was not known for her meticulousness and attention to detail, was quite frankly horrified by the result.

&quot;...whatever!&quot; Ann looked back at the mirror, plucking up the courage to read the frankly absurd and borderline embarrassing magic incantation Kathleen had written. She took a deep breath, straining to believe in herself as she read the paper in her hands.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086211756302549024 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086211756302549024><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 3:57 AM">3:57 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Silver and iron to the origin...” She started, her voice shaky and unconvinced. “Gem and the archduke… of contracts to the cornerstone.

Kathleen said in her instructions that even a commoner Ann should have felt the atmospheric change in Mana density once the ritual started, but alas, nothing seemed to change when she said the incantation. Only the slight shaking of the plane and the random flickering of the candle flames gave Ann hope that the incantation was working.

“The alighted wind becomes a… wall. The gates in the four directions close, coming from the crown, the… the three-forked road that leads to the kingdom circulates.”

The next few words she didn&#39;t need the paper to recite. Ann simply looked ahead in the mirror, making eye contact with herself, her eyebrows furrowing as she said the word with more intent.

“Repeat every five times. Simply, shatter once filled. I announce… your self is under me, my fate(doom) is in your sword…”

Ann felt more and more stupid as she continued. Incredibly stupid. And this incantation was so stupidly complicated. The gates in the four directions? What the hell did that mean? Was this an elaborate prank by Kathleen so she wouldn&#39;t participate as Master, or had not setting foot in Berenice set her back too much?

Ann tossed the incantation aside and looked at herself in the mirror. Her posture changed as she felt her limiters break due to her Mystic Eyes. The freedom in her heart expanded, and her attention to details was dragged even further through the mud. To the point where she argued within herself that the incantation wasn’t necessary. After all, Kathleen said the point of the incantation was to <em>convince herself</em> that what she was doing worked, right?

She looked at herself in the mirror for long, long seconds. Her carefree expression hardened as she thought back to her goal. To her younger years. To the pain and suffering she had endured that had been so easily swept away by a simple film. She thought about it again and again as she entered a stare-off with herself, reminding her punk brain of the reason why she had gone on a thirteen-hour flight, and why she was risking her life to go to the other side of the world… 

And finally, she was ready.

“Come out.”

She felt a burning sensation slowly rise in her chest. A switch turned on in her head.

“Come on, stop fucking with me.”

The flames of the candles flickered strongly. Ann grabbed the sink with both hands and leaned forward, her inhibition all but disappearing inside her own eyes.

“I want to win the Holy Grail, but I can’t do it in my current state. I’m not even at square one. I need <em>you</em> to be a Master, buddy.”

The air around her turned into opaque molasses. Her breathing quickened until it became ragged, as if she were running a marathon.

“ I need a Servant. I <em>want</em> a Servant!”

“Come on…. come on…. <strong>COME ON!!!</strong>”

Her chest was threatening to come apart as the burning pain intensified. The punk was practically screaming as her desire reached its most extreme limits, the atmospheric Mana rapidly increasing as a result...

“<strong>GET YOUR ASS IN HERE AND ANSWER MY SUMMON, SERVANT!!!</strong>”

So suddenly did it erupt, and with so much force, that the rattling gaps of the bathroom door were unable to contain it, causing it to bleed into the outside aisle in an explosive torrent of magical energy which was impossible to conceal.
Ann had played her card. It was impossible to return it to her hand.
The question that remained was simple: what form did this card of hers take?

Judging from the shattering impact of her violent invocation in the bathroom, it was clear that her summoning had functioned as intended, and yet there was no entity in eye-shot for Ann to see. No proof of her success. No one to deliver her from the dangerous predicament she had found herself in.

Yet nervous whispers could be heard outside.
A deafening tension as the cowering hostages were granted a brief reprieve from their tormentor by the arrival of something even more absurd. Inexplicable.
The bathroom lacked the space to accommodate the familiar about to manifest, and so it had instead begun to take shape in the room adjacent to the wall onto which Ann had painted the summoning circle with her own blood. As for what it was…

A flower?

Its form was yet unstable, the vessel struggling to secure its tangible form due to the sparse amount of energy it was provided with. So high in the heavens were they that the leylines of the land had difficulty to reach out and alleviate the cost of the ritual, though what had now been set in motion could no longer be stopped.

The petals shifted.

Its texture was spotless and smooth, swaying in an unnerving rhythm that almost made it seem like it was breathing. As if it was alive. Or harboring something that was.

The floor began to creak. Windows fractured and the roof gave way as the petals continued to grow in size and found themselves restricted by the narrow confines of the aircraft’s walls. At once the passive onlookers were ripped from the stupor and began to panic, the scream of children drowned out by the shrill screech of torn metal, glass shattering and flooding the cabin with torrential winds. This amount of damage was unrecoverable. They were all going to die. Chaos erupted as the passengers became aware of the inevitable fate that now awaited them, only to be once more humbled by the cause of their demise.

The rose had begun to twist and contort, to slither. Its petals had unfurled and revealed themselves to be draconic wings, the texture of their skin reptilian and grotesque. A monster. A creature that should have only existed in myth and fairytale had been visited upon them like some manner of cruel joke. From within its now uncurled mass it reared its pointed head, eyes fixed on the meal that had welcomed its arrival, a veritable feast fit for a prince. The beast took a single step forward towards the horrified wailing, its maw parting as if it meant to speak.

The aircraft buckled under the stress this creature placed on it, its weight and size crushing it from the inside out and causing it to tear itself apart mid-flight.
An explosion.
Shrapnel had found its way into the engines, propelled to such high speeds that it punctured its vulnerable components and ignited the volatile fuel with the resulting friction, bathing the sky in amber glow that served as a backdrop to the many lives now tumbling to their deaths, drowning in the cloudless expanse as their bodies were pulled ever closer to the land below.
Already the nile had come into view, far away as it was. Growing larger. Ever closer.

The boredom Ann experienced previously must have now seemed like a distant memory.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her heart was beating fast and hard in her chest. The smell of ozone invaded her nose. This sensation was unlike anything she had ever felt in her life. Her body was alert, nervous, her shoulders rising and falling rapidly as she struggled to calm her breathing.

“M-Magic!!” Her voice, shaky from exertion and excitement, whispered. “That was magic!! I just did magic… with a freaking circle and some candles!!”

The realisation hit her like a truck, her arms lowering excitedly so she could take a look at... the empty bathroom stall? She looked left, right, at what was left of the mirror in front of her, but there was nothing. Her excited smile immediately disappeared from her face. I did the thing, so where the hell is my Servant? She asked herself.

And, as if to answer her, the ground beneath her feet shook violently. The cracking and tearing of metal, the sharp whistle of the wind violently entering the plane, the collective screams of terror from the passengers... it all bombarded her ears, so loudly that she couldn&#39;t even hear herself think.

Kathleen was right, summoning a Servant on the plane <em>was</em> a bad idea. But what&#39;s done is done, and Ann had to be quick on her feet. There was no time for doubts or second-guessing, and besides, that&#39;s how she operated. Act first, think later, and she was still in the act stage.

She quickly grabbed her gig bag and slung it over her shoulders, kicking the door on her way out of the bathroom.

The scene gave her pause, the woman jumping with shock, eyes wide. She was greeted by the back of some sort of huge dinosaur-esque creature, with scales of a purer pristine white than anything she had seen before. A barbed, segmented tail that unfurled and slithered about. Wings that spread gracefully behind its enormous body.

There was her Servant. What she summoned was <strong>a motherfucking dragon.</strong>

Ann&#39;s hair and clothes fluttered violently in the wind, but the rest of her body was completely still. Her jumpy, excited body and uninhibited mind processed this vision and realisation in two contradictory ways, oscillating between absolute horror and excitement endlessly. The ground shook violently under her feet, nearly knocking her on her butt, forcing her mind to make the choice.

Her motionless body ran and lunged at the beast, her leg rising as she jumped and planted her foot firmly on the beast&#39;s back, using it as an anchor to jump a second time high into the air. Her body collided with the back of the beast&#39;s neck, her arms and legs holding on tightly, riding the thing without regard for her own safety. She took a deep breath.

“<strong>MY SERVANT IS A FUCKING DRAGON, HAHAHAHA!!</strong>” Ann maniacally screamed at the top of her lungs, her hands tightly gripping the Servant’s scales. “YOU SHOULD’VE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE TAKING <strong>MY</strong> PLANE HOSTAGE, RED-HAIRED FUCKER!!!”

The raging winds entering the ravaged plane almost completely drowned out her shooting, but she didn&#39;t care. The excitement already went to her head. The adrenaline completely drowned out her fears. She was seeing red. Right now, she was in her <em>zone</em>, in her element. She felt invincible after summoning such a beast. No one else could take her out of this moment. No one.

&quot;Come on, dragon!&quot; She ordered, raising her hands as if to direct the dragon&#39;s gaze upwards, out of the falling aircraft. &quot;Get us out of this lame fucking plane!!!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What greeted them was the unobstructed view of the distant horizon, the world’s edge, the two now entering the domain of the sky that was theirs for the taking. What was there to fear when one commanded a creature of myth, a dragon, their service and loyalty assured by to the bond that existed between them as Master and Servant… or was it?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“...?”</code>

The beast’s head twitched, its eyes flicking behind itself as it snapped out of the odd subconscious instinct that compelled it to follow the sudden command issued to them, now becoming aware of the weight clinging to the base of its neck. An unfamiliar presence. An intruder.

It’s head rearing and curling as it attempted to snap at its unwelcome passenger with its razor-sharp teeth. All the while they had begun to whirl out of control, their figure starting to resemble a spinning-top eternally on the verge of near-collapse, their long tail cutting apart the space around them as the force of its chaotic movements caused it to crack like a whip that indiscriminately lashed out at the debris around them. More than once it seemed to even strike at an unlucky survivor that had just happened to fall close to their vicinity, only for their body to be obliterated into a pink mist of misshapen chunks of flesh and bone due to the sheer force of the beast’s monstrous strength.

Had Ann not gripped so tightly to its scales, it would have been all but impossible to remain perched atop of her Servant like a mount, but it would have been this very resilience that bought her the time required for the Lindwyrm to snap out of its arbitrary outburst.

All it took was for it to lay its eyes on her.
She. A woman. Though her short hair and neglectful appearance did not resemble the princesses of eld in the slightest, nor even the common-folk and peasantry, it was impossible to mistake her for a man. Thus for her to have reached out to the beast, with not a shred of hesitation nor fear to bar her judgment… as if she sought something in it, just as it sought something from her.

Despite this, her smile widened along with her elation, so much so that she couldn&#39;t help but giggle as they finally left the burning carcass of the plane they were on. She didn&#39;t even think about the hundred or so passengers she had probably killed through her carelessness. All she could think about was the warmth of the last rays of the setting sun on her face, the sound of the wind blowing in her ears and the beauty of the curvature of the earth as seen from above the clouds.

Her gaze returned to the back of the scaly thing and the first thought that came to her mind was, god, that image of me riding a dragon would make a killer album cover. An excited chuckle came out of her mouth again. It was so fucking cool. It felt so fucking good to get out of this hopeless situation on the plane on her own. With her own power as a Master. She felt so liberated atop this dragon. Like she could go anywhere, do anything. Absolute freedom, so high up in the clouds.

But Ann&#39;s excitement was interrupted when the dragon jerked violently in the air, their majestic ascent turning into a chaotic fall when her Servant forcefully tried to get her off its back.

She quickly clutched the beast&#39;s neck with her arms and legs in a bear hug, her hands gripping tightly to its scales for a better grip, her knuckles turning white as the blood stopped pumping through her forearms with the effort. Ann held on for dear life as she was made to do the most violent rodeo in human history, no less than ten thousands metres above the ground, her fingers and palms bloodying as the creature&#39;s sharp scales sank into her skin and flesh. So focused on her grip, she barely noticed the few passengers who were unfortunate enough to approach the dragon and were turned into mincemeat by a strike from its gigantic lizard tail.
 
But finally, as the dragon calmed down and pulled back its head to look at its passenger, Ann was finally able to loosen her grip and calm her ragged breathing and racing heart. The dragon&#39;s gaze was unsettling. Its eyes radiated purity and elegance in the form of hues and patterns, but its eyelids slid maniacally, evidence of its madness and short temper. Ann didn&#39;t know what to make of it, nor of the fact that it was <em>talking</em>. But in this situation, what little common sense she usually had was shattered by the effects of his Mystic Eyes and the adrenaline coursing through her veins. Her mouth opened without her consent, blurting out the first thing that came to her mind upon hearing the dragon&#39;s inappropriate question.

Make up your damn mind!!”

Unhinged. Confronted by an ancient mystical creature, the red-haired girl had somehow found enough sass and courage, or perhaps foolishness, to fault the scaly menace for its unconventional courtship tactics, not even thinking of the repercussions such words could have on the creature’s mood…

Her mood shifted from one extreme to the other as she contemplated the thing’s outrageous question, as blood, grim and ashes fell around them, an unexpected moment of consideration that was only possible through the effects of her Mystic Eyes.

“...you know what?” 

She climbed a little higher on the creature’s neck, their foreheads rubbing, all distance between them closing physically and metaphorically in an unexpected moment of intimacy.

“If you help me win the war, then…”

And, planting a featherly kiss on the dragon’s scaly snout, Ann eyes crinkled at the edges and the corners of her lips turned upwards in a deranged smile.

“Sure!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In its time, it would have been considered uncouth for a couple to engage in such physical contact before they were officially wed, let alone in such a spontaneous manner, though considering the sheer absurdity of the current situation, a mere harmless kiss to its snout was not exactly worthy of mention when the wreckage of flame and steel rained down like fireworks to celebrate their union.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“You would give yourself so willingly?”</code> the wyrm reeled in astonishment to Ann’s unexpected consent, though it made no attempt to pull back from her touch, made thrall to her unhinged grin already, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“And ask of me only to rid this world of the pests intent on causing you harm?”</code>

It wasn’t unsurprising for the beast to be taken aback by her lack of resistance. In life, its human parents had to resort to trickery and deception to convince princesses of the surrounding kingdoms to agree to present themselves before it. Yet here it was called forth by someone who would fulfill its dearest wish. Just like that. Without resistance.

Lindwyrm’s body shivered in delight, its clawed limbs stretching as it unleashed a bellowing roar to issue a warning to all that would deign to listen. As there were no church bells present, it simply would have to spread the news itself. A Monster had found its Mate. A Master its Servant.
This piercing cry was its vow, its affirmation to Ann’s demands, a promise given voice by monstrous squall.

You yet lack a great many things, but not for much longer!”</code>

Reluctantly parting with Ann’s close touch, the beast focused its mind on the many tasks left undone to properly receive its bride-to-be, a strange vigor sparking to life within its chest akin to an innate desire bending and stretching against one’s flesh and seeking to burst free. It had yet to grow hungry, freshly summoned as it was, and yet it was surrounded by delectable fruit only waiting to be plucked from the sky. They would be a poor replacement for a proper feast, one fit for a wedding worthy of its bride, but they would suffice to sate the odd feeding impulse that gripped its heart. Was this not a joyous occasion after all? It would only do to celebrate it in kind.

Spotting a cluster of debris to its left, a variety of scrap consisting of the aircraft’s former tail-fin and several support beams used to reinforce the interior walls, Lindwyrm suddenly lunged forward after a single powerful stroke of its wings, the force of the rapid acceleration allowing the beast to instantly close the gap. Rearing its head, it opened its jaws and unleashed the cruel howl of an unforgiving blizzard, seemingly breathing the essence of winter itself and instantly encasing the entire cluster in thick and beautifully glittering ice.

A child perhaps? Several of them?

It would appear panic had taken hold of a group of survivors, huddled together in desperation and seeking to comfort themselves in the last few minutes remaining to them, though it would appear that their screaming had only attracted the attention of the perpetrator to their demise. If they were a family, at least they could find solace in meeting their end together.

Its body weaving and slithering across the air like the ivory serpent it was, Lindwyrm had made it to its quarry, and now opened its fanged maw for a new purpose.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 3:01 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she thought her metaphorical high could not climb any higher, she was proven wrong as the dragon flexed, slithered, and dared anyone to step forward and break him off from his new bride with its shout. If she felt invincible on the beast&#39;s back just moments ago, then this feeling went beyond even invincibility. Such a powerful roar, such fluid yet deadly movements. While riding this creature, she felt like a <em>god</em> whose powers could not be matched or challenged. Absolute dominance in the skies.

&quot;Fuck yeaaaaah!!!&quot; Ann screamed with glee in response to it, her grip on the creature&#39;s back diminishing as she let herself go in her delirium, all sense of self-preservation and panic leaving her body in favour of elation.“I lack so many things! I have a serious, <em>serious</em> lack of Ferris and Cameron in my life that only you can satisfy, dragon!!!”

Ann&#39;s mad giggling was lost in the screams and shrieks of the dragon and the few passengers who had not yet died, her back straightening as excited tingles ran from her chest to the ends of her limbs. Blood dripped from her hands where she clutched at the creature&#39;s scales, and her torn jeans were further marred by the sharp edges and spikes of the creature&#39;s neck. But none of that mattered at the moment. All that mattered was the strength and obedience of this Servant she rode, and how close her dream seemed at that moment. Not even the screams of the children or the sound of tearing metal could keep him away from those two things...

In their place, she wouldn&#39;t have hesitated one second to defuse the situation or die trying, they only had themselves to blame for how this situation turned out!

Ann&#39;s body lurched forward as the dragon flapped its wings and landed heavily on the broken half of the airplane&#39;s tail end, slamming her face right into its bulging neck. Blood dripped from one of her nostrils, but her bewildered smile didn&#39;t change... no, it curled up even more as the dragon spat its icy breath onto the plane carcass, her body shivering from both the excitement and the sudden drop in temperature. She hadn&#39;t summoned and ridden just any old-fashioned dragon. She had summoned an <em>ice dragon</em>!

Ancient legends described these mystical creatures as satirical and man-eating, and it seemed that the Servant she had summoned was true to those descriptions.

Ann glanced briefly at the terrified passengers, noticing the terror and helplessness on their faces. She didn&#39;t usually feel much empathy for the masses, but that trait was even more pronounced in this adrenaline-filled situation. The only thing she could think of as she watched them cower in fear was, hey, no hard feelings, it was either that or getting shot.

“Go on, dragon!” She commanded, bringing some of her own affirmation as a Master to the dragon’s otherwise inhuman act. “You’ve earned yourself a few snacks after getting us out of this situation, <strong>eat to your heart’s content!!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were still more survivors present around them however, and wasting no time, Lindwyrm continued its feast, the gruesome slaughter encouraged by its very own Master.

And it was good that she did.

As someone who lacked proper training as a mage, not to mention one whose Magic Circuits were of abysmal quality, it was impossible for her to provide her Servant with any worthwhile magical energy. Though the magical bond that linked them together was strong, the river that was to act as her Servant’s supply ran dry. Lindwyrm itself was unaware of this of course, instead spurred on by an instinctual hunger that it sought to quench with the lifeblood of those unfortunate enough to cross its path, utterly oblivious that it was the lacking quality of its own Master which compelled it to give itself over to its bestial urges, even more so than it had in life.
She was no mage. She lacked a special lineage. She was a commoner. She was-

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“...no princess. Those bred from noble lineage would be appalled by mine appetite. Instead you relish it. Celebrate it.”</code>

The beast snarled as its tongue licked its blood-stained maw clean, restoring it to its brilliant white hue. Was it perhaps… laughing?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Born from the earth am I. Of common birth are you. Yes. A delicate and painted doll would suit neither of us. No. Thine hands are not meant for the gilded comforts of court; let them be spared the tedium of needlework and gossip. If so, what will they hold instead? Should I return from warring and hunting, should I find thee awaiting my homecoming at our doorstep, or riding at my side, the grime and weariness of the road shared between us, bride of mine?”</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Most of the macabre scene was blocked by the creature&#39;s neck, but what little blood and guts Ann could see was more than enough to paint the scene. Movie props have nothing on real gore, Ann couldn&#39;t help but wonder as she heard bones breaking and flesh tearing inside the dragon&#39;s mouth. Fucking brutal.

Ann&#39;s body shook and slid down the neck of the dragon as it finished its meal, gave its speech, and laughed appallingly. She took a half step and repositioned herself on its neck before speaking.

“So basically… you’re asking me if I’d fight by your side?” Ann simplified the beast’s old-fashioned jargon with her own words. She thought about it for a few seconds… and finally chuckled in response, slapping the back of the creature&#39;s neck loudly with her palm. “Ha, ‘bride of mine’! Man, it’s gonna need some getting used to. So weird!”

Not just because of her troublesome Mystic Eyes or because of her trust issues with people… but rather because being tied down to someone was a fate that a free electron like her dreaded. She&#39;d had her share of boyfriends, sure, but she&#39;d never allowed those relationships to go from ‘I like you’ to ‘I love you’. To think she’d say yes to a <em>dragon</em> of all things. The incongruity.

“I’m not very good with needles and gossip, so riding out into battle with you sure sounds like more of my thing.” She finally replied with a shrug. “Not very noble or princessy, like you said, but that’s how I roll. I would definitely leave you if you kept me locked up in a Castle somewhere like some common house wife.”

Ann leaned over the dragon&#39;s neck until her upper body and the side of her face pressed against its scales in an embrace, the rough texture of the creature&#39;s hide brushing uncomfortably against her skin. She could still hear the gurgling and sliding of blood and body parts from its previous meal down its long throat, but surprisingly, it didn&#39;t repulse her. On the contrary, it was strangely endearing to see how wild and savage the creature was with those passengers, and how well-spoken and noble it was with her.

She raised her head and looked at the dragon&#39;s lizardy face. Her red bangs hid part of her eyes and face, but the lines that ran from her nose to the corner of her mouth betrayed her playful smile.

“-do you have what it takes to keep me from dying in this Holy Grail War? I heard from a good friend that the Masters are pretty crafty, not to mention they’ve got Servants who could be just as strong as you. What makes you different from them, dragon?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn’t unusual for princes and kings to leave their wives behind as they themselves left on lengthy excursions, the love and passion sung about in songs and fairy tales a rarity often drowned out by the bartering of alliances paid for with princesses. They’re only use was symbolic, to tie one Kingdom to the other, and to eventually produce an heir that would inherit these threads.
But Lindwyrm was a creature driven by instinct, not reason, and in its desire to seek a companion, it was only natural for it to want them to be close at hand. In fact, Ann’s common birth was much more in line with Lindwyrm’s own preferences to begin with.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“As you have agreed to be mine bride, it falls to me to assure thine content and well-being. For the gift you have granted me, I shall repay in kind. You speak of opposition, threats that mean to steal you away from me. They shall find their way barred by fang and claw. I shall not suffer our ceremony to be interrupted by those that would deny me mine firstborn right.”</code>

It all led back to this: The beast’s compulsion to be wed, its obsession with a female mate.
What was it that fueled their manic quest to see their wish fulfilled? What void did it seek to fill? Throughout western myth, dragons had always been shown to covet wealth and riches, their notable greed a common attribute, so what was it that Lindwyrm sought to gain from Ann?
That being said, even if posed the question directly, Lindwyrm was unlikely to possess the answer to the mystery itself, unaware of the deficiency it was compelled to remedy, instead interpreting its instinct in the most natural way.

There was no dishonesty in its passion, its desire to take Ann as its bride.
For that it would kill, and if necessary, die.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Without a doubt, this dragon had a lot of pride and confidence in its strength, and Ann liked that. She hated wimps with all her heart, and could only follow and respect the strong that recognized themselves as such. Not to mention that it had some sense of reciprocity, wanting to do her justice as much as she did it by accepting its earlier proposal. However, its last words left Ann confused.

&quot;Firstborn rights?&quot; She repeated, intrigued. Did dragon families have such a thing as firstborn rights? It seemed rather medieval, alright. But even by medieval standards, the amount of objectification Ann was subjected to was a little too much for her to feel comfortable with. Bride this, bride that. Why was this dragon so obsessed with getting laid? Kathleen had warned her that when they were summoned, most Servants began by sizing up their Master to see if they were worthy of such a title. Questions like ‘Are you my Master?’ and the like were common first words spoken by Servants… but not by this dragon. The first thing it sought after the summoning was whether Ann would offer herself to him as a wife. Truth be told, she was just as unhinged as it was in accepting on the spot, but still. There was a lot of talking and figuring out to be done with…

So far they had experienced a tumultuous summoning, tore a plane to shreds, and were nose-diving straight towards the waters of the Nile, but they had yet to learn each other&#39;s names. Even though this was not the most sensible time to do so, Ann still wanted them to exchange names. They were such important parts of one’s identity, after all. And besides, it was getting tiring to call it ‘dragon’ all the time.

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cute, if not a little weird,&quot; She began, steadying herself on the dragon&#39;s back. &quot;But being called &#39;bride of mine&#39; all the time is going to get boring real fast. Call me Ann instead, I say we’re way past first-name basis. And I’ll c-&quot;

The frozen carcass of the plane they were on rocked violently under their feet, cutting Ann off in his speech, turning slightly to the side as it struggled to hold the dragon&#39;s weight and stay parallel to the ground. The dragon&#39;s sharp claws were digging into the metal and kept them from falling too fast and losing their balance, but obviously the plane&#39;s metal body was not designed to support ice dragons on its ground. Ann leaned forward and hugged the dragon&#39;s body tightly, finishing her thought harder as the violent gusts of wind blew in her ears and paralyzed her hearing.

“<em>And I’ll call you what…?!!</em>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A name. Simple and elegant. Synonymous to one’s very own existence, so much so that it has even found mystical value in myth and magecraft. To lack one is to lack one’s own identity, fated to fade and fray, the boundaries of one’s individuality lost in time and remembered as a mere thing. An idea. A story.

Lindwyrm’s pure-white scales bristled as Ann shared with it her name, asking for its own in return. To her inquiry, it lacked a response.

They had fallen for quite some time at this point, and as a result had veered off-course and distanced themselves from the main wreck which still continued to plummet mercilessly towards the outskirts of Aswan below them. The beast remained silent, though it was unclear whether it was due to confusion or a deliberate disregard of Ann’s efforts to form a more personal connection, though this afforded it the opportunity to let its gaze wander across the horizon. Rays of somber red washed over the clouds, the heaven’s crystal blue gradually eroded by the setting sun as it kissed the distant mountains, heralding the coming of dusk.
Not much longer until it was time for them to consummate their marriage.

The powerful musculature under Lindwyrm’s hide tensed beneath Ann’s legs as the beast readied itself to leap off its crumbling perch, its eyes now set on a sizable building structure below them. A busy department store by the looks of it. Big enough to serve as a castle, and populated enough to provide a feast for kings.

No son was I, no prince. A Lindwyrm was born. A mother I had no longer.”</code>

Lindwyrm leapt off in one smooth motion, its long and elegant tail swaying mesmerizingly in the biting gale as it barrelled headfirst towards the earth, its entire body pointed and sharp, a silver streak descending from the heavens like a silent bolt of lightning.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“A beast is a beast. A bride is a bride. What need is there for more?”</code>

An unsettling confession. Though Lindwyrm’s devotion to its bride was genuine, it also appeared as if this desire was not to a person, but to a label, one currently worn by Ann, but one which stripped her of her own individuality. Was it that Lindwyrm’s values as a monster were simply incompatible with that of human’s, or was it that it actively refused to see Ann as anything other than its bride, trimming her of anything it deemed unnecessary in the process?

Denying her a chance to retort, Lindwyrm folded its wings backwards around itself to encase Ann in a protective shell made of their own hide and flesh, bracing itself for impact as it was only seconds away from reaching the structure it had spotted earlier. No warning was given to the civilians present within it. The resulting blast created an ear-splitting explosion that carried far and wide, the roof offering no resistance as Lindwyrm punctured it with ease and tore open a huge crater into the ground that served as its cushion. The nearby load-bearing pillars cracked and crumbled from the rumbling eruption, threatening to bring the entire building down on itself and bury the beast along with it. But it intervened.

Like the broken dam of a massive river crushing one in its violent torrent, Lindwyrm showed no restraint as it tore open its jaw as wide as it could to exhale its most powerful roar, a Draconic Breath imbued with the essence of arctic frost which indiscriminately encased everything around it in layers upon layers of ice and snow, a rite by which it claimed the territory as its own. This is where it would hold its banquet, where its precious marriage ceremony would be held.

Even if there had been whimpering screams of any <s>un</s>lucky survivors previously, they had now been forever silenced as they were frozen in time, bodies suspended in the air mid-fall, pieces of concrete and furniture mended together to form unconventional pathways and spires, a malformed and broken fortress made to stand tall by the ice which held it together.

The stage now set, Lindwyrm unfurled its wings to release the bride it had preserved, kept safe and free from harm, the only living human in a building once bustling with laughter and life.

It was not the name of an individual, but that of a monster. A monster among many others who was denied its individuality at birth, and who ended up wearing the label that people have stuck to it for lack of a better alternative. And just as they did to it, it stuck Ann with the label of bride without caring about <em>her</em>. Ann was a bride, but the bride was not Ann. She was a role, but the role was not hers.

And, to put it bluntly, it was completely unacceptable to her. But as she was denied her individuality, she was then denied the right to fight back as the dragon leapt from the frozen remains of an airplane and soared through the air at great speed. Ann&#39;s grip on its back weakened from the violent air blowing, the woman threatening to let go at any moment, but the Lindwyrm wisely spread its wings behind it to protect its rider from imminent death, crashing into the building it had spotted in a move that sent Ann&#39;s body violently toppling and her face slamming into the dragon&#39;s back for the second time since it was summoned.

The sound of the explosion left her in shock for a bit, her ears ringing loudly and struggling to pick up the sounds of fright and the screams of customers disturbed by Lindwyrm&#39;s landing. The violent shock and bombastic crash left Ann in a state of confusion and stupor, and the dragon&#39;s closed wings prevented her from looking at what was happening around them. The only thing she could do as the dragon released its colossal icy breath was to calm her pounding heart and regain the hearing she had temporarily lost from the landing.

But eventually the beast spread its wings open, and Ann was assaulted from all sides. Her jerky and ragged breathing turned to condensations of white fog, her skin burned from the sudden cold, and her eyes were blinded by the pristine white that covered everything around them.

She endured the pain and opened her eyes slowly, trying to get a good look at where Lindwyrm had landed. The frozen elevator in the distance and the huge crater that stretched around them told her all she needed to know. It had landed in some kind of shopping centre, then iced the place with the same breath it had used on the airplane.

&quot;It&#39;s freezing... are you sure this is my court? &quot; She huffed, each of her words causing a storm of white fog to roll in front of her face, the redhead furiously rubbing her forearms in search of warmth. &quot;Because it doesn&#39;t look very wedding-like nor king-like, Lindwyrm.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However her words caused its movements to cease completely as it regarded Ann blankly.
It seemed that it had not accounted for her disapproval of their lair.

Her nose and cheeks had already begun to redden from the cold, and the woman sniffled loudly before continuing. &quot;There&#39;s too much snow, too much frost, too many icicles on the ceiling... I feel like I&#39;m going to die of hypothermia here, Lindy!&quot;

Ignoring as best she could the icy human that the dragon was gnawing on like a popsicle, the woman turned away and took a few steps forward, crunching more snow under her feet as she admired her pristine white surroundings. What an absurd sight. To think that this was really happening. That a dragon was eating a guy behind her, and that it froze an entire shopping centre with its breath. Crazy.

&quot;Oh, and I already told you to call me Ann.&quot; She abruptly turned back to him, sighing loudly, the resulting white haze almost completely obscuring her face for a split second. &quot;I bet that would make the wedding ceremony better, too. To call me by my name and not some heartless label.”

She sighed again, kicking the snow at her feet until the ground appeared underneath, which she then sat on before pulling from inside her jacket her cigarette pack and zippo.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want me to call you &#39;dragon&#39; or &#39;beast&#39; all the time, would you?&quot; She took out a cigarette from the pack and placed it between her lips. &quot;You need to be more sensitive with women, Lindy.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“No hearth to warm you. No bedding to receive you. I see. As a human your needs and comforts are unlike mine own, your flesh more fragile and delicate. More tender.”</code>

Yet Lindwyrm lacked the means to provide for Ann. Despite the fact that they were surrounded on all sides by shops selling all manner of apparel, not to mention furniture and electrical equipment that could easily provide formidable protection against the chill, understanding of modern appliances eluded the beast, and thus it simply remained seated as it was, its serpent-like eyes following the movement of Ann’s fingers with primitive curiosity. The small stick-like object which she fished from her jacket and placed in her mouth was unknown to Lindwyrm after all.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“But are you not to be mine bride, and I thine groom?”</code>

Was it stubbornness which caused it to reject Ann’s name, or was it simply its nature as a beast? Perhaps it simply lacked the emotional literacy to understand. Perhaps it did not care enough to try.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Who or what you are is of no consequence to me.

And even worse…

&quot;You don’t care who I am as long as I agree to be your bride?!” She screamed silently, her head snapping back up to face Lindwyrm.

Its true intentions were laid bare. Lindwyrm didn&#39;t care about a good Master, or a good wife, or any individual for that matter. All it cared about was a woman offering herself to it, which Ann did without thinking, but once that was done, the beast was satiated. It wasn&#39;t looking for a suitable individual to bond with, but for a <em>hole</em> to be filled. A bride-shaped, uncharacteristic, incredibly boring hole that any human female could fit into effortlessly regardless of alchemy or suitability.

Ann gritted her teeth in anger and betrayal, bending the orange filter of the cigarette in her mouth until the cigarette stood up against her face. She took a long breath and calmed herself, relaxing her jaw until her cigarette returned to its original shape, dangling freely from her cracked and cold lips.

She lit the end of her cigarette and took a long drag, holding her breath as she rose from the ground and approached Lindwyrm&#39;s face. She put both feet on the ground and leaned forward until her back was parallel to the ground and her face was level with Lindwyrm&#39;s, like a parent looking down and scolding her child.

She straightened up and took another puff of her cigarette, looking at the huge hole Lindwyrm had created in the ceiling before exhaling the smoke, her eyes absentmindedly watching the orange sky above through the ceiling. The rush of nicotine helped calm her mind, but the taut veins on her neck remained as a sign of her anger. She was definitely pissed at the Servant, big time.

&quot;...you know, my Magus friend told me that the relationship between Master and Servant is built on mutual respect, so let&#39;s try to respect each other. I’ll put up with the cold, but in exchange, I don&#39;t want to hear the word &#39;bride&#39; or any other synonym coming out of your mouth.

And yet its gaze was unbroken, its slitted pupils never breaking contact with Ann’s own. Such was her command, a throw-away statement backed by her authoritative temper that Lindwyrm had no choice but to obey. It despised the smoke. The stench was rancid, even causing its eyes to burn from having the fumes blown into them directly, yet despite its clear discomfort and displeasure, for whatever reason it remained obedient to Ann’s command.

A low threatening growl welled up from deep within its throat, its body swelling as it towered above Ann in rage… and yet its bristling bravado was no more than an act, and despite their clear difference in size, there was never any doubt that Ann remained in control. Though it dwarfed her in size, its limbs and wings were pressed into its flank, neither fang or claw unsheathed. In fact, even its head was strangely lowered, almost as if the beast itself was unaware of its own submission.
In other words, it allowed Ann to hold on to her leash, though whether or not it ever had a choice was unclear, accepting her dominance despite its obvious reluctance.

If she wanted to be respected, whether by her own kind or by a twelve-foot tall dragon, she had to look like someone who deserved respect. That, and she was still frankly pissed with it.

Thankfully, the beast lowered its head and retracted its body in submission, as if to shrink itself in compliance. Ann&#39;s expression softened slightly in response.

&quot;Good.” She took a third, long puff of her cigarette before spitting it on the ground and crushing it under the sole of her boot, exhaling the smoke away from the dragon. &quot;I don&#39;t usually worry so much about these things, but if we&#39;re going to be together for a few weeks, I figured we should at least clarify some important points up front.&quot;

Maybe her words came through easier to it, or it felt the need to obey her even if it didn&#39;t want to. Whatever the reason, she was easily pushing the otherwise undisciplined and disrespectful dragon to bow its head and accept her words. She wasn&#39;t going to complain.

In their animated conversation, Ann ignored the biting cold that was slowly creeping over her body. The tips of her fingers and toes were reddening, as was the tip of her nose and cheeks, losing more and more feeling in her extremities with each passing second. She wasn&#39;t going to last much longer in her current state.

&quot;Fuck...&quot; She sniffed, bringing her hands to her bare forearms, furiously rubbing her skin for warmth. &quot;I&#39;m going to go get some warm clothes, and maybe some food too. I hope you didn&#39;t freeze <em>everything</em> in here.&quot;

She annoyingly turned her back on the creature and walked away, crunching more snow under her boots, her figure disappearing from view as she descended a frozen-still escalator to the lower levels of the mall.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The bride it had chosen, or rather, the woman that had chosen it was unlike any princess it had met in life. Strong-willed and stubborn, the brightness of what it assumed to be her courage chasing away the murky presence of her fear. To fetter Lindwyr so naturally on their first meeting, without any interference or assistance no less… it would not be wrong to say that she was by far the more imposing of the two.

Snorting once and shaking its head to rid itself of the remnants of the cigarette’s odor, Lindwyrm moved to where Ann had dropped the unpleasant object and proceeded to claw at it, digging a deep enough hole to bury it far enough so that it may never bother anyone again, sneezing a sheet of ice on top of the newly formed mound to seal it away for sure.
Having accomplished this important task, Lindwyrm left Ann to her own devices and began its own creeping journey to explore the mall, swallowing any particularly plump civilians on the way.
