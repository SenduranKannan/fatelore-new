Archie Richards had a plan.

His plan was straightforward and simple: wait for his old man to kick the bucket, inherit the last dregs of his magic crest, then live out the rest of his life in utter bliss. Fraternize, research, and procreate. Then the cycle would repeat, and anything after that...well, it wouldn&#39;t be <em>his</em> problem anymore.

Nowhere in the plan did it involve risking his life in any shape or form. Such as standing in the middle of a frozen lake, trying to invoke an ancient ritual that would swallow him whole, then spit out his bones after sapping his mana dry. Nor had he ever imagined taking up arms in a grand fiesta where mages from all over the world would compete against one another in a thinly veiled killing game, all for a shot at obtaining a Holy Grail.

Archie did not like to take risks. He had no use for a Holy Grail. 

What would he do with one, anyway? His life was cushy enough, and he had no desire for the Root. The Berenice Grail War wasn&#39;t the first Holy Grail War to grace the earth, nor would it be the last. If the Grail really could chart a convenient path to the Root, then surely, <em>someone</em> would have done it already.

So where was that someone, then? Those ambitious mages with their noble bloodlines, what had they managed to accomplish with the spoils of Grail Wars of the past?

Apparently, nothing worthy of note. Otherwise, the Mage&#39;s Association would be all over them like a pack of wolves.

Thus, it only reasoned that if any magus were to have a breakthrough, it would <em>not</em> be the unambitious Archie Richards. His life was already perfect, laid out in front of him in a clear, straight line. Why would he ever stray from the path?

Yet here he was.

In the end, he decided to keep the Command Seals. Didn&#39;t give them away, not to the Church, nor to someone who needed them more than him. He could&#39;ve gotten a sweet deal out of it, too.
<em> </em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 6:17 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086049264251183184 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086049264251183184><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 5:12 PM">5:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>So why didn&#39;t he do it?

Was it because he was a magus after all? Cursed by the blood flowing through his veins, always, inexorably salivating after the Root like Pavlov&#39;s trained dog, chasing after it like a moth to the flames, despite claiming otherwise?

Or did he think that he&#39;d get lucky, that the Grail hadn&#39;t chosen him by pure chance, that it had seen <em>something</em> in him, some latent ability that could push him up the food chain as far as magus families were concerned? 

Archie wasn&#39;t someone who could win the lottery on merits alone.

But what if—?

<em>(And that&#39;s how they get you.)</em>

Teeth chattering, Archie double-checked the patterns he had carved into the ice. 

Preparations were relatively easy. The mountains had an abundance of wildlife, and his high aptitude for Displacement Magecraft had made light work of gathering the necessary sacrifices. The lake also made the perfect canvas, large, circular, both shallow and high up the altitude enough to freeze halfway down the bottom. 

Then, last but not least, the catalyst.

As twilight descended upon the frozen lake, Archie shuffled closer to the center of the summoning array, holding a small, intricately carved wooden figurine. Scratches and grooves lined its surface, caused by years of handling. But despite its apparent age, the figurine had been preserved well, smelling faintly of sage and cedar oils.

Carefully, Archie placed the figurine on the ice, turning it so that the tribal patterns carved into its surface matched the ones that he had carved on the ice: the sun, the moon, and animal motifs each pointing in one of the four cardinal directions. Did the placement of the catalyst matter? He wasn&#39;t sure. But at this point, he may as well be a little superstitious. 

The <em>Appalachian mythology</em> was steeped in superstitious formalities anyway. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to pay some early respects to the natives of this land.

Recalling the words that had been prepared days in advance, he began his chant.

Wind howled across the lake. The air became charged with errant energy as Archie felt his mana being sapped into an invisible vortex. The summoning array began to glow, growing brighter with each verse inlayed on top of another. His Command Seals prickled, and his magic circuits seared as if he was being whittled by a thousand knives—

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

A bullet whizzed past him, lodging itself in the lake and sending shards of ice flying in every direction. Archie barely had time to shield his face—

<em><strong>BANGBANG!</strong></em>

A second and a third shot immediately followed, but both of them went wild and disappeared into the woods beyond the lake. He scrambled for the nearest cover—

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>&#39;Lachlan, what the fuck!&#39;</strong>

His assailant - or <em>assailants</em>, rather - weren&#39;t exactly hiding. Standing at the edge of the lake, basking in the dim light of the setting sun were two familiar faces, neither of whom he had seen since the day of the funeral. Roland was dressed in a dark emerald suit, while Lachlan was clad in his trademark, long dark coat, his red hair providing a stark relief from the blackness.

Archie was livid. He squinted at the two figures, as if trying to shoot daggers with his eyes. &#39;What the hell!&#39; He started, hand going inside his coat where he&#39;d carried several blades. &#39;What are you doing? This isn&#39;t a goddamned shooting range!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;So, what have you got here?&#39; He feigned ignorance, tilting his head towards the summoning array. The glow that had briefly occupied the space had all but vanished. What little energy that had begun to gather in the air dissipated until all that was left was the sharp, dry wind.

He placed one foot on the ice, put his weight on it, and tested his balance. Dozens of feet away, Archie&#39;s lips moved inaudibly. A small dagger appeared out of thin air, lodging itself in the ice a scant two inches away from his shoe.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan offered a smile, but it was crooked and strangely uncanny. The skin on his face didn&#39;t quite stretch to the corner of his eyes. 

&#39;After catching wind of you taking an extended vacation at this time of the year, it was only a matter of time before I figured out what you were up to.

Griffin was the easiest target. But now that he&#39;s gone, you need a <em>replacement</em>. Bleier is the worst one out of all of us, and that makes him the best candidate.&#39;

He watched as a series of expressions finally managed to contort Lachlan&#39;s face, each one leaving him more shaken than before. 

&#39;Hit the nail on the head, did I?&#39; He sneered. &#39;I swear, you puppeteers are all messed up there. But now that we&#39;ve graduated, I don&#39;t have to deal with it anymore. You and I, we are done.&#39;

He aimed the second dagger at Lachlan&#39;s chest. &#39;Get out,&#39; he said as his circuits flared to life. &#39;I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re here to spectate or what. Bleier may be a coward, but I won&#39;t be sorry to see you go.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The lake was eerily quiet save for the echoes of their voice, but something was there, a dark, heavy presence looming over him and weighing him down. He couldn&#39;t sense any disturbance in the air, in the flow of mana that always surrounded them. But were his eyes really open?

He realized that he&#39;d never taken a good look at the Dowling&#39;s magecraft while they were still in school. How did the twins control their familiars?

<s><em>kill him</em></s>
<em>run</em>

Two thoughts sprang up simultaneously, tearing his mind in two. Archie opened his mouth to mutter an incantation, and his world turned upside down. 

Blackness. Then, red.

His face hit the ice as his legs were swept out from under him, leaving a bloody dent where his skin broke from the impact. In a split second he was dangling a few inches above the ice, held at the ankles by an elongated arm that had slithered across the lake from the darkness of the woods.

Blood streamed from his nostrils and a fractured eye socket. He fired up his circuits once more and severed the meaty tendril in two. Scrambling to his knees, Archie looked through his one good eye towards the puppeteer, where he had dispatched both of his daggers—

&#39;That was the single stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever seen you do.&#39;

&#39;Lachlan&#39; approached him, one dagger protruding from his chest while another jutting out from the space between his eyes. The severed nerves sent his eyes spinning in their sockets until both of them rolled into the back of his head. He knelt down besides Archie and Archie, being in such close proximity, finally realized his mistake.

He had been talking to a <strong>puppet </strong>all this time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A second Lachlan detached himself from the shadows of the woods beyond, closing in on Archie with a horde of what can only be described as human-sized creepy crawlies. The most distinctive features on their bodies were their limbs, stretched beyond what was possible through human genetics and each sporting various degrees of wear and tear. The horde had been tirelessly searching the mountains for signs of the young Richards; now they had been recalled and joined in on the celebration.

A puppet with spider-like appendages pinned Archie to the ground, securing not only his limbs, but squeezing his trachea just enough to let him know to not attempt anything stupid. Lachlan knelt beside him, clutching both daggers in his hands.

&#39;Not that I&#39;ve given you many chances in the first place,&#39; the puppeteer lightly slapped Archie&#39;s face with the flat side of his own blades. &#39;You rely too much on dowsing. Mana can only be traced if there was magecraft at work in the first place.&#39;

Carefully, he slid the daggers back into the holsters under Archie&#39;s coat. &#39;All nice and tidy,&#39; he said to a pair of eyes glowering up at him. &#39;Don&#39;t be so dramatic. You lost, so take it in stride.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Without looking he called out, &#39;Roland!&#39;

The blonde stumbled out from behind the trees, nursing a sore spot where puppet-Lachlan had hit him while clutching a small, wooden figurine in his other hand. Carefully treading around the patterns on the ice, he placed the effigy gingerly in the center of the array.

&#39;You are amazing in your own right,&#39; Lachlan commented as Roland finally left the array to stand beside him. &#39;You&#39;ve missed the obvious target back there but somehow hit the bullseye. It&#39;s a miracle that you didn&#39;t break it in half.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But no matter. A damaged relic is still a relic. The significance still holds.&#39; Lachlan walked the edge of the summoning array until it was positioned right between him and Archie. Archie was still flinging curses at him, but it sounded like music to his ears.

Picking up a shard of ice, he sliced open the palm of his own hand and let a rivulet of blood flow into the summoning array, mixing into the sacrifices Archie had already fed into its grooves.

His own magic circuits were rested, his store of mana abundant. Unlike Archie, he didn&#39;t need to budget around his so-called &#39;familiars&#39;, for controlling his puppets required but a trickle of mana. The brunt of the work had already been done in the days, months, and <em>years</em> before.

A Dowling magus always prepares in advance. All it costed was a bit of his own sanity. <em>Every single time.</em>

But he no longer had a need of that.

Lachlan James Dowling stared ahead. <strong>&#39;Now, you too can experience what it&#39;s like to have your future taken away,&#39;</strong> he spoke fondly at Archie&#39;s struggling form, then reached for his mental trigger.

And continued from where Archie had left off.

At least, before Lachlan came to tread on his dreams. The sacrifices were plenty, but new blood had been spilled. The witching hour had come and gone. It was far too late to replicate whatever summon Archie had attempted in the first place, even with the proper catalyst. This land did not belong to Lachlan. Nor did this Servant. He stole, pillaged, usurped, for it was all he had known as a child.

The ice started to crack a bit. Lachlan wondered if he had put on weight, or if perhaps the puppets had grown swollen and fat from a lack of maintenance. He knew that was unlikely and what came next confirmed that for him. The cold wind had gone dry and he felt a thick smell of sulphur in the air. It was revolting, like piss in a farm. Dust filled his surroundings and dirt got in his eyes. The wooden figurine stood in the center, surrounded by Dowling blood that had now frozen solid around its old exterior.

<em>crack</em>

Despite these odd occurrences, there was no point in delaying the ritual further. The heir to the Dowling family continued. As he did, the statue showed signs of strain, surrounded by streaks of delicate ice about to break. A summoning circle then manifested itself, forming a delicate pattern that resembled a snowflake. The lake was trembling from the sheer amount of mana pooling out.

<em>crack crack</em>

Eventually, the statue cracked completely.

<em><strong>STOMP!</strong></em>

To be more accurate, a black figure stepped on it. It broke, brittle as glass. Streaks emerged from the impact surface, gradually spreading across the lake as Lachlan wondered if it was safe to still stand on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086100709818253385 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086100709818253385><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 8:36 PM">8:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The stench that followed woke him back to his senses. It was an aroma of death, something that he had seen far too often to ignore. He could smell the stench of corpses in the air, emanating from the tall figure that had erupted from the statue&#39;s remains. They were pure black, covered in layers of red and white. Their body looked designed to hurt, with spikes, edges and sharp points emerging from every possible crevice. Leather boots, pants and gauntlets that were more prickly than a cactus. A coat that had been long worn and reeked of mud. Bullets and ammunition surrounded the phantom&#39;s body, hinting at the pair of handguns that they held in each hand. To top it all off, a gigantic hat with skulls circled around it that reminded Lachlan of some exotic cultures he had heard about. Tales from Louisiana. Folktales spread around by old slave descendants.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086100855557730364 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086100855557730364><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 8:37 PM">8:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="discord_assets/SPOILER_GS-8-Panel-4F1F7.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/SPOILER_GS-8-Panel-4F1F7.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_GS-8-Panel.png (1.85 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

But he wouldn&#39;t be sleeping no more. Not until he got to the bottom of all this.

His eyes flashed green, chains rattling as a miasma of death surrounded his wake. He was fresh and excited from the summon, his mana reserves currently being at their peak. Lachlan almost couldn&#39;t tell that he was looking at a human being. The gunslinger&#39;s entire body was covered in darkness from head to toe. Even his face was an obfuscation, being a black solid mask that showed no discernable features.

Not like Bill had much to say. His chains stopped moving as he took a second to gain awareness of his surroundings. Closest to him was some dude with red hair. Next to him, another, scrawnier kid with the body language of a beaten cow. Even further beyond was what caught his eye: A horde of terrific looking puppets, surrounding a disfigured man from all sides. Then, another odd puppet with visible injuries that gave him a strong case of deja vu whenever he saw it.

&quot;Hehehe.&quot;

Bill didn&#39;t say a word. Just an awkward snicker. The type you would do when your pal told you a crappy joke, but you laughed anyway to not hurt their feelings. Small traces of a smile appeared through the gunman&#39;s mask, much to Lachlan&#39;s confusion. What was so funny-

<em>thwip</em>

Without warning, the Servant raised his guns and aimed them sideways, forming a cross shape with the barrels.

<em>BANG!</em>

Lachlan froze. The body reacted on instinct, performing a self check. No visible injuries were discerned. Instead, if he turned around, he would see that one of his puppets now had a gaping hole in it.

<em>BANG! BANG!</em>

And now it was being pushed back by the sheer force of the bullets, along with being turned into a pincushion of abuse.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086100942023311451 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086100942023311451><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 8:37 PM">8:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill kept firing, switching targets here and there to vary things up. All of the puppets were now riddled with holes in the span of three seconds, the Lachlan puppet being the last to receive three bullet straight to the skull, two the heart and five to the crotch. The other puppets had similar injuries, with shots aimed towards where one would find human vitals. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A sickeningly strong scent suffused the air all around him. It was the smell of sulfur. Not that he was familiar enough with the stink of gunpowder to immediately recognize it, but the chemical&#39;s foul tang was sharp on his tongue, and the taste reminded him of <em>home</em>.

Doors that wouldn&#39;t open.
Locks that wouldn&#39;t break.
Incandescent lights and bleached walls.
Monsters. Breathing down his neck.

<em><strong>STOMP!</strong></em>

The wooden effigy shattered, replaced by a presence that was neither man nor beast. An unprecedented pressure seized him, threatening to split his skull, to crush his spine, to swallow him whole in a murky, dark substance that seemed to devour light itself. The summoning ritual bridged the land of the dead and the living. Spat out the presence of death, personified.

<em>He had brought forth another monster.</em>

In a hysterical bout of laughter, the puppeteer curbed his fear to the corner of his mind. He glared at Archie, not unlike a beast who had cornered their prey himself. 

<strong>&#39;Look at him!&#39;</strong> He roared, triumphant. &#39;Take a good look at what you&#39;ve lost—&#39;

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

Lachlan froze. Felt his magic circuits fire up, mana siphoned through an invisible straw. The red-clad figure he had summoned drew out a pair of guns and, without warning, pulled the trigger. 

Under any other circumstances, Lachlan would have been furious. How dare they finish the job before he could gloat? He had orchestrated an entire event to make Archie suffer. How dare they deprive him of that pleasure?!

But the bullet wasn&#39;t meant for Archie.

Ice cracked under his feet as he stomped his way towards the black menace, fist raised in an attempt to grab hold of the chains on the Servant&#39;s coat and yank on it like a leash.

Shots to the lungs around twenty times. The trachea, thirty. The intestine, forty. He expected guts to be spilling around any second now, only for the puppets to keep shambling, albeit in a mutilated state. Bullets were supposed to be efficient: One bullet for a life. One hell of a bargain. Except that didn&#39;t seem to mean shit to these ghoulish sacks of meat.

Then some redhead showed up in his vision, getting in the way of his sights and giving him mild annoyance. Bill grunted, lowering his gun for a few seconds as Lachlan got closer. He would have normally shot him on the spot, especially someone looking as pale and well off as him. However, he could sense a familiar warmth whenever his eyes crossed Lachlan, like a needle being pulled into a thread or a door fitting a frame. If Lachlan were to disappear, Bill knew for a fact that he would cease to exist soon afterwards. This sort of sensation could only mean one thing.

The heir to the Dowling family was not amused by the Servant&#39;s antics. Did they know how insulting they were being? How much of a sin they had committed by stealing <em>his</em> thunder?

<em>rattle rattle</em>

Bill was slightly nudged as the man tugged the Servant by the chains, dragging him forward like a trained mutt. Lachlan stared at him from below due to the discrepancy in height between the two. The Master was furious, having a few choice words to say-

As Lachlan spoke, he suddenly felt the impact of Bill&#39;s palm clasped around his face. He grabbed at him like a ball, holding him by the cheeks as he casually shoved him aside.

&quot;Yo, don&#39;t do no stupid shit. Shut up and lemme work.&quot;

The man fired more shots, but this time they weren&#39;t aimed towards the puppets. One bullet pierced Archie&#39;s tongue, heading straight for the mouth and emerging from the back of the man&#39;s neck. The other pierced the nose, swimming right up the nostril and emerging from the eye sockets. The last one hit the skull, spreading bone matter and neurons all around the icy lake as the bullet completely lodged itself in the man&#39;s cranium. The magus known as Archie was no more.

&quot;There. Easy. That guy was a mage, right? His weird ass familiars should be leaving. Any second now.&quot; Bill said, exuding utmost confidence in his judgment. It took a few seconds for him to realize that the puppets hadn&#39;t vanished. They remained still, motionless, but they weren&#39;t gone. It was only when the Lachlan imitation shuffled towards him that he reacted.

<em>BANG!</em>

A bullet to the neck.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Followed by several more, aimed towards the same spot. The pressure was intense, like an axe, enough to decapitate it and have its disembodied head roll towards Lachlan&#39;s shoes.

<em>&quot;Motherfucker.&quot;</em> Bill cursed, irritated. &quot;These things don&#39;t quit. Master, what you standing around for?!

He was unremarkable as a magus, and plain as a human. He bleached his hair at fifteen years of age in order to set himself apart from the rest of his family, but his sister dyed hers neon blue two weeks later, and he went back to being the resident wallflower.

He kept the look. Blonde hair looked great with dark suits. And dark suits made him look professional. It made him look as if he belonged in the spot at Lachlan&#39;s side, a diligent assistant, a loyal servant. It was a symbol of status - to an outsider, that is.

Deep down, Roland knew he didn&#39;t deserve the role. He wasn&#39;t an achiever, but he did know how to survive. A singular redeeming quality that enabled him to endure Lachlan&#39;s dictatorship and then some: the ability to read the room.

He knew things were bad right away. 

The Servant Lachlan had summoned had acted without permission. Even issued the Master some nonsensical commands himself. Familiars? Horses? What was he talking about? Couldn&#39;t he see that none of the puppets had attacked? Couldn&#39;t he hear his Master&#39;s interrogation, feel the chains rattling his chest? When Roland had left the mansion unprompted to replenish the tea in the pantry, Lachlan had locked him out for a whole day and night, and even thrown in a few puppets to chase him around for sport.

Seeing the very same puppets pop like bloated corn kernels should have, by all means, given him a stab of euphoria. But in actuality, all it did was make him angry.

<em>(Angry at whom?)</em>

He waited. Any second now...</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 2:39 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Roland&#39;s master did not disappoint. Bill had his fill of fun, but his stunt was received by utter silence. Lachlan&#39;s face reflected in his pale green sockets, wide-eyed and unmoving.

Fist shaking. The strain of holding back a terrible rage. If he could execute Bill right here and now, he would do it without a second thought. He&#39;d already envisioned it, three strokes of command seals shot straight into the Servant&#39;s head. The first to restrain. The second to cause terrible pain. And the last to slay. 

There was just one glaring issue with that plan.

&#39;...Are you stupid?&#39; He whispered, breath frosting in the cold and jaw hurting from where Bill had squeezed his face. Five red marks across his pale skin. The stark difference between him and the newest monster he had to tame.

Subdue them.
Control them.
<strong>Handle your fears!</strong>

&#39;Have you not heard what I said?&#39; He continued to speak slowly, making sure that each and every word was properly heard by the faceless Servant. &#39;These <em>&quot;things&quot;</em> belong to me. You have not only killed my hounds, but also stole <em>my</em> prey!&#39;

He jerked his head towards where Archie&#39;s body lay, a mangled, bloody mess.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 2:48 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086732230551945337 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086732230551945337><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 2:25 PM">2:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Huh.&quot; He replied, scratching the back of his head with his gun. &quot;Is that so? Could have told me earlier.&quot; He said, much to Lachlan&#39;s frustration. He then looked back to Archie, who was as dead as a doornail. Poor sob probably didn&#39;t even get a chance to realize that they were dead.

&quot;Alright then. No need for a horsie. Thank the spirits.&quot; Bill sighed with relief, shaking his head and arching his back. He stretched a bit, like someone who had just woken up from an uncomfortable sleep in a cold bed. To be fair, they were standing on a frozen lake.

It took them a whole minute to notice the discontent in Lachlan&#39;s face.

&quot;You got a problem, Master? You are <em>my</em> Master, right?&quot; He asked, inquisitive. He sized Lachlan up, head to toe. Then glanced behind him.

&quot;Or is it the kid behind you? You both look kind of the same to me.&quot; He spun his hand in a so-so manner, referring to Roland. &quot;Well kid? Speak up.

Once the magus was done talking, the outlaw rubbed his hands together and pointed at him.

&quot;You must be my Master then. You can tell from the tone.&quot; He joked while still rubbing his hands, firmer this time. &quot;You&#39;re bossy. You&#39;re rude. Proper Master material right here.&quot; Despite the mask, there was no doubt that Bill was smiling at Lachlan with every word from his mouth.

&quot;And as for your question. I mean,&quot; He released the grip on his hands, spreading his arms wide and tilting his head left and right, motioning for his Master to observe their surroundings. A half cracked lake. A dead Archie. A mutilated puppet and several more riddled with bullet holes.

He pushed past the Servant, coming to stand at the peripheral of his most recent act of manslaughter. Blood poured openly from the numerous bullet holes Bill had pumped into his victims, too plentiful to freeze into solid mass. It stuck to the bottom of Lachlan&#39;s shoe, making squelching noises with each step he took. The young Master grimaced in mild disgust.

Nevertheless, he slid the tip of his shoe under Archie&#39;s mutilated face, turning it over in the budding moonlight to imprint the visage in his mind. While he had been robbed of the pleasure of seeing to Archie&#39;s end himself, tonight still marked a monumental step towards the restoration of peace. His peace.

He moved on to his puppets next, taking his time to examine Bill&#39;s handiwork closely. Each shot had been made with deadly precision, designed to waste no time to let its target bleed to death. Archie had likely perished before his head hit the ground. His puppets would have too, had they been designed with <strong>normal human anatomy</strong> in mind.

He turned around to face his Servant. &#39;<em>Anyone</em> can pump lead into an unmoving target. Roland can do it, so long as he keeps his eyes peeled.&#39; 

His eyes caught a glimpse of Roland skulking in the back, hand unconsciously gripping the slight bulge in his pocket. The gun he had lent him, still with two bullets left. He could hazard a guess at what Roland was thinking right now: hoping that he wouldn&#39;t need to fire them again for the rest of the night. 

Too bad.

The reunion with Archie seemed to have stirred Lachlan up more than usual, and Bill&#39;s attitude was decidedly <em>not</em> helping. 

So much for trying to make himself the smaller target.

He just nodded along and stepped aside, letting his handiwork speak instead. Of course, his Master did not praise him, nor did he seemed pleased, but he couldn&#39;t deny the brutal efficiency of the Servant&#39;s methods. Replace his puppets with more conventional targets and Bill&#39;s M.O. could only be described as a slaughter done right.

&quot;Is that so? Well, I&#39;ll be damned.&quot; Bill shrugged at Lachlan&#39;s acidic words, holstering his pistol and placing his hands on his waist. A commanding pose. He adjusted his hat as he overheard Lachlan&#39;s command, directed towards Roland. He turned his head, looking at the other kid which seemed to be as fidgety as a mouse. The mutilated puppet also started to rise back up, clearly incited to move by its owner.

But Roland brought back attention to himself. <strong>&quot;Archer.</strong> Not my name, my class. Obviously.&quot; Bill laughed. &quot;But you may know me as <strong>Cherokee Bill.</strong> Or at least, that&#39;s what I think they called me. They might call me something else now.&quot; He shook his head.

&quot;And if you got problems with my work, then it&#39;s just like me old granny used to say. You want something done right? Do it yourself. C&#39;mon boy.&quot; He waved at Roland. &quot;Your boss seems to have high hopes for you. Would be a shame to let him down. Now, if you&#39;d be so inclined.&quot; He kept waving, motioning for Roland to do something.

For generations, young boys had dreamed of the Wild West and the gunslingers who roamed its dusty plains. Roland was no different. He still had old books tucked away in a box in his parents&#39; basement, stories of the likes of Jesse James and Billy the Kid. His little cowboy&#39;s hat and wooden gun buried at the bottom of his old toy box. 

Boys and adventures, name a better combo.

Of course, as he grew up, Roland gradually learned that reality hit much, much harder than the romanticized fantasies of the Wild West. The time for imagination was over, the boundless energy his childhood self possessed had all but dissipated. It no longer felt cool to wave a gun around, as every time he did, the consequences would attach itself to his legs, dragging him down into a bottomless void...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Cherokee Bill,&#39; he said blankly, caught off-guard by Roland&#39;s reaction. <strong>&#39;Who is that?&#39;</strong>

It wasn&#39;t as if he hadn&#39;t had a childhood. His childhood was simply different. He had never experienced life as Roland had before they both enrolled at school. For Roland, there was a clearly defined turning point, the day of his enrollment that had marked the beginning of his life as a magus. For Lachlan, magecraft spanned his entire life. 

He did have a few guilty pleasures, but they were sparse compared to what Roland enjoyed. A few months after Roland had moved into the Dowling mansion, he had turned an entire spare room into a game room, stuffed full of consoles and plastic boxes the likes of which Lachlan had never known. 

He still didn&#39;t quite grasp the joy of pressing buttons and watching pixels explode on a TV screen. What was so exciting about watching colored polygons raiding tombs™️ when he could simply fly over to the pyramids and do it himself?

Suffice to say, he shared little of the joys (he couldn&#39;t tell Roland was actually hyperventilating from a distance) Roland had displayed as the Servant revealed their identity. However, he was pleased to hear one thing.

&#39;It <em>would</em> be a shame to let me down.&#39; He crossed his own arms, waiting for Roland to make a move. &#39;For once, I am inclined to agree.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 11:32 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cowboy didn&#39;t seem to mind however, being more focused on the spat between the two men. He barely knew them, but he could tell that there was some animosity between the two. A very one sided relationship, like that of farmers and cattle.

&quot;Clean up? I mean, we could just leave. Dump the body in the lake. No one will give a fuck.&quot; Bill laughed, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;But I&#39;m bored, so-&quot;

<em>thwip</em>

The surprises weren&#39;t over for Lachlan, who felt something firm and hard strike his head and damage his perfect hairline. It fell to his laps as he instinctively grabbed an all too familiar shape in his hands. He opened his eyes and saw what he was holding: A gun. Bill&#39;s gun, to be precise.

Bill then clapped his hands thrice and pointed towards Roland.

&quot;There you go. That&#39;s your target. If you&#39;re really as good as me, then killing my Master shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot; Bill then glanced back to Lachlan and tipped his hat at him. &quot;And, if you really want to show me that you&#39;re my Master, then putting down that dog of yours should be a piece of cake. Right?&quot; He grinned crossing his fingers and taking a seat on a nearby rock, sitting cross legged.

The romance of a shootout, two outlaws facing each other in the middle of a deserted street, eyes locked in a fierce gaze. Hot sun beating down on their backs. Long shadows on the ground. With Bill lending his gun to his Master, every element had been replicated, with the silver sheen of the moonlight adding even a mysterious touch to the set. 

To Cherokee Bill, the scene that was about to unfurl was no more than business as usual. Only pussies fought with words; real men spoke with metal, slick with the brain matter of their foe. To Roland Bleier, however... 

It was akin to reliving a nightmare.

The blonde shook his head. He stammered numbly as he watched Lachlan examine the gun that had quite literally landed in his lap. &#39;Don&#39;t listen to Lachy, I&#39;m actually terrible at this. There&#39;s no need, <strong>there&#39;s fucking nothing to escalate!</strong> I was just making a suggestion!&#39; 

How did they come by such a nutcase?! He glared down at Bill, who had shirked himself of all responsibility and played deaf on a rock. He swung his gaze back to Lachlan, and watched with curling dread as the man engrossed himself in his shiny new toy.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 4:52 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Everything had gone astray the moment he had hijacked Archie&#39;s summon. He never knew that Archie had it in him to want to contract with someone so...

Violent?
Unhinged?
No...

<em>&#39;Idiotic,&#39;</em> he said, holding Bill&#39;s gun steady as he leveled it at the Servant himself. &#39;Guns are to gunslingers as blades are to samurais. Casually handing away your livelihood,&#39; his lips curled, &#39;Why, I didn&#39;t take an outlaw to be such a charitable soul.&#39;

The weight of the gun dragged his hand down as he aimed. It was too heavy for his liking, and nowhere near as wieldy as his modded seven-shooter. His hands were already straining from holding onto it for a scant few seconds. But was he ever the type to back down from a challenge?

&#39;Lucky for you, I still have further need of your services.&#39; He pivoted the gun away from Bill, and trained it on his other, lesser servant.

&#39;As for you,&#39; he cocked his head to one side, so he could give Roland a full, unimpeded view of his unmarred face. &#39;I <em>did</em> tell you to shoot.

Of course, his Master then pointed it back to Roland. After all, a Servant would always be more valuable to a Master than any other lackey in the world. 

&quot;Well, I got two arms, two legs, and a heart of gold. So long as I have all that, you can shove my gun up your butt for all I care.&quot; Bill shrugged, chuckling at Lachlan&#39;s speech about a gunslinger&#39;s livelihood. He was far, far older than the two kids, yet that speech felt so antiquated that he found it laughable all the same.

&quot;Now, since you two seem to be in the mood, I assume you&#39;re ready? Set? Good.&quot;

He raised three fingers in the air, then started counting down.

&quot;One,&quot;

The wind passed by, sending shivers down Lachlan and Roland&#39;s fingers.

&quot;Two,&quot;

The ice rattled from the pressure of their shoes.

<strong>&quot;Three.&quot;</strong> The twitch of the puppet corpses could be heard. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had no choice, he told himself. His hands were tied. Lachlan had his life on a leash, plus he owed the man another. It took a gargantuan amount of effort but he emptied his head of thought, of fear, and of doubt, a barely cogitative state where he no longer knew if he was still controlling his body or if he had relented it to some cosmic force and resumed watching from the backseat.

It was better this way. Easier, because when he felt the joints of his finger curl around the trigger, he didn&#39;t know if his own mind had willed it, or if his hand was simply executing an order on autopilot, free of responsibility and blame. 

It had to be the latter, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t be able to live with himself. 

A single shot rang out. Echoed across the lake, square in the chest of the zombie-esque imitation of the Dowling heir. A fresh hole appeared on the puppet as the bullet blew out its spine. Gore splattered the ice and the puppet&#39;s torso bent backwards, no longer able to support itself with so many missing chunks of muscle and bone. Eventually, the body snapped under the strain, folded in half, and crumbled to the ground.

Roland breathed hard. Shakily, he reclaimed his body, then fell over and retched. His brain told him the <em>thing</em> he had shot was no more than another monster. His heart, however, told him he had just killed another man.

Not once. <em>Twice.</em> The same man that had appeared in his nightmares time and time again. 

<strong>&#39;Satisfied?&#39;</strong> He said miserably, shivering into his suit. &#39;I did as you asked. I shot him—<em>it</em>. Are you finally impressed now?&#39;

He looked up, and found himself staring into the shiny, dark muzzle of Cherokee Bill&#39;s gun, pointed straight at his head.

&#39;Lachlan?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When Bill tossed him the gun, Lachlan immediately knew what was expected of him. He had been conditioned to excel, and his eagerness showed. After all, what better chance to establish some much needed authority over his new underling than to prove himself at their own game? It did take one monster to tame another, and he was used to wearing someone else&#39;s skin. 

But was he ready to finally let Roland go? 

Lachlan weighed his options. Despite the bad blood between them, Roland had remained loyal and proven his worth over the years. What he had lacked as a magus, he had more than made up for with knowledge - knowledge that Lachlan had coveted. When they weren&#39;t trying to one-up one another, they worked quite well. Lachlan would act in the front line and Roland would provide assistance from the back. 

Cleanup. Management. Chores. Starting up the car in the middle of the night and driving them both to the nearest IHOP because he fancied pancakes at 3am. To lose someone that was so unremarkably <em>resourceful</em> just so he could demonstrate his resolve to a Servant who was most likely treating it as some kind of game—

He can do it. He <em>would</em> do it, a thousand times yes. Who needs resourcefulness when he could trade it all for <em>strength</em>?

Even if it was only a fleeting strength made possible by the Grail.

When he opened them again, they were no longer the eyes of a burgeoning heir who was worried about personal gains and losses, but the eyes of a survivor who would do anything to take back what was rightfully theirs. A sense of calm washed over him as a single spell activated through his circuits, guaranteeing his success: it no longer mattered where he had placed his heart, because those hands of his would no longer miss their mark.

One shot, one life. 

He fired on the count of three.

...But nothing happened.

No crack of a bullet piercing his eardrums, no shockwave coursing through his body. Cherokee Bill&#39;s gun sagged in his hands, nothing more than a cold piece of metal. Baffled, Lachlan attempted to fire again, but the trigger remained unmoving, refusing to budge under his command.

He couldn&#39;t do it. He couldn&#39;t fire it. The gun wouldn&#39;t let him. He had been tricked!

<strong>&#39;You!&#39;</strong> The Dowling heir struggled to keep his face straight and his emotions under control. The spell was broken, and he finally lowered his arms, both of which had overexerted themselves from carrying a Servant&#39;s weapon. He was torn between demanding that Bill unlock his gun, and sending him back to the Throne for toying with him. Indecision dried up the words in his chest.

<em>&#39;Lachlan?&#39;</em>

Lachlan continued to glare at Bill, all of his confusion and outrage projected at his Servant. He was not ready to face Roland.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 1:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087448044171165820 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087448044171165820><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 1:50 PM">1:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill took a deep, long sigh. It felt refreshing to hear the sound of a gun being fired that didn&#39;t come from him. He could feel the smell of smoke and heat rapturing through the flesh of an unlucky target. The Lachlan puppet spurted out more blood splatters before it eventually went quiet.

Lachlan instead looked shocked, his face contorting into a vicious snarl as he immediately turned to Bill, glaring at him with a look that could kill.

&quot;So, what happened there?&quot; The cowboy asked while adjusting his hat. &quot;Didn&#39;t fire? Oh well. Guess you actually had a point back there when you were talking about guns being my livelihood. Not something you can easily steal. I see, I see.&quot; He giggled.

&quot;Well, chin up. We live and learn.&quot; He then turned to Roland. &quot;And as for you, good shoot! Bravo!&quot; Archer stood up, clapping his hands twice as he walked towards Lachlan, but still maintained eye contact with the Dowling&#39;s pet.

&quot;Now, I wouldn&#39;t call this a fair duel, but I have to say: Kid&#39;s a natural. This might just be a trick of the light, but Master, <strong>I do believe they drew their gun faster than you.&quot;</strong>

It was an off hand remark. Something that Bill casually spewed out while motioning for Lachlan to return the gun back to him. Yet this small statement held volumes of weight to Lachlan. Roland was faster than him? According to his own Servant?

&quot;Now then,&quot; Bill crossed his fingers. &quot;once you&#39;re done admiring my gun, can we get a move on? Y&#39;all just wanna stand here while I&#39;m butt naked in the snow?&quot; He stomped around the icy lake, threatening to shatter it with the edge of his spurs. &quot;I lived in the desert, not in Antarctica for Pete&#39;s sake.&quot; He flapped his coat around, suggesting that it wasn&#39;t ideal for the weather. Granted, a Servant didn&#39;t care for their environment, since their mana bodies were meant to withstand all sorts of temperatures. But Cherokee Bill certainly felt very attuned to their inner humanity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087497695431774249 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087497695431774249><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 20, 2023 5:07 PM">5:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I&#39;ve seen what I wanted to see: You two have guts.

A rage ten years old, a rage that had passed through so many shapes and colors but right here, right now, had been reduced to a thought that had been honed to a needle point. After everything, he was still trapped like a rat in a cage, his efforts reduced to nothing but a performance in the eyes of men who held authority over him. 

Bill turned his back on the young puppeteer. For a brief moment, the image of his back overlapped with that of Lachlan&#39;s father, the bright red coat reminiscent of the fiery red hair that had always characterized the current Dowling family&#39;s head. It was a sight that was incredibly familiar to him. One that he had not expected to revisit so soon.

Neither of them had eyes for him. 

The ease with which Bill had dismissed him, the nonchalance with which he had sowed the seeds of disparity, the shamelessness with which he had sworn absolute obedience, even as he acted as if he conducted this show—

It was a perverted generosity that could only be afforded by those who wielded power and knew how to abuse it.

<em>&#39;My god, Griffin. How bad do you have to be to flub this spectacularly?&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;Nice try. But don&#39;t forget who&#39;s the one in charge. From now on, let&#39;s just stick to what you&#39;re good at, okay?&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;Since you&#39;re so eager, why don&#39;t you put on a show for all of us? Don&#39;t be shy, no one&#39;s waiting anyway.&#39;</em>

It was a never-ending cycle. Scale one mountain, and another would follow. They&#39;d give him a bit of freedom, a taste of the view from the top, just enough to keep him invested, but always with the knowledge that they could take it away at any moment. And he&#39;d have no choice but to comply.

But things were a bit different between him and Bill. 

Lachlan waited until Bill had marched to the opposite end of the lake.

He then held out Bill&#39;s gun—

And dropped it onto the ice.

<em>crack</em>

The weight of a Servant&#39;s weapon, coupled with the force that had been gained from the freefall, caused even more cracks to form on the already brittle ice. The butt of the gun had even broken through the crust and sank halfway beneath the surface.

But that wasn&#39;t all. 

A bloody, round shadow roused itself from the pile of corpses: a puppet with limbs still attached to its body wrapped itself up like a cannonball, then smashed into the frozen lake where its master had dropped the gun. It crashed through easily, hurling water and ice into the air as both puppet and gun sank towards the bottom of the lake.

Normally, the surface of the lake should not have been able to handle so much abuse. But curiously, the fractures stopped several inches around the hole that had been created by the puppet. Lachlan kept his feet firmly planted on the lake, even as Roland let out a cry of panic and scrambled for landmass.

<strong>&#39;Fetch.&#39;</strong> The puppeteer tapped his foot as he beckoned his Servant, emboldened by the <strong>reinforcement</strong> spell he had executed on the ice around him. &#39;If you are so good at following orders, then why not take a skinny dip and prove it to me right now? Dogs love swimming, or so I have read.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087861974039273582 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087861974039273582><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 21, 2023 5:15 PM">5:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

From the Cook gang, strangers on the road, fellow Cherokee natives and his own mother. He never regretted a single lesson that he had learned, for they had prepared him for all walks in life.

The modern world had changed, but the lessons still applied. Especially with people like the Dowling heir.

<em>crack</em>

Perhaps he wasn&#39;t paying attention, but Bill looked rather shocked through his mask as he turned around and found the lake partially cracked. A puppet shuffled down, burying itself in the abyss and dragging down his gun with it. The icy surface was gradually dissolving, returning to its original liquid form. Roland was struggling to find his footing, while Lachlan remained, standing proud. His orders were crystal clear.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll say.&quot; Bill laughed, adjusting his hat and covering his gaze. &quot;That&#39;s rather unfortunate.&quot; He gripped the edge of it and then tossed it aside, revealing a formless, bald head covered by his mask.

&quot;It seems like my Master is a proper slob, unable to even take ahold of my gun without losing it.&quot; He shrugged, taking off his clothes in a very human like fashion. Lachlan questioned this approach: Why would a Servant care about removing their clothes with the existence of a non corporeal form? It felt almost mocking to see Bill completely remove any garments of himself, remaining an enigmatic black and white figure. He could see fingertips and toes, but couldn&#39;t tell which parts were still cloth.

That mockery turned into shock as Lachlan gazed at Bill&#39;s body. Bullet holes, scratches, signs of whippings and a strange mark around his neck. That body had endured more abuse than he had in a trillion lifetimes. For Roland it would be around a million. Yet here the cowboy was, whistling casually as they tested the lake water with their toes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088222809756532867 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088222809756532867><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 22, 2023 5:08 PM">5:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Once again, should have summoned someone else. Brrrr.&quot; He faltered in the cold, but then pushed himself down.

<em>SPLASH!</em>

All that remained in the water was bubbles. Bill sank deeper down, observing the puppet and getting closer. The gun was next to it, he thought, and he would be correct. He grabbed it swiftly, before it reached the bottom and then swam for the surface. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For some, rules held their community together, kept them safe, and kept order among their kind. For others, rules oppressed, restricted, and placed constraints on their freedom. They believed that rules were meant to be broken, and that they stood in the way of progress.

For Lachlan, rules gave him purpose. 

Watching Bill finally bend his head and follow his order gave the young puppeteer a sense of euphoria. It was like a drug, a rush of power that came with being an enforcer, the one who made sure that everyone else was playing by the same set of rules. <em>His</em> set of rules. 

Those rules, however arbitrary, were paramount to him.

&#39;A good servant should always be ready to pick up his master&#39;s slack.&#39; Lachlan watched Bill strip out of his clothes, his eyes openly scouring every inch of his black and white skin and evaluating his body as a butcher would their livestock. 

&#39;You don&#39;t look so different from us,&#39; he remarked as the latter displayed his multitude of wounds and faded scars. &#39;With wounds like that, no wonder you call yourself inferior. A few more injuries and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you and my Skinwalkers apart.&#39;

But that was a lie, the pile of the Skinwalkers smoldering behind his back a stark reminder of the difference in strength between them and a supposedly third-rate Servant. Despite all of his shuddering and shoulder rubbing in the cold, Bill was still a Servant. If the cold could really kill, then Lachlan didn&#39;t need him anyway. The act of robbing Archie of his Servant had already completed his revenge; whatever came out of the summoning array could only be a sweet bonus.

And now he finally started to feel like reaping the benefits of said bonus.

He was back in control at last.

&quot;Ha<em>aaaa</em>allelujah.&quot; Bill sighed, lazily shaking his head side by side and letting out any traces of cold icy water trickle down his neck. His gun was safely in his hands and then slowly tucked away into his waist. He swam to the edge, heading back to his clothes and putting them back on.

&quot;Least I&#39;m still in one piece. Can&#39;t say for those weird spirits of yours.&quot; The cowboy scoffed, chuckling at Lachlan&#39;s remarks. He couldn&#39;t care less about the fourth-rate insults his Master was flinging at him. The Dowling heir would have most likely not survived the savagery of the old days.

&quot;Salvage? A corpse is well left alone.&quot; Archer was now close, just a few feet away from his Master. &quot;Besides, you seem to have money. And clothes. The two most important things. I can&#39;t think of anything else that-&quot;

Actually, he could.

&quot;Oh right. Food. But that guy didn&#39;t seem to have any.&quot; He spat out, casually, as the sound of his belly bellowed. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Poets throughout history had sought to capture that elusive beauty with words; hunters and murderers, too, have sought to find beauty in the act of taking a life. 

It was a transient moment that tickled the imagination. A moment suspended in time where anything was possible.

But a dead body that had been stripped of its vitality was ultimately worthless.

Time was of the essence. Despite the discomfort it brought him, Lachlan stripped the blades from Archie&#39;s body and plunged them into the latter&#39;s chest with surgical precision. Metal scraped against bone. He carefully began to cut through the layers of muscle and tissue, revealing the prize underneath. 

The heart.

Postmortem had not yet set in. Bill&#39;s execution had been swift, but the damage centered on the skull. The rest of the body lay undisturbed, a treasure trove of organs, bones, and sinew. Steam rose up from Archie&#39;s body as viscera was exposed to the cold air, slightly sour and smelling of metal, but Lachlan was undeterred. He moved with a fluid grace as his former schoolmate turned into fillets under his bare hands.

Roland silently assisted. After getting over the initial shock of the cracking lake, he carefully made his way to Lachlan&#39;s side, several plastic bags at the ready. There was plenty of ice to go around. He filled each bag half full of ice and held them open as Lachlan dropped pieces of organs inside.

The process was swift, almost peaceful, and harmonious. Anyone could tell at a glance that the two boys had done this plenty of times, even though the implications of the fact were dubious at best. For minutes they toiled, their focus unbroken, until—

It was Archie&#39;s mutilated skull.

Hangings, whippings, scalpings and worse. Rarely had he seen someone take the utmost care in completely dissecting a corpse and stealing away its organs. It was desecration: It was preservation. These organs were supposed to find new purpose in the future, purpose that Bill did not know. It did remind him a bit of home, somewhat.

&quot;Oh. My mistake.&quot; Bill replied, raising his hands and appearing harmless in the face of Lachlan&#39;s insults. &quot;Didn&#39;t know you were into that voodoo shit, boss. Carry on.&quot; He was about to turn around and look away, until a skull landed in his hands. Out of surprise, he dropped it.

<em>thump</em>

&quot;I&#39;ll pass, pardner. Ain&#39;t no man capable of living on bones alone.&quot; He said, scratching the back of his head with his gun as he patiently observed Lachlan continue his organ extraction.

&quot;Say, do you do this for everyone you kill? Seems fucking boring. Mindnumbingly so. Would you do it if ten or more died as well?&quot; He asked, curious, as if expecting Lachlan&#39;s future body count to reach those numbers. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Seems like you&#39;d have done well on the tanning racks back in the day.&quot; He laughed. &quot;So, what&#39;s the next step after you&#39;re done collecting?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was true. Bill&#39;s appearance was the stuff of nightmares. He&#39;d have trouble getting anywhere close to civilization without being threatened by a gun or a cross, whichever crowd he ran into first. 

Thank god for being summoned in the middle of nowhere, then. Now that they were properly out of things to kill, Bill had finally settled down, his irksome tendencies softening somewhat into a tolerable range. Lachlan returned to Archie&#39;s remains, tidying up the last bits of harvestable organs as his Servant observed his work.

But of course, the silence did not last long. The quips kept coming, as Bill seemed to be a fan of idle chatter and shared striking similarities between his conversation style and his shooting technique: both had a tendency to tumble out in a haphazard fashion, devoid of any filter or forethought.

In short, his Servant was a proper chatterbox. 

Lachlan scooped up crushed ice and coarsely wiped his hands clean. 

&#39;That&#39;s a pretty broad question you&#39;re asking there,&#39; he said after a pause, trying to keep his tone non-committal. No need to overthink it, his Servant didn&#39;t seem to be the type for subtlety. &#39;If you&#39;re asking what we&#39;ll be doing in the next few hours,&#39; he jerked his head towards the path leading out of the lake, &#39;Home. We&#39;re going back home.&#39;

A devilish thought crossed his mind, and he broke into a smile, clearly amused. &#39;You want to see some tanning racks? We&#39;ve got tanning racks at home,&#39; he said matter-of-factly, as if Bill hadn&#39;t just tried to rib him. &#39;We make our own costumes for the Skinwalkers sometimes. I can find something that&#39;ll fit you, if you want. Might be easier to pass you off as a circus clown than...whatever you&#39;re supposed to represent, right now.&#39;

The skulls and spikes definitely wasn&#39;t doing him any favors.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, March 24, 2023 8:50 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088821306776100884 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088821306776100884><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 24, 2023 8:47 AM">8:47 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan&#39;s words got Bill thinking. Thinking a lot, actually. He wasn&#39;t one to do that. He&#39;d even bet that his fingers were faster than whatever neurons lurked in his brain matter. However, this changed as a Servant. It was surprisingly hard to <em>not</em> give a shit about his surroundings when decades had passed. It was uncharted territory, yet familiar all the same. 

Of course, Lachlan brought him back to reality by delivering another cold insult at him. Bill snorted.

&quot;And I got shot at plenty. So, no wonder I shot those dolls of yours.&quot; He laughed, deflecting Lachlan&#39;s insult back at him. &quot;And I&#39;ll pass on the clown suit. Sometimes, you just have to look the part. You know how hard it was back in the day for people to realize you&#39;re an outlaw if you didn&#39;t look the part? Speeds up the process.&quot;

He stood up, kicking some leftover snow around and grinding any traces left on his spurs away. &quot;You look rich, so ya wouldn&#39;t get it. But sometimes, being trash has its privileges.&quot;

He stared at the sky, extending his arm fully and forming the universal drinking sign. Was he perhaps not only hungry, but thirsty as well?

No, he stared at his half assed shaka sign and started counting, until his hand was pointing directly to the Sun. He nodded, stroking his chin as he turned back to Lachlan.

&quot;Can we get a move on? It&#39;s three hours till midnight. I&#39;ll be damned if you&#39;re making us walk all the way home.&quot; Bill said. Maybe his Master wouldn&#39;t believe him, but Archer was incredibly against long walks. After all, it was practically suicide back in his day.

&quot;How far is <em>home,</em> anyway? Actually, <em>where</em> is home?&quot; Bill asked, tilting his head left and right. His surroundings were familiar, but the greenery was strange. The lake unknown. The cold uncommon. It was nothing like the land he had grown used to in the past.

&quot;This ain&#39;t the Indian territory, perchance?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, March 24, 2023 7:36 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Very convincing, but I think I&#39;ll pass. I&#39;ll take my chances with the silver spoon in my mouth. After all, it&#39;s not every day that one gets to enjoy the finer things in life.&#39; He gave the bags at his feet a nudge with the tip of his shoe, his tone light but pointed. &#39;But hey, if being trash works for you, who am I to judge?&#39;

Except that he judged dearly, and openly. An annoyed crease formed between his brows as Bill once again inquired about the time.

&#39;And here I thought that Servants never age.&#39; Turning to Roland, the puppeteer gestured for him to help with the bags. A single trip was all it took for them to move them out of the lake and towards the car parked on the road. 

It wasn&#39;t their car, but Archie&#39;s, though ownership no longer mattered at this point. Roland shook free the car key he had extracted from Archie&#39;s remains, while Lachlan started loading the trunk.

&#39;Be a good Servant and dispose of those trash for me,&#39; he called out to Bill, gesturing towards the expired puppets piled up on the lake. &#39;After all, you were the one who broke my toys, so it&#39;s only fair that you handle the cleanup. And if you do a satisfactory job, maybe we&#39;ll talk about compensation, as well as provide you with some actually useful information on our whereabouts.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089001431136219188 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089001431136219188><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 24, 2023 8:42 PM">8:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill whistled like a wolf at the sight of the car. He knew what it was thank to the Grail, but seeing one in the flesh was a different matter altogether. He couldn&#39;t wait till he got inside and started having a play with it-

&quot;Huh? Clean up?&quot; Bill&#39;s ears rang as he looked behind and saw the shot up puppets. &quot;Just leave them there. Nobody will care. Or do you expect me to cut them up in a stew?

The noise of gunfire masked the sound of the lake spilling out, freed from its icy prison. Heavy <em>plops</em> could be heard as corpses were tossed down, to be used as sustenance for whatever fish could survive in those temperatures come spring.

Bill walked back facing his Master and the car. &quot;Now, I think we both know I didn&#39;t do that for charity.&quot; He leaned in.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089151687488454656 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089151687488454656><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 25, 2023 6:39 AM">6:39 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Get in,&#39; he said, pulling open the passenger side door. However, it was apparent that he wasn&#39;t holding the door open for Bill. He settled into the front seat, shuddering slightly at its icy coldness.

He watched Bill through the rearview mirror, apprehensive about his reaction.

Roland couldn&#39;t blame him. Being summoned into a strange place must be disorienting, with or without contemporary knowledge granted by the Grail.

&#39;Where to?&#39; He asked Master and Servant both, hoping to distract them from the uncomfortable tension.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089179063563849799 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089179063563849799><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 25, 2023 8:28 AM">8:28 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He replied to his coldness with indifference as he took a seat inside the vehicle. His hat was being crushed under the car&#39;s roof and it was a struggle for him to fully fit in the first place. Certainly an odd sight, for a Master to be forced to sit alongside their Servant.

&quot;So, you robbed and pillaged the one who planned on summoning me? Guess you aren&#39;t so milquetoast after all.&quot; Bill joked, before hearing Roland&#39;s voice. &quot;Where you guys live at? Take us there, I imagine. But also: Y&#39;all hungry? Or is just me?&quot; He asked with his arms crossed as he raised his legs and kicked the back of Roland&#39;s seat, causing him to bump a bit.

However, a point had been made. Despite the absurdity of Bill&#39;s claim, the reality of their situation was slowly setting in. It was getting late, and neither of the boys had packed any supplied for camping in the woods. The need for sustenance was becoming a top priority now that they had secured a vehicle...

...Which also beget the question of why they needed Archie&#39;s car in the first place. The boys seemed rather unprepared for a mountain trek, apart from the heist itself. But despite this, neither of them seemed to be bothered by this particular detail, as if it was simply typical behavior for them.

Ah! The joys of youth. Or something along similar lines, perhaps.

&#39;We live up northeast,&#39; Lachlan finally broke the silence after Roland got the car on the road. &#39;Wisconsin, but it&#39;s going to be a long drive. About twelve hours, give or take.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cruel bastard.&quot; Bill laughed, before hearing the two boys talk about hours and traffic.

&quot;Fifteen hours isn&#39;t so bad. Wisconsin is quite far away after all. They got a whole different tribe living there.&quot; He muttered. The two had no ideas what tribes he was suffering to, but it was best to not trust the spotty geography of a Servant that had lived in a far older version of America.

Or was it?

&quot;Besides, you&#39;re riding a huge hunk of metal. It can take some abuse. Instead of following the main road, if you go there-&quot; Bill lunged forward, extending his arm so that he could point at the car window and show Roland directions. He was asking him to drive up what appeared to be a treacherous dirt path that went uphill and was filled with rocks.

&quot;If you drive there, it should take around 8 hours at most. Keep going forward, then follow the side path to the left. Should be easy.&quot; The two boys were confused, especially since Bill didn&#39;t seem to know where they were. Yet the Servant was giving them directions like some sort of expert. Was he merely playing dumb, or was his Spirit Origin simply reacting to the world around him, reawakening knowledge that he experienced in his travels? It had only been a century since his death, after all.

&quot;Also, gas? That&#39;s just fucking pathetic. Horses at least will eat anything they get their ugly little mouths on. Makes travelling so much easier.&quot; The cowboy shook his head. &quot;Whatever. We can find a station around the three hour mark, so just keep an eye out for the time.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, Lachlan&#39;s skeptical look was all it took for Bill&#39;s credibility to crumble.

&#39;Eight hours,&#39; he almost smiled, but the amusement was short-lived. &#39;This isn&#39;t the Autobahn, and we are not traveling on horseback. Do me a favor,&#39; he added as he pulled out a few coins, &#39;and buy a magazine on car maintenance when we stop at the gas station. It might teach you a thing or two.&#39;

With a jingle, he dropped the coins onto Bill&#39;s lap. &#39;I&#39;d almost be tempted to play along and see how many cars you can break, but alas,&#39; he added a dramatic tinge to his voice, &#39;I&#39;m too cold and tired, not to mention starving.&#39;

It seemed that amidst the Master and Servant&#39;s needless display of ego, they had both overlooked the fact that <em>he</em> was the one manning the wheel. As the driver and the one responsible for all three of their lives, he had more pressing concerns. The real issue was getting it across to his passengers.

With a weary tone he replied, &#39;While I appreciate the suggestion, <em>gentlemen</em>, I think it&#39;s best to stick to the main road. I, for one, do not want to risk damaging the car. Who knows if it has even been through its annual inspection,&#39; he pointed to the sticker on the window with last year&#39;s date.

&#39;Your lives may not matter to you, but they do to me. So please, do <em>me</em> a favor and allow me to handle the driving.&#39;

He drove on without another glance at his passengers, eager to focus on the road ahead so that he could take his mind off the stress. Gradually, the sky grew darker and the stars faded from view, replaced by the artificial illumination of electrical lights. The pinnacle of modern civilization.

Then came their salvation, in the form of a 24-hour McDonald&#39;s drive-thru.

Fast food. The crystallization of humanity&#39;s wisdom.

Swiftly, Roland took care of the ordering, reciting a list of items into the McDonald&#39;s speaker. Meanwhile, Lachlan counted out a number of small bills from a wallet he had found in the cup holder, making sure to take a few extras for tipping.

Then both boys turned around and glanced at Bill.

&#39;Anything for you?&#39;
&#39;What do you want?&#39;

They spoke simultaneously.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 1:48 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089440088729075793 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089440088729075793><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 1:45 AM">1:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The ride was brisk and calm, far from the bumpy approach that Bill had suggested. Roland suffered as Bill peppered him with needless commentary throughout the ride. 

&quot;Can&#39;t you go any faster?&quot; When the speed limit was 50.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you driving past that guy?&quot; When it was unsafe to overtake.

Truly, it was a miracle on how Bill had survived throughout his days as an outlaw. That, or Roland should blame America&#39;s bureaucratic process for making even the act of driving a car a far more complicated matter than it needed to be.

Eventually, they approached safe haven, which in modern terms equated a fast food place. Bill stared at the giant M sign in awe, wondering on what it could possibly mean. Such gargantuan buildings in the past were reserved to Gods and kings. 

&quot;That&#39;s a diner?&quot; Bill looked shocked as the two asked him about food. &quot;Hmmm, well, you got any chicken?

<em>So who is going to break it to him? That McDonald&#39;s didn&#39;t exactly specialize in fried chicken?</em>

Bill was like a newborn, seeing the world for the first time in over a century and expecting the impossible right out of the gate. For him, first impression was everything. Would the lack of fried chicken ruin his opinion on modern day eateries forever?

Eventually, Lachlan broke off the silence and turned to face Bill again, the expression on his face reminding Bill of a school teacher who was about to announce his failing test results. Not that he took any when he was a kid, but still. The young Master cleared his throat.

&#39;Chicken, fried, yes! I know you can do it, I&#39;ve had it at another location. Come on, just for me? I&#39;ll pay double. Yes? Thanks. You have a great evening.&#39;

At least, that&#39;s how Bill remembered it, in his rose-tinted glory. A food service not offering that meal was the epitome of heresy in his eyes.

&quot;Atta boy.&quot; Hearing Roland reassure him with the order made him relax a bit. The cowboy sighed, already expecting a hearty meal of chicken on his lap. &quot;Though, why are we still here? Should we not be leaving to eat our meal?&quot; He wondered. A stupid question, but one could understand: After all, Bill had never experienced the joy of a drive-thru.

He tossed a handful of napkins onto the rim of Bill&#39;s hat, followed by a plastic fork and spoon. &#39;I&#39;d rather not come out of the car feeling as greasy on the outside as the inside.&#39;

After all the utensils had been properly distributed (with another stern reminder that there would be no littering <em>in</em> the car), he reached over to grab the bag left on his side of the car, carefully going through the contents. He pulled out two hot apple pies and a McFlurry before handing them to Lachlan.

Meanwhile, Lachlan rummaged through his own bag and fished out the chicken nuggets and coffee, which he traded with Roland. The process was seamless. Both boys exchanged items from their bags in silence, already knowing the other&#39;s preferences and ensuring they each got their favorites.

&#39;Any last minute requests? All good?&#39; Roland asked Bill. &#39;We&#39;re going to hit the road right away. Next stop won&#39;t be for a while.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089937957688983642 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089937957688983642><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 27, 2023 10:44 AM">10:44 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fun, isn&#39;t it? Wish I lived to see the end of mine.&quot; It was only until Lachlan reminded him of the date that he realized just how far the world had progressed. From one century to the next. Cherokee Bill&#39;s bones were probably long gone by now, dissolved into dust particles and spread across the desert. For some reason, that fact filled him with glee.

&quot;No plates?&quot; The cowboy asked, confused as Lachlan handed him a bag with wrapper. The chicken inside smelled heavenly with a small plastic container holding the hot sauce he had requested. Everything was so compact, despite the food contents. It was a far cry from the meals he had been used to. The closest comparison was pemmican, but that sacrificed taste and flavor. Meanwhile, not only was this meal small, it had also been delivered in the span of minutes.

So, this was the power of fast food.

Bill slowly took down part of his mask, revealing a black complexion that blended in with his clothes, along with a very untidy beard. His teeth dug in.

<em>crunch</em>

The chicken tasted heavenly, far better than any form of culinary achievement back in the day. Roland could only watch in despair as crumbs and grease started dripping down the passenger seat.

&quot;MMMMMMMMMMM&quot; He exhaled, loudly, then kept crunching like a shark. The sound of teeth gnawing at bone could be heard as more particles of breaded fried chicken started to spill all over the seats. He then took it a step further and opened up the hot sauce, dipping it in chicken and tasting it. Dip and eat, dip and eat.

&quot;Boy!&quot; He shouted at Roland, almost causing them to jump. &quot;How come this hot sauce is so little, huh? Can barely fit my chicken in it! Needs to be drenched, <em>drenched</em> in it!&quot; He said while taking out another bite. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With relative indifference, he observed Bill devour his chicken with little regard for tableside manners. Roland&#39;s discomfort, however, did not escape his eyes.

But he still couldn&#39;t help but take quick peeks at the mirror from time to time, just to make sure Bill wasn&#39;t doing anything too outlandish. Those backseats were going to look extra shiny and moisturized by the time Bill finished his dinner.

Perhaps he should have asked for paper plates as well, Roland thought to himself. He took his eyes off Bill and focused on the road ahead, his ears full of the crinkling of wrapping paper and the crunching of fried batter. Holding the burger between his teeth, he reached for the radio with his free hand, blindly flipping through the channels—

<em>THUMP</em>

He almost jumped when Bill pounded the back of his seat, loudly asking for more sauce. The car swerved slightly in response, eliciting a sharp intake of breath from the puppeteer. 

<em>&#39;Don&#39;t do that!&#39;</em> Roland snapped at Bill, feeling cold sweat on his back as he scrambled to catch the burger that had fallen out of his mouth in the moment of surprise. &#39;Can we wait till we merged onto the I-80?&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 8:11 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He returned to his apple pie, which he had been munching on in an unconventional manner.

No wonder Lachlan thought Bill would be at home in a circus, since his supernatural dexterity was a sight to behold. While still devouring the chicken, he absentmindedly raised his arm up and caught the sauce packet between his ring and pinky finger. He swiftly opened it and slathered it all over the chicken, some sauce spilling out and dropping on the seats, but thankfully out of Roland&#39;s sight.

<em>crunch crunch</em>

<em><strong>&quot;MMMMMMMM&quot;</strong></em> He moaned, louder this time. There were few things that motivated him in life besides food, which some would find rather dull. How could a famed outlaw be so narrow minded in their goals?

&quot;Right back at you, boss.&quot; Bill said between slurps. &quot;I&#39;ve seen plenty of freak shows on the road, and I think you&#39;d make a killing with those puppets of yours.&quot; He grinned with bright white teeth, that were now visible thanks to his mask being partially exposed. It was shocking that they weren&#39;t stained in grease, considering how his beard looked like an unruly mess, covered in fried batter and sauces.

&quot;Now what&#39;s this shit about eighties and roads? You&#39;re telling me the car doesn&#39;t know where to go?

He turned around to find Bill lying in a bed of crumbs and sauce, and decided to mention none of it to the distressed driver. Instead, he studied Bill&#39;s face - shiny white teeth included. 

&#39;You know, you look better with the mask on,&#39; he concluded frankly. &#39;The &quot;puppets&quot; we ship out are more lavishly dressed and much more appealing to the eyes.

It was tedious more than anything, and now that they were rid of the baggage and back in a speedy car, he was infinitely more glad.

But Bill didn&#39;t seem to be very impressed, and Roland was even less impressed with his drab comparison to a horse.

&#39;A horse also can&#39;t run at 75 miles per hour for a whole night,&#39; he countered, trying to make a point.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090425583437094952 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090425583437094952><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 7:01 PM">7:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;75 miles?!&quot; He spat out another bone. &quot;Fuck me! Why didn&#39;t you say so earlier? Can&#39;t even feel that we&#39;re going so fast!&quot; The cowboy shouted, which made Roland question Archer&#39;s intelligence. Had he really been so comfortable inside the car that he couldn&#39;t even perceive the vehicle&#39;s speed? Or was he just messing with him?

&quot;Oh, so you sell your dolls? Well, whaddaya know. Didn&#39;t think there would be a market for freaks.&quot; Bill puckered his lips, eating the last pieces of chicken and wiping the grease off on his coat, as if it were a rag. Disgusting. He then covered up his face with his mask, returning to the formless black blob from earlier.

&quot;They don&#39;t die easy, I&#39;ll give em-&quot;

&quot;-that. Saw a bullet hit their skull and they still kept moving. Didn&#39;t think your freaky voodoo was capable of that.&quot; He said, his words sounding more like genuine surprise than an attempt at praise. &quot;Good thing that don&#39;t work on Servants.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m beat. That was the best meal I&#39;ve had in ages. I mean that with all of my heart.&quot; He said while crossing his fingers. He then leaned back, placed his feet on the top of Roland&#39;s seat and stared at the ceiling. His hat covered his head.

&quot;Zzzzzz...&quot;

Frankly, to call Bill a &#39;bit&#39; different was a gross understatement. Between the bizarre driving &#39;instructions&#39; he had tried to impose upon them and his musings on the &#39;metal horses&#39; of the 20th century, Bill came across as a hayseed experience civilization for the first time. But he was also far from harmless: while an ignorant man posed little threat to society, an ignorant man with <em>power</em> could do so much more.

Roland silently prayed that they would make it back home in one piece, at the very least. He glanced at the road sign coming up ahead and made some mental calculations.

&#39;At least fried chicken seems to sate him for the time being,&#39; he concluded.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What did he mean that it <em>&#39;made sense&#39;</em> that he was British?

&#39;I&#39;d be more concerned if he <em>couldn&#39;t</em> pop off a few heads in a heartbeat,&#39; he shoved his legs up on the dashboard, irritation creeping into his voice. &#39;As long as he can pull the trigger when I say &quot;shoot&quot;, he&#39;s free to do whatever he pleases. The Command Seals will keep him in place, anyway. And to be honest, I don&#39;t see what your fuss is all about, especially since he came out of Archie&#39;s catalyst. I can&#39;t imagine the guy summoning anything that <em>I</em> can&#39;t handle.&#39;

Indeed, as Bill fell into a slumber, Lachlan couldn&#39;t help but liken him to an overzealous hound, running around and expending all their energy before conking out after a meal. It was amusing to think that despite being composed of spiritrons and fueled by mana, Bill still retained some of his human traits.

And humans were far, far easier to manipulate than animals.

The puppeteer settled into silence as the car continued down the highway, occasionally passing other vehicles with their bleak headlights. Roland had finally found a radio station after fiddling with it for a while, and the music drowned out the rhythmic snoring coming from the back of the car. Lachlan leaned back in his seat, closed his eyes, and started nursing the throbbing headache induced by his fragmented mind.

It wasn&#39;t everyday that someone could sever his mental connection to several dozen puppets all at once.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1090445407898832967 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1090445407898832967><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 28, 2023 8:20 PM">8:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
