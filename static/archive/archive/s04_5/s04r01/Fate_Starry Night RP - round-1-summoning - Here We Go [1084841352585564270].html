The city was certainly a strange change of pace for the Magus, the bustling of the city in major contrast to the near isolation of his own home.

<em>7:05</em>

He stood within the shade that the hotel had provided, his hand affixed inside of his pocket. It certainly looked better on the brouchere, but he was aware enough of the rumors that came with it. The outside of the hotel was coated in a gaudy yellow, though through the various cracks on the outside you could see bits of the previous layers underneath and bits of mold seemed to surround the corners of the hotel, a small gift from the Nile.

As he reached towards the door, it seemed to open by itself, to the shock of the Magus who quickly withdrew his hand. Wilt would lean forward, poking his head through the automatic doors, being greeted by the whir of a fan and a wave of humid heat. The AC was still damaged by the power outage, and to save the money of actually fixing it, the receptionist seemed to just line up a fan in the lobby. 

The inside of the hotel was similarly undesirable, the bright carpet sticky and sandy all over and bugs seeming to be crawling just out of sight. Truth be told, Wilt wasn&#39;t all too bothered with the conditions, simply checking his watch before making his way over towards the receptionist, who seemed busy with a round of solitaire on his computer.

<em>7:12</em>

The receptionist slowly looked up from his game, having just now noticed the man who had simply been staring at him for the last few minutes in complete silence.

&quot;Oh, uh, I didn&#39;t see you there.I-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here for a room.&quot;

&quot;Alrig-&quot;

Wilt would pull out a wad of cash and places it on the desk before leaving, not waiting for a response from the man. The man kind of just sat there in silence as his head popped out from beneath the counter with some keys before going back to his card game.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084841772141785280 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084841772141785280><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 9:13 AM">9:13 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Wilt made his way up the stairs with a sort of focused stride, he was on a slight time limit-wanting to summon the servant on the peak of his mana production. The hotel was a bit below his standards, hardly being tight for money his entire life and pretty far from the docks but it was a nessecary evil, in his eyes. His mystic code made hiding in plain sight impossible-and attempting to establish a workshop for himself would be a fruitless task.

He assumed most mages wouldn&#39;t go rummaging through the worse parts of the city, the hotel itself having a reputation for hosting a murder-though the details of it had long since been forgotten perhaps a lovers quarrel , and with this many people inside of it it&#39;d be hard to deal with him discreetly. 

As Wilt made it to the top floor he absent mindedly reached for the door knob without thinking and turned once, and then again as though making sure. Not realizing his own mistake, he simply reinforced his arm and with a quick strike knocked the cheap lock free. He was for sure gonna have some complaints for the hotel.

As he steps over chunks of the wooden frame, closing the door behind him, he gives another glance down to his pocket watch.

<em>7:17</em>

The room was small, the only light coming in from the window at the other end of the room. He kind of gave a analysis of the room, the intricacies of the tacky painting and the strange stains on the bed, before casually taking the painting on the wall and tossing it over his shoulder. It was hardly a good canvas, the wooden walls of the hotel, for his ritual but it&#39;d have to do.

Wilt would close his eyes for a moment, imagining the circuits within his body. It took him much longer when it came to projection magecraft, and he certainly didn’t want to burn too much of his own mana before the ritual-it already wasn’t untold of for soon to be Masters to pass out after the ritual. A second image would come to mind, in quick succession.

Wilt’s hand would wrap theirselves ar</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084841774004064367 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084841774004064367><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 9:13 AM">9:13 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>n wire, pulling it straight and taut. Blood slowly seeped from his palm as his grip tightened. He opened his eyes again as the image faded from his mind.

His circuits would switch on, an unpleasant feeling as though holding his breath in spreading across his body. Had he not taken in  his families crest, or what he could manage at least, prior to this trip, he certainly wouldn’t have had enough for the summoning afterwards. A knife constructed itself within his palm, though he gazed upon it with a slight look of disappointment, its stony gleam in contrast to the image he materialized. He flipped the knife in his hand, weighing it slightly, aiming the edge of it at the wall.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084841841628815441 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084841841628815441><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 9:14 AM">9:14 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The knife chipped through cheap paint and walls, forming the outer circle of the ritual. It was a fairly simple task for the young magus, akin to a muscle memory at this point.

A sort of dread seemed to come over Wilt, something which he had chosen not to focus on prior. Summoning a proper knight class servant would be a poor outcome, hardly having the mana to fulfill their needs. A berserker would be a similarly bad outcome, he’d probably die before he even managed to wake up, be it from the berserker or the mana spent on the servant. A caster would be best, certainly, them being able to handle their own mana and maybe he could even learn a thing or two from them. 

The circle was finished with relative ease, and the knife in his hand disappeared back into the aether, deconstructing itself now that the job was done. He pulled out his pocket watch another time to check the time, laying his hand against the circle. He had some time to kill between now and the summoning, but without even so much as a word from Wilt, the summoning circle began to spark and glow with magical energy, recognizing the hotel itself as a catalyst for summoning.

Wilt’s whole body seemed to tremble with the sudden drain upon his mana supply. He stumbled back a bit, using the bed to keep himself up as he watched the circle ebb and flow with energies.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Infamy. <strong>Hotel.*</strong> 

In just moments, the circle that Wilt had carved into the wall of his hotel room - having identified the specified catalyst - began to glow with a bright light unlike any other. It was a lucky thing that the mage had braced himself on the bed just prior, or the powerful blast of air that accompanied the sudden magical surge would have blown more than just chips of paint off of the surface they were on. 

With one final, blinding flash… everything went still once more. It would take a moment for the drained mage to get his bearings, but there now sat within the room a handful of things that would easily catch his eye.

Though the wall the circle was carved upon now looked as though it had been torn apart by a tornado (not unlike the door to the room), there stood in front of it a much more perturbing presence. 

Standing just about the same height as Wilt, there was now a man covered head to toe in… head to toe… in… 

At the very least, Wilt could tell that the man was wearing clothes very unfashionable for this era. While an argument could be made for having a trench coat over a suit and tie, the bowler hat was most certainly a thing of ages past. 

Despite the height similarity and layers of clothing, it was easy to tell that the man was barrel-chested and broad-shouldered, if not well-built and brawny altogether. 

But that’s not what made the man so startling, apart from his abrupt intrusion. It was his face. Rather, it was the expression he wore. The look on the man’s face was completely neutral - lips flat, eyes sunken, no movement of any facial muscles, no twitch of his large, well-groomed mustache. So neutral that it looked as if he may have been nothing more than a soulless corpse. To make it even worse, he was staring right. at. Wilt.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084953799325655041 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084953799325655041><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 4:39 PM">4:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His eyes were… were… It was impossible to tell.

“Good day to you, sir.” 

Enough information about him to be gained from this short sentence. His voice is husky, but his tone - at least, at the moment - is rather polite. That being said, his words seem to lack any emotion, perfectly matching his current expression. 

He takes a short pause to take in the room, moving not but his eyes as he looks around, keeping his hands-grasped-behind-the-back stance as he does so. His eyes would quickly move to Wilt, starting at his feet, and ending at his eyes. Just like that, he went back to staring. At this point, Wilt would begin to question if the man had blinked even once this entire time.

“My apologies for the immense conspicuity of this observation, but it would appear that you are the one who called me back to this plane. As a servant, nonetheless. If this is true… might I have your name?”

Another brief pause. Not long enough for Wilt to respond, however.

“Before you answer, I wish to tell you one thing, knowing the likely outcome of my inquiry. <em><strong>Assassin</strong></em>.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite a spectacle such as this usually able to enthrall him, he was hardly in a state to admire the showcase in magecraft. He was frankly shocked that the spell seemed to activate on itself, perhaps he had miscalculated-or perhaps it was foul play? The Djinn&#39;s presence seemed to coil itself around the magus&#39; hemmoraging magical circuits as it&#39;s voice ran through his still dazed head.

<em>&quot;This much mana so quickly? Certainly you&#39;d appreciate some assistance. It already seems like you&#39;re about to keel over.&quot;</em>

Wilt simply ignored the voice, knowing well enough what it was trying to do, raising his head towards the monochrome figure. He was immediately hit with a strange feeling of unease, perhaps it was just all the mana he burnt in an attempt to give form to his summon-or perhaps there was something about his almost corpse like appearence. <em>Did I mess up the ritual?</em>, they <em>were</em> supposed to be ghost like from the descriptions he heard of, but they were hardly described as close to dead as this one stood in front of him-as though he tore a dead body from the ground itself and gave it life....it hardly fit the idea of an hero of old either. His form nebulous in Wilt&#39;s eyes, he had half the mind he was still being formed as they spoke, or maybe it was just a trick of the light. The heat would get to one out here.

Wilt seemed to eye down the spirit for a few good moments, as though trying to verify if he really was a servant, before straightening himself against the bed frame. If the man had intended to hurt him, he figured, he would have already done so. There was a tinge of dissapointment when he heard he was an assasin, but nothing seemed to surface above his usual pokerface.

&quot;Wilt.&quot; He made his way over towards the busted door, leaning against it for a moment, before locking it or at least attempting to with what was left of it. He had done a number on it with what little time he had. It was a good thing he bought it, or so he thought at least. &quot;You don&#39;t strike me as much of an assasin.&quot; The man certainly wasn&#39;t a Hassan, to say the least, the iconic skull mask nowhere to be seen, unless he had hidden it in that bowler cap of his and hardly seemed like much of a fighter, even with his wide frame.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He did nod when the mage returned his greeting, at least.

Once he heard that Wilt was indeed his master, the strange servant seemed to have a bit more life to him. Upon seeing the command seals wielded by this “Wilt”, the man would finally move both his arms and his eyelids, shutting his eyes while getting in a good upwards stretch with a short grunt. Nonetheless, he would go right back to the position he was first in.

…Not an assassin, huh? An interesting observation to make before ever asking for his name. That could be an advantage of sorts… but not when it comes to his master. They need to be a perfect partner, and what sort of perfect partner doesn’t even know his name? It would make planning much too difficult, something that would serve only to weaken their chances at winning.

The man would take one of his arms and place it across his chest and ball the other hand while keeping it behind his back, then bow slightly forward, tilting his head up so that the rim of his hat isn’t blocking the view of his master’s face.

“Pleased to meet you, Master Wilt. I may not be an assassin in the archetypal sense, but trust me when I say that the shadows are where I belong.”

With that, the man would slowly straighten his stance before whipping around, causing his coat to fan out for a moment, before taking a few steps towards the disfigured wall, placing one hand gingerly upon it. Without bothering to look at Wilt this time, he would speak once more.

“The shadow of a place like this, to be precise.” The man would turn his head to the side and take one step outwards, now facing not Wilt, but the bed Wilt had held himself against. The white sheets now blown partially off of it were horribly stained. The kind of stains that would soak so deeply into the fabric that even the most copious amounts of bleach couldn’t make them disappear.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 11:40 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085057278220181544 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085057278220181544><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 11:30 PM">11:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>After a brief observation, the man would speak once more. “It would seem that my appearance here was due not to the nature of my master, but due to the nature of the environment in which I was summoned.

Now done with his observation of the room, the man would turn fully back around, then take a handful of steps towards Wilt.

“To make my words easier to believe, allow me to give you my name. Herman Webster Mudgett, at your service. Or rather-”

Unbeknownst to his master, this assassin’s Presence Concealment had come into effect the moment he came into this world. Now Wilt was about to give a glimpse of what happens when one is able to see through the guise of “Herman Webster Mudgett”.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That would be the least of Wilt’s worries, however.

That same split second, Wilt’s inability to tell what exactly the man looked like would fade, his true form coming into plain view. From clothing, to skin, to hair, the man had suddenly become <em>monochrome</em>, every part of him in view now some shade of gray. His eyes, however, simply gave up their coloration entirely, now appearing entirely white. If he looked corpse-like before, he most certainly looked like a specter now.

The most horrifying aspect of this form, however, was the thick, imposing aura of dread and bloodlust that seemed to seep from the man. If it were visible, one would imagine that it would appear as a jet black miasma. What Wilt had felt before was but a fraction of this aura. Taking it to the face must be an entirely different sensation… one that would bring most people to their knees in pure terror.

There was simply something off about him, something Wilt wasn&#39;t accustomed to yet something very palpably uncanny even before his reveal.

He listened intently to the servant, especially as it revealed in part what the servant was summoned by. The idea of a catalyst was not foreign to the newly crowned Master, but the <em>hotel</em> itself being one certainly was shocking and it only heightened his curiosity when it came to the identity of his servant.

And then the servant seemed to rip off the mask which was hiding it&#39;s true visage. If Wilt was not a magus, he certainly would have coward before the murderous aura of the murderer. It was as though he summoned someone who had never been human at all. The aura manifested itself as a sort of weight across his body, as though his body itself was scared to move in front of the assassin. His face itself didn&#39;t seem to fully register the sort of animosity he was being subjected to, his usual poker face just staring blindly into ebony miasma.

The smell hit him secondly, the chemicals only confirming his suspicions further. He hadn&#39;t summoned some assassin in history, but rather a murderer from the modern day. He wasn&#39;t opposed to such an outcome, despite the menacing figure in front of him, his own situation hardly let him complain about a servant like this. 

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure.&quot; He&#39;d move himself off of the door frame with a bit of effort, taking a few steps towards his servant. They were shaky, but his destination was clear. He certainly <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be afraid of his own familiar, so he wouldn&#39;t be. Forcing his body towards the corpse like figure, he put out a hand towards him, looking for a handshake from the banshee esque man. &quot;I look forward to your cooperation, Doctor.&quot; Wilt straightened himself up slightly, ignoring both the oppressive aura and his own expurgation of mana.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For HH, one’s ability to withstand this horrible presence of his meant everything. No good partner in crime is so afraid of their other half that even being around them was an issue - and that was something he was keenly aware of. There would’ve been no need to approach his new master, otherwise. 

To the serial killer’s surprise, Wilt seemed rather… calm. Any normal person would’ve shown at least some amount of apprehension or distress, but the mage’s expression remained stone-like, much like his own. It was something he’d have to look into. Could he have been wrong in thinking that the hotel was the only reason he was summoned here? 

But the test wasn’t over. Many people fancied themselves stoics, and humans were willful creatures. HH knew that well. <em>Too</em> well. People such as detectives and prison guards forced themselves into the vicinity of known killers all the time. But to freely interact with them, no cuffs, no chains, no bindings… apart from those three seals laid upon the mage’s hand, which did little to bother HH, and likely did just as little to bring the mage confidence… that was the real test. He’d given his name. Unless Wilt was a complete moron, there was no way he wouldn’t be able to gather who HH was, even if he didn’t know him by name. Now, they’d have to become “friends”. Acquainted, at least. Not all business requires such intricate knowledge of one another, but it would be a necessity this time around. A strategy with any level of complexity would require that he know <em>exactly</em> what Wilt can do, and that Wilt know <em>exactly</em> what he can do.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085448187491401828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085448187491401828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 1:23 AM">1:23 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And would you look at that? HH watched as Wilt summoned the willpower to move closer, taking step after step - even if they were slightly stuttered and shaky - towards him. It was a bit too early to truly tell, but HH had already begun to feel as if he were going to be happy with this arrangement. Happy enough to not slaughter his summoner here and now, that is.

Albeit taking a moment, HH would eventually be offered a hand by the young mage. 

<em>It’s a pleasure.</em> A pleasure, was it? Seemed like something he himself would say. It was a bit too obvious that Wilt’s words lacked sincerity, or much of anything, really… something he’d have to work on. That, or they’d have to leave the talking to the serial killer, who was generally a good enough conversationalist to the point that he could easily coerse the gullible and the greedy into either joining him on his schemes, <em>or into becoming one of his victims</em>.

“The pleasure is <em>all</em> mine.”

HH would take one of his hands from behind his back and grasp the hand offered by Wilt with it, making sure the strength he imputed into his grasp met his gentlemanly standards, but wasn’t enough that he’d cause his master any pain. That being said, Wilt would find that HH’s hand was rather dry, callused, and rough, making the experience that much more uncomfortable.

“My cooperation you shall have, Master Wilt.”

With those words, the ritual was finally over. Wilt was now a master. The master of one of the 19th century’s most infamous serial killers. To finalize the handshake, a single pumping motion was all that was needed. In a similar fashion to the initial grasping on hands, HH would input enough strength to meet his standards, but not so much strength that it would bring harm to Wilt. He was careful like that, especially when it came to those useful to him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He himself would notice his own form weakening, allowing him to understand the predicament his master was in, even if he was unaware of the details surrounding it. 

With that in mind, the serial killer would close his eyes for a moment, focusing intensely enough that it could be ever so slightly seen on his face. In but a few moments, he would go back to that strange, unobservable form he had taken during his initial appearance, making it so that Wilt wouldn’t have to suffer from his true form’s presence for one second longer. He was satisfied with the results of this test, even if he had to cut it short. They’d speak of that little issue later, unless his master had the gall to bring it up.

Handshake over and done, HH would release his grasp, quickly bringing the hand used for the greeting behind his back to meet with the other.

“Before we get down to business, there is something I must ask. Would this quaint abode of yours happen to have accessible coffee grounds and the necessary implements for brewing? I find myself rather parched, and believe that you would stand to benefit from a cup, yourself.”

While he had gained no extra life to him, the serial killer had suddenly switched from inquisitive intimidation to friendly accommodation. Hospitality, even that as fake as the self-titled doctor’s, requires having many faces and the ability to quickly switch between them. This was such an example.

Though the last sentence he spoke wasn’t necessarily a quip, HH wanted to get the message across that he could tell what kind of state Wilt was in. He could feel it himself, after all, given his own lack of mana reserves forcing him to heavily rely on the mage’s. He was taking a gamble offering him coffee, but anything that could give Wilt some amount of energy back was worth a try, even if it wasn’t necessarily the type of energy needed in this situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A murderer at his beck and call for now at least, was not the worst outcome though his dependency on his mana left Wilt in a precarious situation. 

He nodded slightly to the servant&#39;s affirmation, he didn&#39;t truly expect the servant to go against him-revealing it&#39;s true name and not killing him seemed to make it clear that they were partners, for now of course. It wasn&#39;t unheard of for assasins to kill their masters, especially towards the start of the war, but he had passed whatever sort of appraisal H.H had decided to put him through. Much to his own relief.

He could tell well enough what the servant had insinuated with the coffee comment, his eyes linger over the disguise which he had thrown over his truer form and he certainly didn&#39;t overlook the change in demanor that came with it. Coffee certainly <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> help him but...who was he to turn down a good cup of it.

He gave another glance towards Assasin, he <em>certainly</em> would fit in...to an extent, sorta, and there <em>was</em> a coffee machine in the lobby. He placed his hand on the door knob, making his way back over towards the door and peaked his head outside. He looked to the right side, clear, and then to the left, clear, before looking back at his Assasin. &quot;I suppose it wouldn&#39;t hurt to get a cup of it. Black?&quot; He looked him up and down as he said the last bit, fairly assuming the man wouldn&#39;t enjoy a light coffee, with his appareal as the foremost indication.

The lobby held <em>a</em> coffee machine, though it left something to be desired from Wilt, not that he was going to complain anything was better than a day without it. The receptionist had better things to do than to question Wilt and the strangely dressed man, his game of minesweeper being far more enthralling than questioning those two. Wilt had been using the walls to help himself in his descent, but managed to rest his palms across the table of the table and slowly began making himself a coffee with a sort of mechanical precision to each of his movements.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was always glad to have partners that prioritized safety… unless it meant acting against him, of course. 

Fortunately, Wilt seemed to take little insult to his insinuation, and was willing to take him up on his offer. Not that he thought his master would do anything about it, but HH measured risk in just about everything he did. Every step was a risk, and he wasn’t one to take a step without there being a potential reward for doing so.

In this case, the potential reward was more than just a cup of coffee.

The serial killer would take a deep, long breath before sighing. He never enjoyed parting with his things, but he was just as aware that bowler hats were no longer a staple of gentlemanly fashion. With that thought in mind, he would reach up and take it off, slowly and carefully so as not to mess up the hair underneath. Doing so in the matter of seconds, he would let it drop. The hat would lightly glow as it fell and begin to flake into a million pieces, dematerializing fully before ever touching the ground. Keeping one hand behind his back, HH would take his other and brush his hair back, making sure there were no tufts of hair raised from taking off his hat. 

“That should be better. Such a thing is considered rather gaudy in this era, no?”

In any case, Wilt’s assumption was astute. While HH wasn’t unable to stomach milk, sugar, and other additives, he was a man who enjoyed coffee black and unadulterated. In fact, it was one of the few things he enjoyed that shared the latter description. 

“Black, indeed. If you don’t mind, I wish to have a little conversation with you before having myself a cup. Feel free to get one yourself, of course.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086125014979444787 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086125014979444787><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 10:13 PM">10:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>That was all HH had to add to the conversation before making his way out of the room to follow Wilt, who had gestured for HH to follow him. While he was rather stiff when it was just him and Wilt, the serial killer seemed much more <em>alive</em> now that he was in an open, public space, making it appear as if his master were the one that was dead - or, in this case, <em>dying</em>, seeing as his master was sparing himself from supporting his body’s full weight as he walked. This issue of Wilt’s was worse than it initially seemed, wasn’t it? Even if he were worried about it, the only indication he was giving was the occasional long glare at the mage.

Wilt was the last thing HH was interested in looking at, however. Instead, he seemed to inspect every aspect of the hotel within his reach every opportunity he got. The wallpaper, the floor, the lighting, the furniture, the walls, everything and anything that could be told by a light touch or quick visual examination. Because he valued looking as normal - or, in his case, “gentlemanly” - as possible, the serial killer kept a watchful eye about their surroundings.

He made sure to keep up with Wilt during these examinations of the hotel, but made sure to keep some distance from him as well. Not so far that he couldn’t move to intercept an attack, but not so close as to make it so obvious that they were a pair. He preferred to move as if they were strangers, and, as such, he decided to pull out a chair at a table near to his master - who’d began using a much more modern machine than the serial killer was used to in order to make and pour himself a cup of their shared beverage of choice - before taking a seat at a nearby table, where he’d be close enough to speak to his master without the need to turn to him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086125066909126707 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086125066909126707><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, March 16, 2023 10:13 PM">10:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He’d wait for his master to finish and turn around before jestering with a quick nod of his head towards the readied chair.

“Yes, hello? Ah, good to hear from you, too. Allow me to inquire about something. How much do you know about the hotel I’m staying at? I’m rather worried about the security, and I was wondering if you’d be able to tell me anything about locks, cameras, et cetera.

Either way, Wilt was quite pleased with the result, not having to step on Assasins feet so early on.

There was a degree of safety that came with traveling with his servant, even if he was a bit unsettling at first had he not been stumbling through the halls he might have enjoyed it more. 

The magus had <em>some</em> experience with such a device, being one of the few electronics he had managed to smuggle into his more traditional magus household. He returned with his cup, taking a seat relatively close to his Servant. He kind of just blankly stared at him for a few seconds as he began to talk to himself, not picking up on H.H&#39;s meaning immediately and then the importance of it. 

&quot;Ah.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086409621251563690 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086409621251563690><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 5:03 PM">5:03 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His vision returned to his cup of coffee, swirling it around absent mindedly as the white cream began to spiral and mix within the murky waters. H.H was seeing how defensible this place was, or so Wilt believed. Wilt reached into his pocket and retrieved a small flip phone, spending a moment almost inspecting it as he slowly opened it. He had bought one for the novelty of it, not thinking it&#39;d get much use at all. He brought it up to his ear, starting his own faux conversation. &quot;Ahhh, hello?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. This place is a real dump, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyway out besides the entrance and the stairwell. A fire hazard, maybe.&quot; Wilt was not subtle and was exceptionally monotone in his delivery, but the receptionist didn&#39;t seem to pay too much heed to the weirdos in the lobby. He kind of just gave a glance down towards his hand, having broken down his own door prior. &quot;The place is practically falling apart, the frames are crumbling.&quot; He&#39;d take a sip from his cup of coffee, recoiling a bit at the heat. He knew about the cameras, vaguely, having taken notice of them while he climbed the hotel-but electronics were not his strong suit. &quot;No, no. I wouldn&#39;t know anything about that. I haven&#39;t even left the hotel yet.&quot;

The young man kept the cup in his hand, sipping at it gingerly as it slowly cooled down. It was hardly of the pristine quality that he was accustomed to, but sitting down helped the strain of the mana consumption somewhat. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have any visitors, yet. It&#39;s far too early. I doubt they&#39;re even prepared for the trip yet.&quot; While he doubted that the other masters were here, he understood the risk of giving up his location well enough. &quot;We could move, if necessary.&quot; It was not ideal, being caught in the city before he even had a sense of the location.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Wilt had caught on to what HH was doing, but not what he was <em>thinking</em>. Hiding intention was something he was great at, but he cared little to do so when it came to his partners, or, in this case, partner. The information was good, at the very least. Good <em>for what he was planning</em>.

“Hmm… I see. No need to worry about other clientele, I’ve heard this place is rather infamous, no? Let me go ahead and see if I can find any signs of a recent break-in, just for safe measure.” 

At that point, HH would stand up, then walk over to the entrance door, inspecting it as he approached, keeping his hand up to his ear as if he were still listening. It appeared that the only way to lock it was by the use of a key. And he knew just how to get it.

Wilt would then watch as the man walked calmly over to the lazy receptionist, still too bothered to look up from his game even as HH approached him. Once the suited man reached the desk, he would seemingly stretch once more, arms out to the side and slightly behind him, before returning to a normal stance. 

“Might I have your attention, sir?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One swift motion was all that was needed. In the blink of an eye, the serial killer had sunk a large, serrated, rusty blade through the neck of the man behind the desk. It was a perfect strike, the blade stuck precisely into the side of the neck at the level of the Adam&#39;s apple. The man’s common carotid arteries, internal jugular veins, and windpipe had all been severed at once.

Before he was able to mentally react to what had just happened to him, the receptionist would be forced to cough, splattering blood all over everything in front of him - the monitor he had been staring at all this time in particular, all-too-real sanguine crimson now covering what was once a harmless digital game of solitaire. 

In what was only other motion at the moment, the serial killer would pull his blade from the man’s neck, causing a gushing spray of blood to erupt from both the entry and exit wounds. In excruciating pain and fated to bleed to death in a matter of a couple minutes, the man would only have the time to glance up before fainting face-first into his own bloody spittle.

With that one glance, the man had become aware of his predicament. The <em>thing</em> that had walked up to him was no man. It was a vengeful spirit of some kind, or worse. No, <em>most definitely</em> worse. It was a <strong>monster</strong>.

Wordlessly, HH would let go of the knife, allowing it to slide back into his sleeve. In that same motion he would appear to grasp something that had yet to form. The shine of magical energy would give way to something that was so comically grotesque and terrifying that it seemed to come straight out of a horror movie: A giant, rusted bonesaw, after the summoning of which HH would leap over both the receptionist and his desk, momentarily disappearing from view.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086437125337133098 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086437125337133098><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 6:53 PM">6:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>HH had given Wilt no time to react.

He’d walked over, stabbed… them (?) with a knife, and let… them… bleed out before leaping over the counter. But that’s where the issues began. There was no blood to be seen. Even though he was sitting, he was sure he had a good view of the body… but there wasn’t one in view.

“I believe this is the item we are in need of, Master Wilt. My apologies for the inexorable crassness of my actions. I feel there is no need to tell you, but that goes for my future actions as well.”

With that, he’d head towards the front door once again. With a single twist of the wrist, he was going to lock everybody in there <em>with him</em>.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His gaze kind of just rested on his servant, curious as to what his plan was. 

And then he lunged over the counter.

Wilt watched the receptionist, the man he had just talked to the-memories of the figure seemed to completely unravel before the young magus. There <em>was</em> a murder, Wilt could tell that much, but it was as though a veil had been placed over his eyes. He slowly got up, making his way over towards the counter, peering over as though he&#39;d see what was left of them. 

Wilt hadn&#39;t really expressed much at the murder of the man, aside from the deep curiosity towards the circumstances of it. He looked up towards H.H with similar curiosity, perhaps <em>now</em> wasn&#39;t the time-but he&#39;d certainly have to ask more about his servant&#39;s abilities. Something about his calmness and almost mechanical order of operations made Wilt look past the seemingly wanton murder, there was certainly a reason for it, not that he valued the life of the stranger to begin with. 

The minute was met with a silence from his master as well, beyond the quiet whirring of the fan as it valiantly fought against the quiet room. Wilt simply stared at the place where the victim was-as though formulating the exact details of his death inside of his mind. It was strange how quickly the details of the person seemed to fade away- even the words he had spoken moments prior were reduced to nothing more than a acknowledgement that they were there.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086707161347936406 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086707161347936406><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 12:46 PM">12:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As the Assasin locked the door, Wilt had more than realized his intentions looking upwards towards the other rooms.

Wilt turned his vision back towards H.H, taking another sip from the paper cup. &quot;You&#39;ll have plenty of work to do.&quot; Wilt took no offense with his actions, clearly, instead there was almost a vague intrigue that came with his words. What would come with the deaths of these people? He knew one thing for certain, this was the recreation of his Servant&#39;s myth, his Noble Phantasm, the mark he had left on the world.

&quot;What do you plan to wish for, Assasin?&quot; It was a simple enough question, even if it was a strange time to ask it. Despite the Doctor gauging Wilt as a master, Wilt himself truly didn&#39;t know much about H.H-not that one had to become so intimately knoweldgable about a familiar, but it would be good to appeal to the servant&#39;s needs when it came to it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

HH was prepared to make his way upstairs to meet the rest of his quarry in a similar fashion to his first victim in this life, but his master deigned to speak with him before he could wander off. An act that would serve to delight the serial killer. 

From what HH could tell, Wilt was unshaken. In fact, it would seem that his master took some intrigue in his actions, something HH could gather from the young mage’s voice alone.

“Depends on how many lost souls dared to stake their lives coming to such a horrid place. But work it is. Necessary work that must be done. I would love to tell you as to why that is, but it is a conversation that need be had once I am done. They may be locked in, but humans are intelligent creatures, even the lackluster ones. I am left with no choice but to state that time is of the essence.”

HH would continue on his path towards the stairway (to hell)… until Wilt dared to ask the serial killer the question that all masters and servants were doomed to be curious of. 

He would stop in his tracks, standing completely still for a moment before turning to his master. The expression of his face was unchanged from what he originally met his master with, but one look into his eyes would be all Wilt would need to tel that his emotional state had changed.

The serial killer no longer looked half-dead. Instead, his eyes burned with dreadful intensity. 

Then came the smile. Without the need for words, Wilt would learn exactly why HH never cared to change expressions.

The man’s lips would part inhumanly far from one another, both vertically and horizontally, making it appear as if his his face had been torn apart. His teeth and gums were completely in view, and appeared relatively normal, were it not for the lack of cover. And then, he would speak, voice brimming with an excitement that had not been heard until then.

<strong>”I wish to no longer exist!”</strong>

Just as quickly as that unearthly expression appeared, it would fade.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086783147741560913 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086783147741560913><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 18, 2023 5:48 PM">5:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>In a much less mechanical motion, HH would toss the key he’d taken off the receptionist to Wilt.

&quot;Do be safe.&quot; And he&#39;d simply wave him off, the keys jingling as he does

Though he didn&#39;t understand the precise reason that he&#39;d wish for such a deranged thing, that frankly didn&#39;t matter to Wilt. The passion for such a thing would drive his servant further than Wilt probably could ever- without spending one of his command seals at the very least.

Wilt slowly made his way over towards one of the chairs, situating himself in it, sipping at his coffee passively. He wasn&#39;t too nervous about a opposing master showing up, not yet at least, and frankly trusted the murderer he had summoned to handle the other residents without too much of a problem. Even if he was low on mana, a servant should certainly not struggle with the people situated in the rooms up above.

The young magus placed the keys on the small coffee table, opening up a brochure with vague interest, though it was simply filled with various tourist traps that were made certainly just to squeeze every penny they could out of the foreigners which came here. Who wanted to see Egypt&#39;s biggest ball of yarn anyways? He took occasional glances at the stairwell and the entrance-but he was sure they&#39;d make presence more than known. Propping his feet on the table he made himself comfortable, it wasn&#39;t like there was going to be anyone to tell him off about it and he figured he was going to be here for a while. This place had plenty of people situated in it, and with H.H&#39;s tactful nature it was unlikely he was going to wake the others with his parading through the halls.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
