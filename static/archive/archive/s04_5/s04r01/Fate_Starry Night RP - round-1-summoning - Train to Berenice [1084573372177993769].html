He was in a new country and the airport security had played a number on him, due to the fatigue the forgotten catalyst had even more left his mind as he continued through airport security in search of his guide. His father had order a local friend of his to show the young boy around the city and to make sure he arrives on time to take the train that leaves for Aswan. From there he would meet with another of his father&#39;s acquaintances who would take him to the apartment he would be staying while in Berenice.
Setting foot into Egypt the extreme whether change amazed him as he look at the bright blue sky and burning sun. It was a complete change of scenery from the snow filled estate in the Alps to the summerlike whether of Egypt. He was glad he had packed clothes to match the change in climate and quickly entered in one of the airport&#39;s bathrooms to change.
Coming out of the bathroom, the young boy was wearing a black shirt buttoned only half way and some black trousers. The heat again hit his face as he decided to leave the airport. His father&#39;s friend was not difficult to spot as he was caring a giant sign that read &quot;Welcome to Egypt Karl!&quot;. Karl was overrun by joy as he looked around the busy and crowded streets of Cairo. He wanted to see the pyramids so badly, but he was dragged into a black cab and off he went to the train station.
Carrying his briefcase tightly he thought about his mother looking at the traffic and overall chaos surrounding him. The scene was similar to what he experienced in his stay at the von Ro&#223;mann estate. He sighed looking visibly tired and laying his head on the man&#39;s shoulder. The man was kind enough to let him take a nap and before Karl knew it he was carefully being shaken.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was amazing to say the least, but Karl had no time to admire the beauty of it. He was quickly dragged to the ticket office and was handed a single large blue and white ticket with some weird scriptures. He had no time to think as yet again he was being dragged through a crowd of people and surprisingly cattle, cutting through the line and hearing shouting come from all lines. His father&#39;s friend finally had taken him in front of the train&#39;s entrance. He was still in shock, moments before he was sleeping in a cab and now he was surrounded by thousands of people trying to enter a train. He blinked in confusion, feeling a sharp pain on his hands and looking down to see his briefcase handle. During this whole &quot;trip&quot; he had been holding it for dear life and in the process hurt his hands. But, he could not let go of it just yet. Karl was instructed to stay in the train&#39;s cabin at all times and not leave. &quot;You will be informed by one of the train conductors when you arrive in Berenice&quot;, - said the man and left abruptly.
Karl entered the train and looked for cabins. He tried to cut through the crowded line to reach what he thought were the cabins, but when he arrived found out were the bathrooms. Not knowing what to do, he asked one of the train conductors about directions, to his surprise they responded and showed him the way. Karl was glad he was finally able to let go of his suitcase. Looking around he found himself in a tiny and crowded little room, a bed stood next to him and a desk in front of him, he quickly threw his briefcase on the desk and himself on the bad. Taking a good look at his palms they had turned a bright red colour and some blisters had formed on them, turning his right hand around, he found there engraved a red symbol, it had appeared approximately two months ago and had taken the shape of the head of some sort of hound. He sighed and closed his eyes wanting to regain some of his lost energy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084588154264227990 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084588154264227990><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 4:26 PM">4:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He was only woken up when the train made an abrupt stop in another station. Having regained most of his energy, Karl did some stretching and decided to take a look at the catalyst his father had given him. He opened his suitcase and did not find it anywhere. Breaking in sweat he finally understood the feeling he had this entire time, he had forgotten his catalyst at home. Checking his pockets he picked his Nokia phone and noticed the amount of missed calls he had and laughed. Yet again his rush had caused another problem. Now he did not know what to do, how was he gonna summon his servant?
He found the book that was given to him by his father discussing the Holy Grail War and skimmed through it finding the section concerning the summoning of a servant. There he sighed in relief and let himself relax on the bed yet again, he had now realised that it was not as comfortable as he had thought, but the most important part is that he now knew that he could summon a servant without the need of catalyst. The catch was he did not know who was going to answer his call.
He might as well give it a try. Summoning a servant was a process that required immense amount of concentration from the Master, thus Karl slapped himself once and was ready to proceed. The reason why he did not want to wait until Berenice to perform the summon was that there he would probably be asked about the catalyst and be helped through the procedure by one of his father&#39;s friends. He did not want to appear as a fool in front of them, even though quite realistically they would be aware of the current situation.
He made a small magic circle with a piece of chalk he found under the bed, it was probably left there by a child who had used the cabin since it had a bright pink colour. He made sure to draw it carefully and looked at the example on the book quite often, after a few minutes he was ready. He took a deep breath and began to chant while holding the old rustic book on his left hand:</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084588436561854485 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084588436561854485><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 4:27 PM">4:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Let silver and steel be the essence.

There was little difference to their height, but in appearance they made contrast. The fair haired figure in front of him looked at the boy and stated his sentence with such glory and beauty that Karl was left amazed.
The gust of wind had not only closed his book, but caused a set of goosebumps to run down his spine as the bedside lamp stopped flickering and he slowly began recovering from the numbness. He gulped, amazed at the figure he was able to summon. He had a million questions to ask it. But, he had to be quick. Maybe it did not like clumsy masters or maybe it was some sort of snob. Karl was uncertain, but the crimson colour meant one thing, it was definitely someone strong and well-known in history.
The room was already small and crowded therefore, the Heroic Spirit and his master were only 2 m apart from one another, thus they could feel each others breaths and Afonso could see the utter joy in Karl&#39;s face.
A wide grin had formed in his face as his emerald green eyes shined under the brim light, the train had began to move and dusk had fell. As soon as it entered a tunnel of sorts, Karl asked:

&quot;I...I am Karl von Ro&#223;mann! A pleasure to meet you! I hope we will make a good pair and work together to win this Holy Grail War! Ummm...&quot;

A short pause, Karl was thinking. His thoughts were getting all clustered up by joy as he stood there and blurted out a bunch of question.

&quot;What might be your name Mr? Class? Origin? You look like a knight, I love knight, is that the sheat of sword? Can I see it, please Mr! You don&#39;t need to call me Master, if you want! You can just call me Karl! Do you want to wear something more comfortable, it seems we have the same height, my clothes my fight you!...&quot;

His questions continued, but the more they went on the less sense they made. He had began to blush in the presence of Afonso and his grin was turned into a soft and childish smile. Everything about him had become childish.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had been waiting in anticipation to hear about the person he had just summoned. Thus, when Afonso began to introduce himself, Karl&#39;s eyes sparked with joy as he heard every word Afonso said carefully, making sure he did not miss anything. He began to breath slower, so that the sound of his breathing would not disrupt the dialogue he was having. He listened as the King made not only himself, but his class known to the young boy as well.
<em>King D. Afonso Henriques</em> Those words echoed in his mind as he jumped in joy, hitting his head on the ceiling of the cabin and causing the room to slightly shake. He placed his head on his head, touching the small bruise this collision had caused and laughing. He was truly a child in a grown-up body. This eccentric behaviour might have scared Afonso at first, but he will probably get used to it as time passes. 
He continued listening not daring to speak and ruin the angelic voice of the King in front of him. He noticed that Afonso did not wish to answer the question regarding his blade, but Karl&#39;s eyes remained fixated on it, there was something just mesmerising about it. But, he did not dare to make any further questions. From what he had assumed, the sword probably had great importance to the figure in front of him. Maybe it even was related to his abilities? To cut things short, Karl had no longer an interest on it and removed his gaze from it focusing it on Afonso instead.
He had heard about King Afonso in the past, while he was studying World History in Middle School, if he remembered correctly, but his knowledge regarding the figure was limited. He just knew that he was the first King to established the Kingdom of Portugal and played an important role in the Iberian Reconquista.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085186857698066492 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085186857698066492><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 8:05 AM">8:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His thoughts were cut short as Afonso yet again began to speak and the silence, coming from Karl, overtook the room. He heard the king explain the reasons he did not wish to change his clothes and Karl nodded. He did not want to push his servant to do anything, in fact he wanted to create a friendly bond with it. Just like good old friends. Thus he answered:

&quot;Whatever you wish Afonso! I want us to be friends, therefore don&#39;t be shy to state anything you might dislike about my behaviour! I want to be great friends by the end of this conflict!&quot;

Karl was an optimistic. He knew that amongst the participants he had the least chance of winning due to his inability to kill others, but yet he did not give up on his dream of winning the Holy Grail War. And the topic of the conversation shifted to it, the reason of his participation. He had never thought quite of it, he just wanted to make his family happy. With the death of Otto, who was supposed to partake in the conflict, they had lost hope. But, Karl stepped in and decided to put a smile on everyone&#39;s face. He knew he would not make the best master, but he still would fight for what he believed in and protect his principles and his family&#39;s name. As well as to show to his father once and for all that he was a capable Magus in his own right away, these were the motifs that lead him to take part in the war. All these thoughts ran through Karl&#39;s head and he did not want to go overboard with details, the question was short, but Karl&#39;s answer was not:</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085186966632534148 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085186966632534148><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 8:05 AM">8:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Most people we are going to encounter Afonso, will probably have strong motifs to win the Grail. While I myself, took part in it just to show everyone that I am capable of being a great Magus one day. You see, I am unable to kill other beings, just the thought of it makes me sick...this lead to me being ridiculed by my family. I wanted to take part in this war to show them that everyone can be a great Magus in their own way! I want to make my family proud and see them smile. I wanted to show the world what I, Karl von Ro&#223;mann am capable of performing even with, what they called, my &quot;disability&quot;. I know to you Afonso, it might seem like a silly dream, but I hope you will help me to achieve it...&quot;

He looked at the figure above him with a gentle and childish smile, a rosy blush having overtaken his cheeks and asked it:

&quot;Sorry, if you might not want to answer this question, but what do you wish from the Grail, Afonso?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>There was, however, something became alarmingly clear as time passed on: Karl was still green when it came to these affairs. Treating him not only with the respect that historical figure of his caliber deserves but as well as if Afonso was a living person that he wished to befriend. Not only that but... being unable to kill someone in a war while IN a war wouldn&#39;t end very well for both of them.

<em>A slight frown was visible in the servant&#39;s face, before giving a nod to his master. The most rewarding path was most often the harshest. Karl had plenty to learn, but he was a good kid. Perhaps too good in fact.</em>

It was what everyone thought of when he declared to his family his participation. The frown in Afonso&#39;s face made the boy bite his lower lip and think. Should he ask him or not? The question lingered in his head as he looked outside of the cabin&#39;s window seeing that a long night awaited them.
He let go of his lip and sat on the small bed, Afonso now on his right. He looked at him, his eyes showed emotion, just this time it was not that of joy but uncertainty. He took a deep breath and asked Saber:

&quot;Afonso, do you think I&#39;m capable of doing anything in this war? I am certain you will find some king to fight, people tend to summon them in these conflicts. While for myself, I don&#39;t know if I will be able to achieve my desire...&quot;

As he said those words he laid back on the bed staring at the ceiling. The question directed towards Afonso was more serious this time, showing that Karl was a capable adult if he wished to do. He anxiously awaited the Saber&#39;s response as he looked at the light above him. He wondered how long until they arrived to Aswan? He was getting tired and wanted to sleep, he looked at Afonso and continued:

&quot;I am exhausted, I think I will take a nap or something. You should rest too, tomorrow will be a big day. We will finally get to see the island of Berenice...I cannot wait!&quot;

He exclaimed with a childish voice, it was like a completely different person stood in front of Afonso, as the boy turned and closed his eyes. His coat on him, his book still in his hand. The boy had drifted into sleep and left Afonso alone with his thoughts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Keep your faith on me as your servant and in yourself as a master. If I managed to make a nation that still exists over 800 years later, then why shouldn&#39;t you be able to achieve that who you desire?!&quot;

Who else would risk their life just to be able to make their family accept him for who he is? It wasn&#39;t something useful in battle, but it was something that aided them more than the resting boy could anticipate.
