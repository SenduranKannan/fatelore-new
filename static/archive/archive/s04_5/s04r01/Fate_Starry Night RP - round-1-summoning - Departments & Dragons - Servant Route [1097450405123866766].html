<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“So small. Elusive.”</code>

It was to be expected that the blind flailing of claws would miss their mark, but for Triboulet to have already retreated back into the shadows cast by the winding aisles was proof of her nimble prowess. Though she played off her efforts with showy bravado, it only served to cause her opponents to underestimate her, to forget that underneath her never-ending stream of sarcasm and ridicule, she was still a Servant.

Lindwyrm realized that it wouldn’t be able to follow her in time, and in its frustration, reared its head back, collecting energy for a brief second, before unleashing its glacial roar towards its scurrying meal. The unforgiving howl of winter blanketed the storefronts in formidable partitions of clearest ice, the intention being to catch Triboulet and stop her from moving, though it would appear that Lindwyrm simply ended up erecting a barrier between itself and her, giving her even more opportunity to hide should she have managed to evade the encroaching growth icicles.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“...”</code>

Lindwyrm wriggled itself free from the hole it had burrowed and stalked towards the ice, eying it curiously and hoping it could spot Triboulet behind it. However, as it began to restlessly claw at it, a thought occurred to it, one which seemed to have eluded it until now.
Just moments prior it had been driven by Ann’s command, but now she was nowhere to be seen, her memory already starting to fade from the beast’s mind.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“You are a woman,”</code> it spoke, the chaotic rage it had channeled to chase after Triboulet now noticeably lessened, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“A bride, perhaps?”</code>

Clearly this dragon seemed to have a few screws loose itself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was plain that she was merely a distraction - and a damn fine one at that! - but she had to at least take a shot at the thing, didn&#39;t she?  Or, at least, give it a reason to really hate her!  Can&#39;t let the old man have all the merriment.  The beast spoke, so clearly it had some capacity for reason.  No mere beast of sin this was, no - but would it hold a capacity for <em>humor?</em>  That&#39;s what she could only hope.

With the danger of Berserker looming about these darkened halls, and supernatural cold biting at her hands, she struggled to maintain peak form in the most important of areas, improvisation.  Her mind was awash with the fear-tinged excitement she felt, and this was a tougher crowd to play to than any she had seen before.  Focus, think, observe...

She passed by a row of washing machines, head low and back hunched to keep her head beneath the price signs.  Something to do with washing?  Washing, cleaning, filthy beast, get over here and try to wash the scent of death from your ass?  Obvious, and more importantly, no way to play up the gag besides pointing to the machine and hoping he gets it.  

Then, the frozen corpses of children, watching a colorful video game that now sat unplayed.  Simple joys, death.  Playing, watching...come on, let&#39;s settle this over a less lethal combat?  You know you won&#39;t win, perhaps you&#39;ll have a chance here - and look, these kids have been hogging it long enough!  Macabre, she could work with that.  Too on the nose?  It wasn&#39;t as if he&#39;d accept, but if he did, there&#39;s no way the dragon&#39;s giant mitts could wrap themselves &#39;bout that ungainly trident-looking device those frost-covered hands are attached to.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097593126333464668 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097593126333464668><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 17, 2023 1:43 PM">1:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was far from a perfect solution, more just a layer of protection, but she found it shortly afterward - spotting just out of the corner of her eye, a flash of red playing from a monitor as she ran past.  It was a camera, hooked up to a demonstration television, serving perfectly despite the immense cold.  A salesman was still pointing at it to passerby, ironically selling it to Triboulet for the price of nothing past his own death.  She reached for it - and at that moment Lindwyrm&#39;s roar shook everything about her, and as she reached to cover her ears, she almost sent the camera off its tripod.  If she hadn&#39;t dived for it at the last moment, it would&#39;ve caused a domino effect of frozen bodies and shelves...

...appropriately comedic, but a bit too revealing to let happen.

It was only a little bit after that, and after Lindwyrm made his untoward offer, that said TV came back to life with Assassin&#39;s face looking down through it. The camera was placed on a man&#39;s foot, anchored to the ground by ice and severed from its body by a crashing television shattering most of the former human.  It served as a good prop to angle it up, even if it was a bit morbid.

&quot;A bride?&quot; she said, her voice amplified and misdirected through the television&#39;s speakers - she was only a few aisles over, and if Lindwyrm was attentive, he&#39;d notice the cable running from television to who-knows-where among the tangle of others - &quot;Me?  You&#39;d choose the dainty, frail, hunchbacked afterbirth of a woman?&quot;

She could hear the approaching wall of inhospitable cold crackling towards her...just needed to get the joke out...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Having dived out of the way to elude Lindwyrm’s attack, the propped-up camera now pointed at her at quite an unflattering angle, her features filling the entire screen border-to-border, though fortunately this only served to more effectively capture her opponent’s attention. The cable giving away her position went unnoticed, though to begin with, Lindwyrm wouldn’t have been able to make sense of the technological intricacies of the device anyway.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Thine manner of birth is of no consequence. King and Queens have birthed greater malformations, their royal blood diluted and spread thin. It is a bride I seek, not a princess, no matter how fair or foul she may be.”</code>

Its entire body now facing the television, Lindwyrm had ceased its efforts to tear down the ice standing between it and Triboulet’s position, expecting an answer first before resuming its rampage. Its strange obsession left it oblivious to anything but its immediate surroundings, though if the accumulating claw marks beneath it were any indication, it was unlikely that the beast would patiently sit still forever.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Look at her, and how she squatted down by the camera, her kind features now all the more visible.  &quot;Your kindness is like the reprieve of spring, but the brilliance of your white scales only brings to mind winter...no, it brings to mind your magnanimity and sharp wit!&quot;  Her smile was beautiful once removed from her vicious mockery, and her rosy pink cheeks and nose (mostly so because of the sheer cold around her) were as cute as a button.  With a snap, she transformed that little scepter she held into a beautiful bridal bouquet of red and white roses.  &quot;If you would have me...&quot;

Assassin leaned forward, her eyes closing with a flutter and her mouth coming dangerously close to the camera&#39;s lens - magnified to be almost as big as Berserker&#39;s snout by the television.  Lindwyrm&#39;s willingness to look past her flaws, and even set apart the violent wishes of its Master, it made her swoon!  Could this be...<em>true love&#39;s first kiss?!</em>

&quot;Ah.  I think I realize the truth here.&quot;  The camera&#39;s view jostled as she picked it up by its handle, and she looked into Lindwyrm&#39;s eyes across the connection.  

&quot;You&#39;ve got the brilliance to keep me to love and cherish like a fine...and that common street whore you call a Master, you&#39;re going to split her apart with your <em>prima noctis!&quot;</em>  The camera jostled violently as she turned it about, snickering to herself.

He&#39;d be not much of a dragon if that did any harm, but Assassin, she jumped right after the thrown camera to try and take a slash at his eyes with a knife - whether or not it did anything, she was risking quite a lot to get this close to the dragon.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Stringing Lindwyrm along for as long as she did, the beast’s gaze was firmly fixed on the shifting image of the television screen with nary a thought spent on its opponent’s classification as an Assassin Class Servant. The camera broke against its hide like waves upon rocky shore, leaving nary a mark nor even eliciting the slightest reaction from its intended target. The knife however, was a different story.

Though Lindwyrm’s scales were highly resistant to all manner of physical trauma, as one would expect from a phantasmal beast belonging to the species of dragon, even if a lesser one, its eyes were not. While not quite as vulnerable as that of a human’s, the membrane considerably tougher to grant it protection against the biting winds incurred during flight, at the end of the day they remained a vulnerability that was impossible to compensate for.
The knife’s edge connected, it’s blade cutting deep, and in stark contrast to Lindwyrm’s icy breath and frost-dyed scales, the blood which sprayed from the gash was boiling hot, or at the very least hot enough to feel so after Triboulet had to labor in the mall’s refrigerated conditions for as long as she did.

The beast roared, letting its pain carry far and wide.

Lindwyrm’s body shook in rage, but with its one eye blinded, it was unable to discern exactly where its assailant had gone. No matter. The general location would do.
Angling its wings before itself, pressed flatly against the ground not too dissimilar from a snow-plough, it blindly charged forward until it met with a wall, disregarding whether or not it had actually managed to catch its assailant or not. Once unable to go any further, its legs curled and pressed against the groaning floor, pushing itself off with enough force to slam its entire body into the ceiling above, blowing open yet another hole to behold the night sky, before inevitably, its body came crashing down once more in a chaotic downpour of fractured debris, all manner of shattered fragments of glass and metal embedding themselves into the ground around it.

Having neglected to consider its landing due to the lingering sensation of pain, Lindwyrm ended up as a careless pile of its own limbs and tail, thus requiring it to wriggle itself to its feet before it could resume its feral hunt.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 12:50 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Apparently Assassin found her crude humor funny enough that she couldn&#39;t fully stifle her laughter, even after sinking a knife into the soft material of its eye.  Crude, but effective!  Never once doubt the power of calling people&#39;s wives shitty, no matter what land or time you reside in.

She stood within its now very literal blind-spot, and then tried to jump to avoid its wide sweep of the area - which would be easy, were it not for her getting hoist&#39;d by her own petard.  It was a very brief window to notice what went on, but a glance downward gave her a guess as to why she was stuck to the ground.  Lindwyrm&#39;s unnatural wave of cold from prior had caught up to them and frozen the very fluid of the dragon&#39;s eye in a flash, binding her foot to the floor!

Assassin had time to do many things, but what she elected to do was quietly say &quot;Oh, <em>merde,&quot;</em> before taking the dragon&#39;s wing to the face.

Dragged along the ground all the way to the wall, crashing through rows of shelves and equipment as she went, she ended her ride pressed headfirst into one of the oversized televisions in the back, the sort of CRT monitor that required an entire team to move.  Just this was enough to put her in bad sorts already, her frail constitution not being anywhere near that of a warrior, and she was left gasping for air before the dragon lifted off and away from her.

Wracked with pain, Assassin was fully incapacitated for a precious few seconds.  Glass embedded into her skin, her suit was torn and dark red mixed with garish yellow, and she could barely move herself out of sheer disorientation.  She pulled herself from the television just in time to see the dragon crash down with a spray of detritus, and she tried to stand...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098331740797407334 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098331740797407334><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 2:38 PM">2:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...only for the wave of ice, again, to have caught up with her.

Recovered from its helpless tumble, Lindwyrm spotted Triboulet not too far off. Easily reachable. Her body immobile for some reason or another which it did not care about.
Quite literally seeing red due to the deep gash gouged into one of its eyes, it wasted no time shifting its hind legs backwards, its lower body stretching and raising into the air as it lifted its tail, only to unleash it as a massive whip to split the opponent before it in two. The sheer weight behind its mass caused the frosted air to whistle as it made its approach, until-

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"> &quot;Look, my future g-g-g-groom&quot;
</div></div>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“!?”</code>

-at the last second it pulled its tail up, Triboulet merely receiving of its sharp breeze as it collided with the massive CRT monitor behind her, immediately shattering it beyond repair.
But why? Why did it suddenly halt its attack?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“You…”</code>

It made no effort to disguise its displeasure and reluctance as it gradually snuck closer to this most troublesome of women, the rhythmic tapping of its fully extended claws playing a crackling melody as they punctured the shattering ice beneath its feet. Closer and closer they came, until finally they came to a gentle rest on Triboulet’s stiff legs, its head shifting to regard her with its one remaining eye.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“...if you profess me to be your groom, then prove it.”</code>

The air around it shifted, its following words almost appearing as if not its own. Much like a chant, yet lacking thaumaturgical purpose. A ritual with no significance. A script born from its legend that it was forced to act out to affirm its own myth.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Fair maiden, shed a shift!”</code>

The damnable skink was only within a stone&#39;s throw, spitting distance, arm&#39;s reach--then, its claws were wrapped about her leg.  Her dagger was mid-strike, with a bit left to go before she could pull herself out.  Once again, with her right hand stuck between the meat of his forelimb, she got to see just how large these claws really were.  Look, you could probably sharpen the end and call it a shortsword, curved like that of the Mohammadeans.  Jesus, they&#39;re big.

She looked up at Lindwyrm, still smiling, and nodding her head when he spoke.  Here, the beast&#39;s scales were individual and myriad, the hate in its eye was clear, and its breath was unbearable.  Still, she kept the guise of a model wife (savaged and badly bruised, naturally), up until that request was made of her.

Triboulet looked up at it with eyes as wide as saucers, completely still.  She blinked twice.

...and then she reached up with her free hand, and...took her hat off, setting it to the ground gently with a clatter of debris.  Lindwyrm was provided the spicy sight of the top of her head.

&quot;&#39;tis enough?  Or...&quot; she said, phrased as a genuine, cautious question and not the sarcastic slight it probably was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her ‘shedding’ wasn’t quite what it had expected, as it wasn’t exactly common to consider one’s hat as a layer of their clothing, but neither was Triboulet wrong. Or at least not exactly.
That technicality would have to do however, even if it took Lindwyrm several long seconds to deliberate as well, its body still and unmoving with the sole exception of its labored breaths, its pupils shifting between the discarded hat and its <s>unwilling</s> bride-to-be.

Then. Eventually.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“It is.”</code>

The beast&#39;s reply came, and with it, the end of its charade.

Night had fallen. It had found its bride, and she in turn had complied with its demands and shed her shift. The ceremony was now complete, with but one final act remaining to complete it.
Lindwyrm’s maw opened wide, revealing rows upon rows of teeth sharp enough to tear flesh from bone. A faint glow shone from deep within its throat. Perhaps its kin’s Dragon’s Breath lying dormant in its chest, or perhaps a glimpse at the Magic Core which acted as its beating heart. Regardless, Triboulet was now close enough to feel the conflicting swirl of its breath, one in which organic warmth contended with phantasmal chill, the beast’s jaw slowly seeking to swallow her whole.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No, she had seconds before this marriage of theirs was consummated, played out and annuled in one bite!  Her leg violently strained against the ice binding her as she tried to ignore the pain that shot through it, and she offered a feeble attempt at convincing him otherwise.

&quot;C-Come now,&quot; she shrugged, &quot;th-that&#39;s all?  N-n-not-t-t even the quickest glance &#39;pon this girl&#39;s form?  Frigid old man.  Y-You could let me stand up - this whole th-thing&#39;s one suit, then n-no-nothing&#39;s left out to show...&quot;

She waited.

The dragon&#39;s maw was almost around her, any second, he&#39;d snap his jaws shut and just bisect her.

Then, with the moment exactly as it should be - and her arm able to reach as deep as she could - it was done in almost an instant.

A flash of steel in an arc, and suddenly, the dragon&#39;s tongue was wholly removed from its root.  Not that it&#39;d do anything to shut the thing up, most likely.  Already damaged from her earlier chipping, her knife left a jagged wound behind that was sure to prove a terrible pain, and she even dropped her knife inside its mouth.  That&#39;s because, moving as fast as she could, she finally broke free...and took the tongue with her!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098831830779699270 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098831830779699270><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 11:45 PM">11:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The moment the dragon&#39;s vision cleared from the terrible flash of red, the haze from the agony of having his softest flesh pulled out from him, it&#39;d see that very impudent bride once more.

Her entire front side was stained with a foul mixture of both draconic and human, only her brilliant blue eyes showing past the dark red that covered her face...and in her right hand was Lindwyrm&#39;s entire tongue, which she held up with a maliciously mocking grin.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?  Shy?  <strong>Cat got your tongue?</strong>&quot;  She taunted him by wiggling the mass of muscle.

If you&#39;re aught but terrified to provide a kiss, you blushing virgin, <em>let me do the honors.&quot;</em>  And then, despite inner revulsion, she gave the severed tongue a quick peck.  Alien saliva mixed with bodily humors and the almost gelatinous form, making it all the more disgusting, but <em>comedy,</em> her twisted form of comedy, prevailed.  She didn&#39;t even blink!  Then, she tossed the tongue back, and ran as fast as her pain would let her with intent to leave this department.  The chase resumed!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The wounded beast recoiled in trembling agony, its body instinctively stumbling back a few paces from the shock of having its own tongue ripped out and granting its assailant a few moments of reprieve. The brilliant white scales around its mouth were stained in deep crimson as a torrent of blood gushed out from between its tightly packed fangs, its lost ichor dripping onto the broken floor and seeping into its numerous cracks. The fact that Triboulet’s knife was left in its maw was irrelevant compared to the blinding pain of its cleft tongue, the little rationality left to Lindwyrm now drowned out by scorching rage.

Lifting its blood-soaked head, it unleashed a gurgling roar, almost choking on the amount of blood that had built up in its own mouth, the sound of its fury considerably muted because of it.

Magical energy surged in its chest, a tell-tale sign of its accumulating breath, before Lindwyrm spat out its blood in packed bursts of crystalline balls of frozen blood, the force at which they traveled akin to a storm of hail the size of cannonballs. Already Triboulet had made her retreat of course, and so the rampaging beast followed, lacking no amount of blood seeping from its wound. Pausing once only to devour its own tongue tossed at it, swallowing its own flesh whole without hesitation, it soon resumed the chase, leaving a trail of vermillion ice in its wake as it continued to clear the accumulation of its own blood by mixing it into its draconic breath.

The layout of the mall favored Triboulet, the tight corners and passageways only slowing her over-sized pursuer, but for every wall and barrier that was in its way, Lindwyrm would simply claw and gnaw its way through them. Twice its prey had drawn blood from it. It would not allow it to do so thrice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dark red bolts of frozen blood flew past her head like grapeshot, one zipping close enough to whip her hair in its wake, but she didn&#39;t care.  Comedy had prevailed, and the only downside to all of this, minus the blunt force trauma, was the fact that it was going to be difficult to top that exchange.

Just imagine the look on James&#39; face when he hears all of this, of how well she&#39;s bruised the ego of her...

...well, actually, he&#39;d probably just call it disgusting, wouldn&#39;t he?  Good lord, and think about what he&#39;d ponder when seeing her soaked in gore like this.

Whatever.  It&#39;s not his night to enjoy.  The only thing he&#39;d care about was killing the damned Servant, and though she made far more progress than expected, she doubted her ability to finish the job.

Maybe if it was dumb enough to fall for the bridal jest a second...no, no, let&#39;s not test our luck that badly.

From electronics to a much stranger place, at least to her sensibilities.  She had wheeled out the front door and took a right, gaining less lead than before through the slight hobble in her leg.  A trail of bloody footprints was left wherever she went, let alone the scent, so stealth was going to be difficult, and this colored her decision: not the gardening store, she wouldn&#39;t have the time to set the plants on fire.  Not the bridal boutique, as much as the irony would kill.

No, Triboulet ran into...Chatty Rat&#39;s Pizza Fun Zone.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099193903690813474 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099193903690813474><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 21, 2023 11:44 PM">11:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>An ersatz copy of a more familiar place she wasn&#39;t at all familiar with, something about its neon zig-zag carpets, bright lights that shown even in the shambles the mall was in...it spoke to her.

She had just enough lead time to leave behind a warm welcome to Lindwyrm.  At the front door was a whiteboard on a stand, and in blood she had scrawled,

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">TODAY&#39;S GUESTS IN THE FUN ZONE:

It found itself in a place of dining, a space which, while frozen in time and preserved in a single innocuous instant, displayed a number of families and their children enjoying their meals without a care in the world. Food. Nourishment. Had it known of this place earlier it could have already been in the middle of performing its ceremony with Ann, her hunger sated and thus satisfying the last of her complaints.

A rumbling boom rocked the room as Lindwyrm neglected to stop in time, its head carelessly colliding with it head-on, its body coming to an abrupt halt.

Yanking its neck free from where it had buried itself into the rocky cliff-face, it turned its gaze upwards, and like a snake coiling itself around its prey, slithered its way along the vertical surface, using its sharp claws to pull itself ever closer towards its prey.

Yet it appeared it couldn’t even wait that long.

Its jaws opened wide, the blood spilling down its cheeks, a bright ephemeral light welling up from deep within its chest as it prepared to spit another frozen icicle, not realizing how dangerously close it came to choking due to the near vertical angle of its neck.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It buckled, she could feel whatever metal structure lay underneath wanting to give way to the unexpected force, but she remained upright.

No thanks to the theatrics on her part, though.  She wobbled on one leg and exaggeratedly twirled her arms around for balance, calling out &quot;Not so rough, <em>mon amour!</em>  You&#39;ll wake the neighbors with this sort of racket!&quot;

It seemed that, despite every opportunity to do so, she did <em>not</em> intend to flee from this one.

That. Or perhaps it was simply good luck and fortune, impossible coincidences which kept the joking jester alive and merry.

Finally the structure could take no more as the base could no longer bear the weight, the fake cliff-side caving inward and folding over, Lindwyrm’s own body the anchor that dragged it downwards to the ground. No. Not again. It would not allow Triboulet to escape again!
With a final leap it sought to close the distance between them, but already its tail had gotten stuck in the vice created between the floor and tumbling rock, holding it in place. Its limbs too lacked strength. The accumulated fatigue of its reckless use of its draconic breath finally made a dent on its unnaturally high magical resources it was summoned with, not to mention the constant and rapid loss of blood it neglected to do anything about. It was a single moment of weakness, one which did not necessarily imply its proximity to death, but one which was nevertheless a consequence of its wild offensive, and a direct result of Triboulet’s efforts.

A moment of reprieve.

It was enough for Triboulet to catch her breath, but soon enough, the ground shook once more. Ripples tore across the surface of the ice, forming numerous cracks along its side, before with a thunderous screech, Lindwyrm burst out from underneath, flailing and wailing like a babe.

With one of its wings it struck the air, catching a number of frozen shards before it and launching them at its prey as a hail of malformed shrapnel.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She did nothing more than hold out her arms and seemingly wait for death, even closing her eyes as the dragon leapt upward, but the final result of her patience/insanity was an escape.  Lindwyrm was thrown to the ground, the dragon laid low beneath the weight of mankind&#39;s approximation of nature, and she leapt from the structure at the last moment.  The tipping gave her a bit of momentum to give her an even easier escape, and she threw herself from the top to land with grace.

Assassin did not land with grace.  She managed to land directly into the thin plastic roof of a claw machine, shattering its delicate parts and ending up in a heap of torn plush, mechanical parts and broken glass.  Not much that could wound her body, of course, but why not a classier resolution?

&quot;Let this worm be spent of zeal already,&quot; she pleaded to none but perhaps God, &quot;it&#39;s just a shame that I ended up with the unthinking brute...&quot;

She spent her reprieve pulling herself free of the broken thing, only standing up and pulling the severed head of an off-brand blue rodent from her cloak when Lindwyrm once again proved it was still alive.  His storm of ice came afterward, and Triboulet moved to avoid it - many flew past in a blur, one caught and tore a hole straight through her cloak, and one more landed a glancing blow on her bad leg, exacerbating its issues further.  She yelped in an undignified manner, but grit her teeth and bore it, though walked with a more noticeable affect.

&quot;Don&#39;t give up!&quot;  She held both hands over her mouth to try and shout over the dragon&#39;s violent flapping.  &quot;What will your friends think of you when they heard you couldn&#39;t even last ten minutes?!  Show some...oh wait, you have no friends!&quot;  Triboulet&#39;s next move was to try and take advantage of Lindwyrm&#39;s apparent weakness, and go for one more strike, as dangerous as it was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100513007248887929 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100513007248887929><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 25, 2023 3:05 PM">3:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She lept forward, and in a moment, tried to gauge the dragon&#39;s body - seeking out anything that looked softer than its armor-like scales, something she could pierce.

Or perhaps that too was her own personal brand of recklessness.

In its day even the most venerated of courtly knights shrank beneath its gaze, turning back to flee behind rampart walls rather than draw their swords to strike the beast down. Yet here was a woman, draped in the garish colors of a lowly jester, who had dared to accomplish what trained knights had lacked the courage to even attempt, and for that she deserved recognition.
If only her opponent had not been a mindless beast.
If only she had not been human, and it a dragon.

Her knife connected with the leathery skin spanning between its wings… and did nothing.

Though its hide was noticeably thinner there, it yet remained its hide, and thus enjoyed the formidable protection awarded to the rest of its scales. Her blade slipped helplessly against the taut flesh, causing a slight indentation, but otherwise leaving no wound nor scar, its wing utterly unharmed by her attack.

Lindwyrm had been taken by surprise with Triboulet’s unexpected charge, prepared to continue its chase rather than making ready for an attack, and was therefore slow to react to her throwing herself at its wing. Not that it had any qualms about its prey delivering themselves to it on their own volition.
Slamming its opposite foreleg into Triboulet’s body mid-fall, it violently pinned her body against the floor, the impact so savage that the knife in her hand, which had made its way down to the clawed joint of its other wing, deeply lodged itself in the gap between keratin in flesh, a metallic wedge which sunk into the root of its razor-sharp talon and scraped beneath its impenetrable hide, a bladed splinter which once more visited a new dose of agony upon the maddened beast.

Seeking release, it wasted no time to direct its rage at the victim pinned underneath its grip.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The action thus far had taken the entire business all up in its calamity - tokens freed from frozen coin dispensers jingled to the floor with each flail, pinball machines wailed with sirens for an unexpected tilt, and tests of strength weren&#39;t sure what to do with being shaken to the side and therefore sounded the victory bell all the same.

This was much like what happened when Assassin had been taken and so savagely beaten - the entire floor shook with the impact, sending a new wave of clamoring noise through the frozen arcade, as if in mocking applause for her error.  Her shock had completely overriden her bravado the moment she saw that leg in the corner of her eye, and now, pinned to the floor, she had let panic take over entirely.

This only became worse as Lindwyrm gripped her tightly, and sent her into the floor once more.  A complete fray of thought overtook her, nothing distinct forming above the panic and the shock.  Her attempts to pull its club-like toes from her torso did nothing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100828775400341615 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100828775400341615><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 26, 2023 12:00 PM">12:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Lindwyrm slammed her into the carpet a second time.  She grew disoriented, taking a good share of the force to the face, but not enough to avoid noticing the dagger-like sharp pain of her nose breaking on impact.  Her mind only yielded a bit of clarity as she was lifted up once more.

<em>...comedy...comedy!  My God, let me be funny in this one moment!</em>

Her reached down for the knife lost in the dragon&#39;s quick and, if Lindwyrm deigned fit to look upon the bride it was killing, she was looking back up at him with a macabre smile.

&quot;Why, <em>mon amour,</em> I am beginning to suspect that this counts as an abusive relationship.&quot;

She was slammed into the floor a third time.  Her arm grew limp but kept its grip on the knife as she pulled on it...only for the cacophony of awards and alarms to suddenly be joined by the floor&#39;s creaking turning into cracking, breaking, <em>shattering...!</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>
