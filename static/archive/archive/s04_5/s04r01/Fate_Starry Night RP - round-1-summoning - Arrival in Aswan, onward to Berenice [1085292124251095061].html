The faint rays of sunlight entered the small and clustered cabin room through the window. Karl had slept soundly the entire night. The only reason he woke up was due to the sun rays hitting his eyes. He woke up in total confusion, staring at the book clenched in his hands and having no memory of last night. What had happened? He looked at the cape covering his body and then slowly began to remember...he summoned his servant. He slowly got up and clenched the coat with his free hand. Where was Afonso?
He looked around the room to no avail, it was not his fault that he was unaware that servants could take a spiritual form. He had not yet read through the entire book he was holding in his left hand. He looked at the room, which seemed to carry no one other than Karl himself. Suddenly Karl began to speak, calling out for Afonso like a toddle to his parent:

&quot;Afonso...where are you?&quot;

The boy continued to look around, but Afonso was nowhere to be seen. He worried maybe he had encountered another servant while he was sleeping. Maybe  he was hurt. A lot of thoughts began to rush towards Karl&#39;s head, but he did not let them take over him. Afonso was probably, no definitely OK, maybe he was just using the bathroom?
He carried on looking at the opened briefcase on top of the desk. He quietly approached it and placed the book in it and then proceeded to remove his coat. He folded it perfectly and placed in the briefcase, closing it and looking again expecting for Afonso to just pop up. But, no one appeared. He sighed and got ready. He fixed his shirt and hair which had become quite messy due to his unusual and to be honest uncomfortable sleeping position. He looked again for Afonso, again speaking like an annoyed toddler:

&quot;Afonso where are you! It&#39;s time to go, we have arrived in Aswan!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085300653645111316 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085300653645111316><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, March 14, 2023 3:37 PM">3:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The reason why he knew they had arrived due to the train having stopped minutes before he had woken up. The foggy and dirty window cabin showed him the crowded train station which Karl was not glad he was about to step foot in. His stomach began to growl as he thought of his first activity in Aswan. He will get something to eat, he had not eaten since his departure from Vienna and was, in a sense, starving. He decided to find a place to eat as soon as he set foot in the city. He put his hand in the door knob and remembered:

&quot;Afonso! Wherever you might be, if you hear me, you should probably get dressed. People seeing you in armour will probably think you are a lunatic and you&#39;ll be found out quickly!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You should hurry up, I don&#39;t think this... train, is supposed to stay in here forever.&quot;

He did not know what was happening and nodded to the King&#39;s request. Spiritual Form? He wondered as he twisted the door knob and the door opened showing the crowded hallways of the train, even though there were little to no time left for people to remain in the train. He blinked and closed the door.
Keeping a strong grip over his briefcase he placed his back over the cabin&#39;s door and waited as people began to move past him, if he was not there to begin with. A weird experience, Karl did not know how to feel as he looked down at his feet and yawned. He was still sleepy when he heard a train conductor say something to him. It was obvious the boy did not understand the foreign language, but the conductor was kind enough to show him with signs the exit. Informing him that it was time to go.
Karl knocked once again on the door and exclaimed:

&quot;Afonso hurry! We are already late, I&#39;ll be waiting for you outside, in the train station&quot;

As soon as Karl, set foot on the train station he saw the same scenery that he had previously seen in Cairo. Crowds and crowds of people, cattle and children. He looked around for someone, his father&#39;s friend to be exact, trying to find some sort of sign like in the airport. While in confusion, a hand was placed on his shoulder as chills ran down his spine. He gulped and looked behind seeing a mysterious figure who began to drag him away for the train station with force.

&quot;Afonso!&quot;

Karl exclaimed as he tried to let go. The man was persistent and looked at Karl with a bold and cold stare just saying the words: &quot;Mr. Ro&#223;mann come with me, don&#39;t make this harder than they seem&quot;. A cab was awaiting for them at the entrance of the train station as Karl looked around for Afonso and said:

&quot;Wait, I am waiting for a friend!&quot;

The man looked at him confused and stopped. Nodding as time passed by, it was already 6:30 AM. Karl awaited for Afonso&#39;s arrival in patience.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>It was during this that a knock on the door was heard, with Karl announcing that he would be waiting for him outside. Which meant... that the saber would have to get creative when it came to his next move.</em>

<em>The servant slowly opened the door to the outside of the cabin, turning his head around to notice the absence of any passenger on it&#39;s corridor. A blessing from the Lord and one that Afonso took advantage of as he walked along side it until something caught his eye. A door with a label which had the words &#39;Lost and Founds&#39; on it. That was... promising. They certainly wouldn&#39;t find it odd if some of them mysteriously disappeared.</em>

<em>...</em>

<em>Karl might have waited for quite a time for his friend, but he soon found someone in the middle of the crowd seeming to be looking for someone. His golden hair was similar to the one of his servant but his clothes... Dear Christ. A clearly oversized red football jersey of the Egyptian premier league side, Al Ahly SC, along side some black pants that surprisingly did seem to fit his frame.</em>

<em>It was then that Saber looked directly at his master with his piercing hazel glaze, before walking in his direction. If Karl had any doubts about who that was, they certainly would be gone now.</em>

&quot;...and who exactly might this man be?&quot; <em>Afonso stopped in front of him, before eyeing him up. For the man, it almost felt like Saber one of those rebellious youngsters who had paired up with Karl for some holidays.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Island of Berenice lingered on Karl&#39;s mind, he wanted to explore every bit of it and enjoy it. Of course, he was participating in a Holy Grail War, but that would not stop him from having a bit of fun. He awaited for Afonso as he looked down at the briefcase he was holding tightly and blushed. He had forgotten to give Afonso clothes to change! He looked around in panic looking at an eccentric figure amongst the crowd, his blond hair made him distinguishable amongst the rest. He giggled as Afonso began to approach him.

&quot;This is my father&#39;s friend! He&#39;ll take us to the boat to Berenice!&quot; Karl&#39;s stomach growled &quot;Haha! Maybe I should grab something to eat!&quot;

He looked around and the man nodded, he quickly approached a street food vendor near by and bought a shawarma for the boy to eat while on their way to the port. Karl threw the briefcase on the back of the cab. He entered the cab and began eating, Afonso was probably following him at this point. At around 10:00 AM the couple had arrived on the port. A single ticket was handed to Karl and the man made it obvious that he was not going to pay for Afonso&#39;s ticket, Karl smiled and shook his hand then entered the boat.
They were now only miles away from the island and Karl couldn&#39;t wait, he finished the meal and entered the ferry, finding a comfortable seat and looking at Afonso.

&quot;I&#39;m really excited! I hope to make some friends during the way! But first things first, I think we should explore the city. Or should we check-in on our hotel? Hmmm...I have no clue! What do you think Afonso?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It had seem that his master&#39;s family had been so concerned about their son that they sent someone to guide him to the right place. Considering Karl&#39;s situation and his behavior, Saber found it justifiable. A parent must give the tools that their son&#39;s an daughter&#39;s require to achieve success. His own father did that and his mother.... well, his mother helped him in a different way.</em>

<em>It wouldn&#39;t take too long for them to reach the port, since the horseless vehicle proved itself to be a fast and effective way to reach it. It was such a good transport that Karl had been able to enjoy one of the local&#39;s meals while on it.</em>

<em>Without a ticket, Afonso simply resigned himself as he headed to an isolated place not that far away from the line to the ferry. There were more than one way to enter inside of that vessel, especially for someone with his qualities and abilities. He went to his spiritual form before following his master to the insides of the ferry, where he materialized once more inside of a bathroom.</em>

<em>Upon finding Karl in one of the upper deck&#39;s of the ferry, Saber made sure to sit in the seat closest to his master, before noticing that the ferry didn&#39;t seem to be that full. It was something good considering that someone really was insistent on calling their servant by their actual name. Was Karl not aware of the implications or was he confidant on Afonso&#39;s skills?</em>

&quot;If this hotel so happens to be our base, it would be in our best interest to head there. Visiting the city and seeing what it can offer can wait.&quot; <em>The Saber explained as he observed the port getting smaller and smaller in the distance. Soon enough they would be in the city that would have the honor to be the battlefield of a war of servants and magus. Times wouldn&#39;t be easy, yet just thinking of it was enough to make a smirk appear on the servant&#39;s face.</em> &quot;Enjoy the ride while it lasts Karl, you will find yourself pretty busy once we reach Berenice.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unfortunately I don&#39;t think we can go for a swim at this time of year or can we? I&#39;ll look into that.&quot;

Time had passed quickly on the boat and Karl had began talking rather quickly and it would be understandable that Afonso could be confused at certain points or sentences. He was as happy as toddler, a childish smile having formed in his face as he looked at Afonso. He was approaching Berenice! He was approaching the Holy Grail. He was approaching one of the best tourist attractions! He was approaching the place where he could take his last breath. His stomach began to turn, maybe it was due to sea sickness or the thoughts being tumbled in his mind. Karl felt a need to puke as he rushed towards one of the bathroom stalls.
There he proceeded to vomit everything he had eaten. He was exhausted and looked for Afonso. He was truly scared, hoping the Servant had followed him, he flushed the toilet and looked at the whirlpool. Maybe he was taking this too light heartedly? His gaze was focused on the whirlpool of water, he looked around the stall. Was he doing the right thing? Was he having cold fight only hours away from the island? He began to sweat and began speaking:

&quot;Am I making a giant mistake? Probably. Will I regret this? Definitely. But, I still don&#39;t want to give up. I have to fight for what I think is right, for the ideals I ought to protect. You probably think I&#39;m acting childish and I do not blame you, I let the excitement get in my head, now that we are approaching Berenice, I cannot help but think will I be able to fight in this war? Will I find away to survive without getting my hands dirty? I have no idea. I just pray God has mercy and does not make me face any obstacles.&quot;

He heard the honk of the ship, signalising that they were close to arrival. He turned around, pale and serious.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Well, maybe not that well. As they spotted the island in the distance, Karl was noticeable getting quieter and quieter to the point that he had to leave his side with an excuse to go to the bathroom.

&quot;I had a feeling this would happen eventually.&quot; <em>Afonso murmured to himself after witnessing Karl run up to one of the bathrooms. This type of behavior wasn&#39;t one strange to the King, for he had witnessed many men feeling that way. He was scared of what the future held for him in the battlefield.</em>

<em>Saber made sure to stand in front of the bathroom door, preventing anyone to even try to come inside as he listened his master speak. He spoke about how big of a mistake he was making and doubted his own abilities to survive.</em>

&quot;I am in no position to tell you what to do. It&#39;s your life and you have the right to do your choices. Yet, don&#39;t forget that regardless of your enthusiasm for being here, you still have your wish that you desire to accomplish. When in doubt, just think about it.&quot;

He wasn&#39;t alone in this war, but at the same time he had dragged this Heroic Spirit into it. No, he had himself wanted the Grail or didn&#39;t it work that way? Karl was in a state of confusion. But, having Afonso by his side made him feel better as he listened him confirm that they were in him together, Karl&#39;s smile returned on his face. Though it was not that enthusiastic grin that Afonso had witnessed throughout the journey, but one filled with a little bit of sorrow.
He opened the door of the stall quietly, sneaking behind the servant and hugging him, getting vomit on the already dirty and used shirt. The servant probably had to change to remove the terrible odour from his current clothes. Afonso could feel that just from this little interaction Karl was truly scared for what was about to come, after all he was not that old. In the great scheme of things, he was on the younger side of masters.

&quot;Thank you, Afonso. I&#39;ll make sure to make your proud and do everything for your wish to come true...&quot;

He said to the servant letting go of him and running towards the bathroom to get cleaned. He was tense, but the cold water made him relaxed. He took a deep breath and got out just in time. 
The ship had finally landed in Berenice, he gulped and looked at the island in front of him. A tropical paradise indeed, Karl tried to get his mind off the Holy Grail War for sometime. He got of the boat and waited for Afonso, behind him yet another man was holding a giant sign which read: &quot;Welcome Mr. Ro&#223;mann!&quot;. Karl had not noticed it at all. Be it due to the stress or tense feeling he was having. He looked at the boat one last time, thinking if he would be able to board it again?
As of now, Afonso had became an important figure in the young man&#39;s life. He looked at the King with great admiration and had made up his mind to study anything there was to know about D. Afonso Henriques. He was gonna do his best as a master.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086390514548494396 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086390514548494396><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 17, 2023 3:48 PM">3:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His skin began to regain colour, his smile reappeared on his face as he looked at the boat for one last time before turning and noticing the sign.

<em>Nothing to complain about it. He wasn&#39;t considering keeping that jersey must forward so enduring it for just a little longer shouldn&#39;t be too hard.</em>

<em>By the time that Karl got ready, the King had already been standing outside, briefcase in his hand watching as the different boats sail away from the port while keeping his eye on the vessel that had brought them here. It was beautiful scenery on Afonso&#39;s mind.</em>

He had already gotten used to this as he looked from the backseat window the beauty of the city, even though winter, the streets were filled with tourists taking pictures and having fun. Karl smiled bitterly as he closed his eyes and fell asleep. By the time, he woke up, the cab had stopped and his briefcase was being carried up to the hotel he was staying. 
It was luxurious to say the least, as soon as he stepped outside of the cab, he was faced with a big sign where the name of the hotel was places followed by 5 stars beneath it. The reception was wonderful, with a circular roof made of glass, allowing plenty of sunshine to enter. Red sofas were placed all over it and next to them were small glass tables with magazines and a single golden lamp on top of them. The reception was crescent shaped and a kind woman greeted Karl and introduced herself.
She quickly took his hand and lead him to the hotel&#39;s elevator. There Karl was amazed, he looked at the floor numbers and saw around 10 of them, he blinked and noticed that he was surrounded by mirrors. Looking around for Afonso, he hoped that he was experiencing the same kind of joy and amazement that he was. They quickly arrived on the 5th floor, where they were staying.
The nice receptionist handed him a key and left them to be. Karl took a deep breath, there was no turning back now, he had to do what had to be done, he opened the door and was yet again left mesmerised by the beauty of it. It consisted of a wide living room and kitchen, on the left of Karl there was yet another door. He opened it to see the main bedroom, a single king sized bed and on the left of it a balcony with a sea side view. He blushed and turned to look at Afonso:

&quot;This is so amazing! We&#39;re gonna have so much fun Afonso!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1086980096079970324 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1086980096079970324><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 6:50 AM">6:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He threw his briefcase on the floor and himself on the bed, giggling like a child.

It certainly had it&#39;s beauty and charm, even with some more... creative designs for some of it&#39;s buildings such as that one with the giant yellow &quot;M&quot; on it. The old King could only wonder what nefarious activities were performed on it.</em>

<em>Was Saber thinking of the subject when the cab suddenly stopped in front of a rather outstanding looking building, one that seemed to be reserved for the best of the best. It was... certainly impressive looking on the outside and the inside wasn&#39;t behind either, with this place seeming to be the perfect zone for a King to be.</em>

<em>...</em>

<em>Perhaps a bit too perfect in the eyes of Afonso. Karl while naive didn&#39;t seem to be the type of person who would arrange his own place of stay so that meant... it had been his family to arrange this as well. Curious...</em>

<em>Upon finding himself inside of the room, Saber would throw finally throw away of what remained of the jersey. It had serviced it&#39;s purpose and would now be discarded from his possession. Had it not been for the servant&#39;s respect for the ones who worked in their fortress, he would have casted the cursed piece of clothing out of the window and be done with it.</em>

&quot;Fun while be something that we will most certainly have, yet I must inquire...&quot; <em>After watching Karl go back to his more childish persona, Afonso ended up sitting by the edge of the bed, close to where his master had so carefreely thrown himself into it.</em> &quot;Is there anything regarding your position in this event that you might want to know more about?

He smiled at the man next to him and quickly got up stretching his arms. He looked around the room trying to find anything to drink. On the dining table there was a bottle with what seemed some sort of alcohol. It was only logical that they needed to celebrate, but first Karl opened his briefcase. It seemed like he was searching for something and pulled a Hawaiian shirt from it. A huge mess was caused around the briefcase with clothes having been thrown everywhere. He quickly approached the servant and handed it the shirt with a big smile on his face, then he proceeded to grab the bottle and try to open it. No lock. He sighed.

&quot;Afonso! Can you help me open this, I have no idea how to!&quot;

He yet again approached the servant, similar to a child approaching his parent for help. Maybe Karl reminded Afonso of one of his children, maybe not, maybe he reminded him of a court jester. Either way Karl was quite thrilled with the recent events. He was glad he had gotten to summon such a kind and gentle soul, it really mirrored him in a sense. With his hand extended, Karl suddenly had a realisation. He had not told Afonso anything about his Magecraft. Well it made sense, Afonso did not tell him anything about his &quot;hidden arsenal&quot;, but Karl could not wait and began to yet again speak, loudly with excitement. The room which up till now was dull, covered by a thing sheet of luxury and nothing more began to gain a bit of colour as the boy spoke with his childish sounding voice:

&quot;Afonso! I did not tell you anything about my abilities, I forgot, I&#39;m sorry. But wait you haven&#39;t told me anything too? Maybe we should get to know each other better. Also now that we are in Berenice do you have any nicknames I can call you by, since Afonso might make people doubt.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088208963927035994 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088208963927035994><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 22, 2023 4:13 PM">4:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Karl showed for what might be the first time, a sign of maturity that was inside of him.

It was... a shirt with some flower pattern-</em>

<em>Before handing it over to him.</em> &quot;Thank you... As I was saying, considering what I have to offer, the most difficult servant class that we would have to deal with would probably be the archer class. Those servants specialize in attacking their foes from a distance and I don&#39;t have in my possession any weapon that would help us deal with a foe at a long range.&quot;

<em>It was as Afonso finished speaking that he noticed how the young man struggled to open the bottle of alcohol before... handing it over to him with a pleading look. The portuguese king could only sigh before grabbing it. This all felt like he was dealing with Sancho all over again.</em>

<em>He grabbed the sheath that held it&#39;s sword in place before using it to cut the section of the bottle that held the cork, finally allowing anyone who had a desire to drink it&#39;s contents to satisfy themselves.</em>

&quot;I believe this room is safe so there shouldn&#39;t be any danger for me to reveal to you what I have to offer.&quot; *The servant announced to his master, willing to say what he can or could do to aid Karl in his mission to obtain the holy grail. But beforehand, it had seemed like the young man had finally brought the one point that he wished to be cleared up now. The way Afonso wishes to be called by. 

&quot;...Moniz. It&#39;s the name of an old acquaintance of mine but it should work as a simple name for you to address me by. If we find ourselves facing another master however, just call me by Saber.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The smell of alcohol quickly spread all over the room and mixed with a hibiscus scent that was coming from outside. The window had been left slightly opened and as Karl took a sip, he quickly closed it.

The boy listened with great interest to the things that Afonso had to say to him, it was unfortunate that he knew this little about the King. He had decided to check the town&#39;s library for any information, but was uncertain whether or not he would find anything and even if he did he would be unable to understand it. He could not contact his parents, he did not know whether or not it was safe, he began to check for something on his back pockets and pulled from it a wrinkled up photo. Sitting on a chair in the bedroom placed next to the wide window, he looked at it and teared up. It was a photo of him and his mother, he really began to miss her scent and remembered the missed calls. He took a deep breath and a grin began to reappear on his face.

Karl yet again got up in a hurry, this actions of sitting and getting up were getting rather repetitive and his joints were starting to hurt. He looked out of the window yet again the ocean view mesmerising him. Archer, a terrible class to face, did he have anything in his arsenal to face it with? He was uncertain. Well, he might have. It was best to talk with the all knowing king, holding the glass in his hand, some of the alcohol had spilled on the floor when he had gotten up, he raised the glass and proceeded to say:

&quot;To Moniz and Karl! The future winners of this Holy Grail War!&quot;

He winked at Afonso at took a big sip. He placed the glass on the bed side table and sat yet again. It was time for them to discuss with one another, this room was sealed no one could enter it and they were safe. Afonso had showed Karl everything now it was time for Karl to show the King his potential.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1089509594285473832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1089509594285473832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 6:22 AM">6:22 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>.
&quot;Unlike other masters we might encounter, I do not specialise in only one kind of Magecraft. It&#39;s a long story and I do not wish to get into details why that is, but there are two Magecrafts I am able of performing, Potential Magecraft and Particle Magecraft. The latter of which is the von Ro&#223;mann&#39;s holy Magecraft, it&#39;s more of alchemy in a sense. I am able to change the property of metals basically, change iron into copper and that sort of stuff, as long as I am not dealing with Gold, Silver and such things. While Potential Magecraft, which I am more experienced with, allows me to reach inhuman speeds. Thus, I can close the distance problem between Archers or so I think. I might not have the most versatile kit, you can be the judge of that. But, I&#39;ll do my best with it.&quot;

Karl looked at the ring placed on his index finger. He was uncertain whether or not Afonso had noticed the accessory and got up. He looked determined and ready for Berenice turning to face the windows and taking a deep breath.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Saber picked up the half filled glass of alcohol before shaking it around noticing how light it was. This glass while elegant in appearance, was fragile and easy to shatter.

&quot;So you can use that sort of alchemy in your favor... Not only that, but you can reach speeds superior&#39;s to those of your average human.&quot; <em>He mused outwards while rubbing his chin.</em>
