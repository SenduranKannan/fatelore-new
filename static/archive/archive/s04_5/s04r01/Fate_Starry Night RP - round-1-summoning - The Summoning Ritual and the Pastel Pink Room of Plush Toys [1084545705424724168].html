A small inconspicuous cottage stood near a pond in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by vegetation and trees. This was not a very good piece of land - far from society and very inconvenient, simply going for groceries would take a few hours and the soil wasn&#39;t suitable to create any produce on your own. Even despite the incredibly low cost, no one would buy this cottage. But at this moment in time, light could be seen in the windows. Who could be the person to buy a piece of land that worthless?

&quot;This one... Yeah, I&#39;ll take this one!&quot; A short, pale young man with long hair was standing near a wardrobe, choosing stylish clothing to put on. &quot;Fingerless gloves- Oh, I could put this glove on my left hand instead! Assymetry is good too! Aaand...&quot; Cody proceeded to run up to a full length mirror nearby and spin around, admiring himself. &quot;Perfect! I bet whatever servant I&#39;ll summon will be impressed! Now where should I do the ritual?&quot; He started walking around his house. A confectionary kitchen, a bedroom and a pastel pink room full of different plush toys. Blood would be required for the ritual, so Cody at first tried to ignore these options so those rooms won&#39;t be dirtied. &quot;It&#39;s still not dark enough to do it outside. The basement is suuuuper boring! Oh! Maybe the servant will like my plush toys! If I&#39;m careful enough they won&#39;t get stained.&quot;

And so Cody opened the door to the pastel room. He moved all the teddy bears and different plush animals away for the center of the room and drew a summoning circle. &quot;Ah, I forgot to get the catalyst. Should&#39;ve done this earlier. Eh, whatever! This will work fine without it! Wait, the blood. I forgot to buy a live chicken! Ugh. I&#39;ll have to use mine...&quot; He removed the fingerless glove off of his right hand ant put it into a pocket, before taking a dagger with his left hand. He moved the dagger closer to his right hand and then stopped.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084545985474207815 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084545985474207815><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 12, 2023 1:38 PM">1:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Come on Cody, you&#39;re not even in danger, why are you afraid already? It&#39;s just some blood. Just some blood. And the start of a war with so much more blood... I have to do it! I can&#39;t stay in fear forever. It will be easy, I just have to begin. It&#39;s just a grail war...&quot; 

So he stood there and waited, pointlessly waited for his fear to stop. Fear always followed him throughout his life, and he knew that fear won&#39;t stop until he fights it. After all, bravery is not about being fearless, it&#39;s about fighting off one&#39;s fears. 

Cody took a deep breath and started blocking off all of his thoughts. Then he focused on making a cut on his right hand - and after some time he did. As the pain from the cut appeared and the blood poured onto the summoning circle, his mind started racing. What if something goes wrong? What if he&#39;ll die? What will he do if he doesn&#39;t actually want the grail? It was too late for such thoughts, as the ritual started and was waiting for his chant. Too late to turn back.

&quot;...Let zephyr and moonlight be the essence, let the sky and the clouds be the foundation, let rise a wall against the wind that shall fall!&quot;
&quot;I hereby exclaim! Your spirit shall anchor to me and my fate shall be your dagger! Hear the voice of the Holy Grail and answer!&quot;
&quot;An oath shall be sworn here! I shall attain the courage of a lion! We shall have the strength to win!&quot;

Even for a third-rate magus, they wouldn&#39;t mess up formalcraft so horribly. Should this summoner be praised for accomplishing such an impossible deed?

Fortunately for this young Master, with all his strange girly tendencies, the servant he was summoning was one that fit most of his hopes. One that was brave, strong, and mightier than steel. But &quot;it&quot; certainly did <em>not</em> share the same interests as his new contractor&#39;s...

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><em><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">&quot;Come forth from a place beyond, protector of the holy balance!&quot;</code></em>
</div></div>
That final incantation which triggered the summoning of a servant. A hero from an age long past, but was still sung praises of even until today. The minimum qualification for one to become a Heroic Spirit. To be brave, and to possess a great bravery that resounds throughout the annals of history. That is the individual the white-haired freelancer was summoning.

Along the traces of blood that dyed the summoning circle, a ferocious flame combusted. But it was immediately extinguished by a far more ferocious wind, scattering the plush animals everywhere around the room, filling the space with a chaotic mess of stuffed toys. In the eye of this uproarious storm, a towering figure stood tall with his back straightened like the strongest obsidian.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>&quot;In accordance to your call, <em>I</em> have been summoned...!&quot;</strong>
</div></div>
Broad shoulders like mountain peaks, and flowing red hair like a crimson sky. His petrifying visage, along with his equally-intimidating deafening voice, overwhelmed the entire space. The regal-dressed servant&#39;s intimidating presence spread out to all corners of the room, and bounced back off the walls.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084798287963492382 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084798287963492382><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, March 13, 2023 6:21 AM">6:21 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
...He realized that his feet were submerged in teddy bears. His golden eyes were then blinded by the sheer colors of the pastel-dyed world. His mouth, which was prepared to continue his introductory speech, was closed again. Words simply could not form on the tip of his tongue. He had been rendered speechless.

And when he recovered from his shock, the newly-summoned servant was unable to find the location of his summoner. Perhaps his contractor was submerged in this... gargantuan hill of plush animals?

He did not consider for even a moment that his Master might be too short, and his body stature might be too tall.

Coming into conclusion, the servant believed that he ought to save his master from such the powerful bindings of this strange threat. Manifesting his spear—the red Lancer was ready to cleanse his new enemies, to purge them from existence for the sake of all that is good... Brown-colored teddy bears, pink-colored teddy bears, and white-colored teddy bears. And all sorts and varities of other plush animals.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The entire cottage would&#39;ve become a land of fluff and imaginary animals too if the door was opened. 

&quot;Not my stuffed animals!&quot; In panic, Cody tried to save the soft wooly creatures by protecting them from the wind with his arms, but the exhaustion from summoning a servant turned out to be too great and the powerful wind threw him onto the ground. &quot;Wwooooaaaahh-&quot; His scream was muffled by the dozens of teddy bears completely burying him, leaving only a small hill behind.

In a few seconds the storm subsided, and Cody popped out of the hill. He shook his long ruffled hair and pulled out his cape out from under the fluffy toys before dusting himself off. What he saw in front of him was a powerful, awe-inspiring warrior dressed in a beautiful regal outfit - there was no mistake, this is the servant he summoned. The only thing he could do is whisper in admiration. &quot;Woah... So tall...&quot; Something was wrong however. There was a spear in this emperor&#39;s hands, and Cody could feel what seemed to be murderous intent directed at the various teddy bears. And so he immediately ran at the king while stretching out his hands forward to protect the fuzzy toys. 

&quot;Waitwaitwait! Don&#39;t destroy the little plush beasts, they&#39;re friends! None of those toy animals are trained in warfare or big enough to pose any threat!&quot; Cody then stopped and looked around, first turning his head at the meter tall giant teddy bear in the corner which was too heavy to get pushed around by the wind, and then at the plush dog in a tiny military helmet laying among the pastel sea of fur, disproving his claims that all of them were small and none of them were soldiers. &quot;Uh. Ignore mister Chubsy and private Treehater. They&#39;re still friends by the way!&quot;

It will be soooo fun to get the grail with you! Oh! Your clothing looks chinese, so maybe you&#39;re that general. Sun Tzu! Yeah, that must be it! Will you teach me how to fight wars better?&quot; As Cody endlessly threw words at the Lancer, he completely forgot that he had to introduce himself first.

The surprised Lancer turned his head downwards, and met with the appearance of a young, overly-cheerful boy. The sparkle-eyed magus wasn&#39;t showing any malicious intent, so the emperor did not move to attack the boy, but he did not dismiss his spear yet.

The servant&#39;s gaze closely observed Cody&#39;s body, searching for any traces of a Command Seal. Trailing down to the freelancer&#39;s right hand, marked with a bright glowing-red tattoo, as well as the feeling of a magical resonance existing between the two individuals, the Lancer recognized that this bubbly &quot;child&quot; was his Master. That was when he finally lowered his guard.

At last, the red-haired emperor dismissed his silver spear, and then... he was bombarded with various sets of questions that he was unable to answer in as such quick succession as his summoner had inquired. Though, that didn&#39;t mean he was unable to react to them. Perks of being a Servant.

But he remained slightly surprised because he was unable to notice his Master&#39;s presence. Perhaps it was because the latter was too short and he was too tall, or that the latter was a trained assassin? Both could be true, and both could be false.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1085505535308218368 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1085505535308218368><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 15, 2023 5:11 AM">5:11 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He also quickly noted that the plush animals were apparently Cody&#39;s &quot;friends&quot;... Such girly toys were unbefitting of a man, he thought. But the red Lancer refrained from commenting on that part, as he believed that his new Master was still a growing adolescent and expressed sympathy, for the latter&#39;s appearance was not much different from a teenage boy. Therefore, he believed that there was still more than enough time for his contractor to mature and discard those stuffed toys, even if it would take a very long time.

And the Lancer said so firmly, because he was fully confident that they would win this Holy Grail War. <em>1st death flag planted</em>

So don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t have to teach me anything. I was in multiple warzones within the past decade, you know! Just Sun Tzu knows a little more about fighting than we do, because he invented it, I think! He could easily teach us both a lot about the art of war in a short time if he was there, mhm!&quot;

Cody then walked in the direction of the door while carefully pushing the plushies to the sides with his boots, forming a clean path to the exit so neither or the two persons in the room accidentally steps directly onto them.

&quot;But I&#39;m sure you can do something that Sun Tzu cannot! Everyone is unique of course. Before we introduce ourselves to each other though, why won&#39;t we go to a... Less ludicrous room? You don&#39;t seem very amused by my fluffy toy animals, I can tell.&quot; He then opened the door, revealing the much more subdued colors of the world outside the pastel plush dimension. 

&quot;So what are you waiting for? Follow me!&quot; Cody proceeded to grab Lancer&#39;s arm and started leading him through his cottage, eventually reaching a relatively normal looking kitchen with a table in the middle. Then he released the arm and quickly turned to look at Gao.

&quot;Wait. You didn&#39;t seem to like the teddy bears that much, right? But maybe you&#39;ll like this! Look!&quot; He proceeded to smile widely and point both of his arms at the refrigerator in an exaggerated manner, as if it was something very impressive. 

&quot;Uhh... Oh, right.&quot; After pausing for a second, Cody opened the refrigerator and grabbed a plate with a chocolate tart which had strawberry slices beautifully arranged on the top, before putting it on the table and doing the same pointing action he did with the refrigerator a few seconds ago. &quot;Ta-da! A chocolate strawberry tart! One of the greatest desserts! A thin and crispy crust, a sweet and creamy chocolate filling, and all of that richness is balanced by the tartness- Ehe, <em>tart</em>ness- of the strawberries! Wanna try? You&#39;ll love it!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1087083947583885344 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1087083947583885344><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, March 19, 2023 1:43 PM">1:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="lens_the_martyr">@Lens</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It dated back to the most ancient of times, and was developed collectively by humans from all around the world, but Lancer didn&#39;t wish to interrupt his Master&#39;s mood during this occasion.

With this thought hanging on his mind, the red servant allowed himself to be dragged away by his contractor, towards a relatively-more &quot;normal&quot; place: the modern kitchen. He wasn&#39;t used to the modern era&#39;s sleek and polished furniture yet, but in his opinion, anything was better than that pastel-colored underworld. Or that hell of plushies.

Clearing away his distracting thoughts, Lancer regained focus in his eyes and stared at the plate of tart laid out on the table in front of him. It was made with all sorts of ingredients he didn&#39;t recognize, but Lancer knew it must&#39;ve been expensive. It was the most exquisite dish he had seen, of the current age.

Yes, he certainly desired to possess it. A baked pastry with a perfectly round circumference, and a mouthwatering appearance. However, Lancer knew he was no longer human.

A servant didn&#39;t require such an exquisite meal. They could simply live off pure magical energy. They were weapons, not gourmets. Therefore, he displayed a slightly pensive look on his face for a split second, and then took a step back away from the appetizing tart. His Master, who was <s>(not)</s> in the prime of his life, should enjoy this dish fully. 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>&quot;I apologize, but I must pass on your offer, Master. I am a Servant: your weapon. Weapons have never partaken in the dining table, but only in the flesh and blood of their enemies&#39; remains. In other words, I am completely incompatible with this dish.&quot;</strong>
</div></div>
Though he attempted to make a convincing remark, if one paid closer attention to his general attitude, they would find that Lancer harbored slight feelings of regret. But his loyalty took priority to his personal feelings, so those emotions quickly disappeared like a fleeting wind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ll have you know, I put quite a bit of effort into making this tart. There are more difficult desserts to make out there of course, but I&#39;d be happy to have someone try it! And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re gonna eat the entire tart at once. It&#39;s not a tartlet, we&#39;re supposed to cut it into slices and share anyways! And knives are weapons, but they&#39;re used at the dining table, aren&#39;t they?&quot; 

But then he frowned; or at least tried to, as the closest thing to a frown his joyful face could reach was a neutral expression. Having been raised by assassins, Cody&#39;s parents frequently insisted that he is a weapon, someone born only to kill. While he tried to resist, openly objecting was not something that could be done in a familiy of trained killers, and so he did nothing about it. This was slowly but surely turning Cody more distant and emotionless, which drained his cheerful soul. After his lucky escape, he realized how terrible that mindset was. And because of that experience, what his servant said worried him. 

For Cody&#39;s next words, his voice switched to a somewhst serious tone. &quot;But, uh. Do not call yourself a weapon, please? This isn&#39;t the best mindset. I used to think that way, but that didn&#39;t get me anywhere good. And let me use your own words; you are a servant. That does not mean that you&#39;re a weapon, that means you&#39;re a warrior. And many leaders across time hired warriors and rewarded them! So enjoy this meal! Think of this as me trying to earn your loyalty.&quot; 

He then grabbed a kitchen knife, took a slice of the tart and put it onto a second, smaller plate. &quot;We probably should introduce ourselves now, yeah? My name is Cody. I&#39;m a freelancer magus and formerly an assassin. And since you&#39;re not Sun Tzu, I wonder who you might be? A king of some sorts?&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, March 26, 2023 6:20 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1088065840596918342 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1088065840596918342><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, March 22, 2023 6:45 AM">6:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="lens_the_martyr">@Lens</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

</div></div>
A small protest leaked out of the Lancer&#39;s mouth in response to Cody&#39;s request. And a few moments later, a slight chuckle. It was a tiny, quiet laugh, but it was still discernible to nearby people, such as Cody. Though it only lasted for a few seconds, it seemed that the tiniest hole had been pierced into Lancer&#39;s firm belief.

Thus, even if he treated his current circumstances, or the current situation, as nothing more than a mere joke, he acted slightly differently to what he had been in life. Someone who was constantly burdened with defending his homeland, and carried the burden of over a thousand people&#39;s expectations and hope.

Now, however, he could perhaps afford a momentary break.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>&quot;Alright. If it&#39;s your order, Master.&quot;</strong>
</div></div>
But even if that was what Lancer claimed, he would still continue treating himself as a weapon. In his mind, a &#39;warrior&#39; and a &#39;weapon&#39; were one and the same concept, for a warrior was not a &#39;warrior&#39; without his &#39;weapon&#39;. In addition, Lancer was a Servant. Somehow, which by all means, would be treated as a &#39;weapon&#39; of mass destruction by the general populace, should he ever be revealed to the public.

That didn&#39;t mean it was impossible to shake his belief in this concept, though. For now, it was better to think about other things that were more important, such as introducing oneselves.

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><strong>&quot;You&#39;re half-correct, Master.

With each word he spoke, his calm and steady voice gradually grew more and more imposing, as if overflowing with regal dignity. At the same time, a trace of melancholy could be felt from it. It seemed as if he was slightly reminiscing about the distant past.

Something that only he experienced, and no one else. The uniqueness that made up a Heroic Spirit, and differentiated them from other similarly-legendary or mythical figures.
