&#39;Go on, eat up.&#39; 

Lachlan encouraged his dinner buddies with an unusual display of hospitality. The trio - consisting of him, Roland, and Bill - sat around a table in the airport lounge, surrounded by a scrumptious assortment of delivery food.

It was just past 2 in the morning. The airport was dead quiet, save for a handful of people trickling in for an early international flight. The aroma of food at such an insane hour made heads turn in their direction, causing some to glance over in annoyance while others looked on with envy. Roland was fidgeting more than usual in his seat, the attention of his fellow travelers stabbing him like needles on the back.

Sensing his discomfort, Lachlan pushed a can of soda towards him.

&#39;At least get some fluids in,&#39; he coaxed, playing up the role of a perfect host in public space. &#39;You didn&#39;t eat much at dinner, and we&#39;ve got at least six hours to go until our first in-flight meal.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 30, 2023 7:20 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned a heavy-duty paper box upside down, causing a shower of crumbs to fall onto his own plate, which had been barely touched since they had sat down.

&#39;—We&#39;re out of fried chicken.&#39; A well-timed <em>crunch</em> at his side. Lachlan glanced at Bill, who was wolfing down food like there was no tomorrow while donning the shirt and cap of a baggage handler. 

&#39;At least one of you appreciates the gesture,&#39; he pushed bits of food around on his own plate, instead choosing to satiate himself by people-watching. &#39;You do realize that there&#39;s a lot of physical labor waiting for you afterwards, right?

While Roland and Lachlan continued their little lover&#39;s spat, Archer focused on the food at hand. He had no need for sustenance beyond mana, but like hell was he passing up the chance to try out more of the modern world&#39;s cuisine. America had become far larger than the sum of its parts, now hosting cuisine from all over the globe, all packaged under the convenient layer of fast food.

&quot;If you don&#39;t want it,&quot; He interrupted Roland mid speech, stealing a box of chicken nuggets from them and scarfing them down. &quot;-mmmm.&quot; He moaned, ruffling his beard as he cast Roland an apologetic look. &quot;Seemed like a waste.&quot;

His little act caught the attention of Lachlan, who seemed to be slightly worried about his circus show making it through customs. Bill licked grease off his fingers as he nodded repeatedly.  &quot;They take bribes here, right? Just slip &#39;em a bill in the pocket. All pigs are the same.&quot; He said through the noise of meaty bites being chewed down.

&quot;You look rich enough to afford that, so why not give it a try? If that fails, we could always plant some dope on him and let him take the fall while we sneak past.&quot; He tilted his head at Roland. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And a bit of well-timed <em>persuasion</em> can work wonders. It&#39;s how they did it in the Old West, bribery and all that. You of all people should know this.&#39;

He ribbed Roland, knowing that the blonde had no comeback to that. Roland, being the resident fanatic of stories of cowboys and people like Bill, let out an indistinct grumble before diverting his attention back to his food.

Lachlan leaned back in his seat with a can of soda, watching Bill demolish Roland&#39;s portions. Normally, being in the presence of someone who could eat with such gusto would whet one&#39;s own appetite as well, but the more Lachlan watched Bill tear into the juicy chunks of protein, the less hungry he felt.

No, it had nothing to do with tableside manners. 

To distract himself, Lachlan shifted the conversation away from the act of eating and onto the person himself. &#39;So, I take it that you find modern cuisine to your liking?&#39; He asked the gunslinger-in-disguise. &#39;Considering you&#39;ve only been dead for a century. Was food really that dreadful a hundred years ago?&#39;

For what it was worth, he did do a bit of research on Cherokee Bill after getting back to the mansion. Roland had also offered to share his old collection of cowboy movies and comics, but Lachlan didn&#39;t share the same level of enthusiasm. In the end, he settled for dry books from the library to learn about the notorious outlaw. 

It never crossed his mind that he could have simply asked the man himself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1091277899073593344 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1091277899073593344><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, March 31, 2023 3:28 AM">3:28 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan&#39;s eloquent side was showing, something that he had learned since he was a child at magus etiquette classes. Someone with prized magic circuits should look dignified, first and foremost. Bill met that with the beauty of numerous burps and belches, clearly stuffed after that sizable meal, if Servants were even capable of feeling full.

&quot;Ya ya! Food was good there, is good now,&quot; Bill swung his head left, then right. &quot;and maybe it&#39;s even better now, but good food is still good food.&quot; He stated, plain and simple, before taking a look at the building around them.

&quot;What wasn&#39;t around a hundred years ago though? All of this.&quot; He waved around, pointing at the building&#39;s walls, the potted plants, the glass frames and the trash cans. &quot;It was a desert. I remember it clear as day. Maybe some stray rivers here and there. You&#39;re telling me y&#39;all dug up this in only a hundred years?&quot; He whistled.

&quot;Sheeeesh. People are scary, man. Everything for just a drop of gold.&quot; The cowboy stood up, pinching with his fingers as he mentioned small steps backed by gigantic consequences. &quot;But that&#39;s what makes us people, right? Gotta get rich to make it out there. Though, you seem plenty rich already, mister.&quot; He stared at Lachlan.

Then, before Bill could contradict him, added, &#39;Not in our backyard, mind you, but where we&#39;re <em>headed</em>, there&#39;s much to see.&#39;

His gaze flicked towards the gigantic flight information board near the entrance of the lounge. 

&#39;If you&#39;re a fan of deserts, then Egypt will be right up your alley. There&#39;s more barren wasteland than cities there, and what they&#39;ve got is way less advanced. Maybe you&#39;ll find familiarity there and build all the sandcastles your heart desires.&#39; He teased.

&#39;As for me, I&#39;ll focus more on the <em>people</em>,&#39; He continued with more of a determined edge to his voice. &#39;Roland has been doing some digging, and it seems that we&#39;ll be crossing paths with more Servants than your standard six. The Grail&#39;s obviously been rigged,&#39; he concluded with an air of certainty.

He fell silent for a moment as Bill posed a question, instead taking his time sipping on his drink before eventually responding. 

&#39;What, you chickening out?&#39; He raised an eyebrow.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve heard of it.&quot; Bill shook his head. Foreign lands and countries always seemed to escape his mind. All he knew was the desert, and the Indian territory. He was no geographer, instead he simply felt the world around him. This feeling was particularly intense while they were still in America, most likely due to his native country giving him boosts in parameters that he wasn&#39;t even aware of.

&quot;I think you&#39;ve misunderstood: I <strong>love</strong> this! None of those long stretches of nothing or scorching sand underneath your feet. It&#39;s buildings and roads and cars for miles and miles!&quot; Bill replied, enthusiastic. The Wild West no longer being as &#39;wild&#39; was like a dream come true to him: No longer did he have to hide away in caves or rocks that were guarded by his Cherokee allies. To his left, there was Burger King. To his right, McDonalds. Safe havens everywhere. America was finally a free country, where every outlaw could find respite in the wilderness, because there was no longer a &#39;wilderness&#39;, just civilization for miles.

But he wasn&#39;t drunk enough on his own stupor to not notice Lachlan&#39;s gradual coaxing. He was clearly grooming Archer to prepare themselves for upcoming battles, already envisioning the war in his mind and placing his pawns like a strategist on a chessboard. He didn&#39;t mind being a centerpiece, since that was the role of an enforcer. However, he did feel unsatisfied with that answer.

&quot;Not at all. In fact, if you had chickened out, you would have found a gun right between your balls.&quot; Bill giggled as Lachlan noticed that the gun was no longer in the cowboy&#39;s holster. He could not see it in the Servant&#39;s hands either. &quot;But while I know how much my pay is worth, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re aiming for. Would you rob a bank if you wanted $500, but your friend only wanted $50? I wouldn&#39;t, because someone with that half-assed attitude would probably just stab me in the back.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092566186417455154 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092566186417455154><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 3, 2023 4:47 PM">4:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He paused, then leaned forward, taking a step with every passing second. He towered above Lachlan, a black mass that resembled the shadow of death itself. Bill slowly extended his arm, opening his palm as it headed for Lachlan&#39;s neck. The Dowling heir could feel a slight chill, as if their body was warning them. Archer was aiming for a choke, but then angled his arm down and grabbed a stray chicken nugget.

&quot;So, how hungry?&quot; Bill asked, before devouring the nugget whole. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But just as quickly, he regained his composure and smoothed his expression back into one of casual indifference. It was a subtle change, imperceptible to most, but Bill was no ordinary man. His keen eyes caught every nuance: the tensing of Lachlan&#39;s muscles, the brief downward flick of his eyes before they looked back ahead, feigning disinterest.

&#39;You better not be all talk, Billy boy.&#39; With one swift motion, he kicked Bill&#39;s chair back from under the table. The missing gun tumbled out of its hiding spot, landing in the puppeteer&#39;s waiting hand. Taking advantage of Bill&#39;s towering presence, Lachlan dropped the gun into an empty sandwich container before shutting its lid tight, using his body as a shield to keep their &#39;transaction&#39; out of sight.

&#39;Here&#39;s something else you&#39;d do well to remember while you&#39;re still getting used to the 20th century,&#39; he cautioned the Archer, cutting him off mid-reach for another piece of chicken nugget as he shoved the sandwich box back in his hand. &#39;Flaunting your weapon in public isn&#39;t exactly the epitome of courage. It&#39;s a surefire way to end up behind bars before you even set foot in a bank. And if the job is to rob a bank...&#39;

He met Bill&#39;s gaze with his own hard-edged stare. &#39;Naturally, we&#39;ll clean out the whole vault.&#39;

&#39;So let me be clear on this. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s fifty or fifty grand at stake. The only thing I want is the Grail, and I&#39;m not settling for anything less,&#39; he tightened his grip on the sandwich box, crinkling the cardboard. &#39;Do you understand me?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092855692110594158 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092855692110594158><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 11:58 AM">11:58 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Some men were born leaders, others were followers. Some were stuck in between, too weak to decide which direction to pursue. A contradiction was like a gun without bullets: Something that defeated its own purpose. What was the point of a gun, if not to fire?

&quot;You need to lighten up.&quot; Bill sneered as Lachlan handed him back the gun in a sandwich box. &quot;Bill Cook had a stick up his ass, one made of dynamite. Nowhere near as a sour puss like you though.&quot; The cowboy chuckled, feeling the intensity of Lachlan&#39;s grip. He listened to their manifesto, patiently. It only took around six words for him to be sold.

&quot;That&#39;s what I call mighty fine business.&quot; Bill hollered, gripping the sandwich box with his other arm and grabbing Lachlan&#39;s palm in the process. He then exerted a bit more strength, enough to raise the Master&#39;s arm up and down in a very rough handshake. &quot;We got ourselves a deal. All in and all out.&quot; Bill released his hold, dragging out the gun and holstering it once again.

&quot;No weapons in public. Got it.&quot; He tilted his head with a sigh, but showed himself capable of understanding. &quot;Can I shoot when I feel threatened though?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then, remembering the night on the lake, he continued with a sly grin. &#39;Little meat puppets dancing to my tune, perhaps?&#39;

See, he <em>could</em> lighten up, if need be. But few things gave him a reason to. It was always one thing or another that needed fixing. Plans that needed retooling.

&#39;You died at twenty,&#39; he said, gray eyes narrowing into slits. &#39;In a few weeks I&#39;ll officially be older than you.&#39;

A petty retort. But one that dodged the issue. With the disastrous family dinner still fresh on the boys&#39; minds, Bill couldn&#39;t have picked a worse time to crack parent jokes.

&#39;Written proofs are virtually useless. Anyone can forge a document. Verbal agreements are even more unreliable. Memories fade, and words can be twisted. And blood pacts? Come on, we&#39;re not operating a cult here.&#39;

His hand instinctively went to the back of his neck at the mention of Command Seals. &#39;Don&#39;t you lecture me about them. We both know they matter as much to you as they do to me. In an emergency, they could save your life as much as they do mine, but beyond that, they&#39;re just another link in a chain that can be easily broken.

He nudged the empty chair with the tip of his shoe, silently urging Bill to take a seat lest he continue to attract unnecessary attention in his current attire and posture.

They were the only thing keeping Lachlan as the gang&#39;s &#39;ringleader&#39;, after all. Once they were gone, Bill was no longer forced to view him as his boss.

But for now, he was definitely his owner, and he acted like one, giving him immediate orders. &quot;Yessir.&quot; Bill replied in his usual, smug tone, waving for his Master and slave to leave. He tossed plastic and cardboard into trash cans and ate any remaining traces of food. It was a sinful to waste good food, after all.

With that all done, he grabbed Lachlan&#39;s luggage and dragged it around, trailing behind his Master like an ideal serf. Not even the Cook Gang had him work on such demeaning tasks. Despite that, shame never crossed his mind. All he saw was opportunity.

Lachlan worked Bill like a mule, hauling the weight of several full-sized suitcases onto the conveyor belt. Meanwhile, Roland took charge of the necessary documents for both boys, knowing that Bill would soon drop his pretense as baggage handler and return to existing purely in Spirit Form. They&#39;d also have to return the uniform he had &#39;borrowed&#39; at some point, but that could wait until later.

Everything was proceeding smoothly. Passports checked, itinerary signed, until...

&#39;Sir, I&#39;m afraid that is unacceptable. Our luggage policy only allows for two extra suitcases per passenger. Anything beyond that would require alternative arrangements.&#39; The staff at the check-in kiosk informed Lachlan with a polite and firm voice, as she stared, mouth agape, at the towering stack of luggage behind Bill that were still waiting to be checked in.

Lachlan leaned against the kiosk with a nonchalant expression. &#39;I haven&#39;t heard anything like that,&#39; he said innocently, trying to charm his way out of the situation. &#39;Is there any way we can make an exception?&#39;

The staff shook her head. &#39;I&#39;m sorry, sir. We cannot compromise on our luggage policy.&#39;

&#39;But it&#39;s two extra <em>per person</em>, correct?&#39; The puppeteer persisted, pulling out his wallet. &#39;Suppose if I purchased the unused luggage space from all the ladies and gents on the flight? I&#39;m willing to pay the extra handling fees.&#39;

But the staff remained unmoved. &#39;I&#39;m afraid that I must decline, sir. Our policy applies to all passengers equally. This is a <em>commercial</em> flight, after all. However, we do have a cargo service that you can use for the excess baggage,&#39; she handed the redhead a brochure. &#39;You can send your extra luggage with one of the cargo flights. There may be a delay due to scheduling, but you will receive your items within a reasonable amount of time.&#39;

<strong>&#39;Stubborn old hag,&#39;</strong> Lachlan muttered vehemently, crinkling the boarding pass in his hand as he stormed out of the check-in area, leaving a string of complaints behind him as he barged through the crowd. He had thought he could at least reason with the check-in staff, but their refusal to budge had left him feeling more frustrated than ever.

He finally reached an empty bench and slammed his carry-on bag onto it, startling a few travelers out of their early morning stupor. 

By no means should he have gotten so riled up from a simple exchange. After all, he was only trying out an alternative approach, and the staff was just doing her job. Yet for some reason, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that there was something going on behind that unwavering, professional smile of hers.

Maybe it was the ungodly hour, or perhaps it was the fact that he had been up all night preparing for the trip, but he couldn&#39;t help but keep replaying the exchange in his head...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093156997064564837 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093156997064564837><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 7:55 AM">7:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was more than happy to follow suit, until he noticed Lachlan storm off with an expression of pure disgust. A scowl that he had seen all too many times, especially in the mirror.

<em>&quot;Bill, crush that guy&#39;s skull.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;He looked at me funny. Teach him a lesson.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;You in on this plan or what? We need an extra pair of arms.&quot;</em>
<em>&quot;Head to the Indian territory and tell your Cherokee squaws that we&#39;re coming.&quot;</em>

Archer was the type that liked having orders barked at him, and not just because he enjoyed the work: It made him look reliable. Being reliable allowed him to get away with a lot of things, such as avoiding silly gang disputes or being able to take temporary leave anytime he pleased. In the beginning, however, barely anyone was willing to give him orders, viewing him as a mad dog who could only howl.

Sometimes, orders needed to be earned. Some dogs were too dangerous to pet, after all.

&quot;Pardon me.&quot; He said, removing the luggage and gawking at the staff member. He asked a few questions, then walked past Roland to take a look at his Master. Lachlan was fuming, more irritated that he had ever been, which was saying something considering his reaction to Archie&#39;s death and the puppet massacre. Despite that, Bill didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass as he pressed his palm on Lachlan&#39;s shoulder to grab his attention, making the Dowling feel even more uncomfortable.

&quot;Ya doing alright? I thought you were above tantrums.&quot; Bill said with an almost taunting tone. &quot;Well, I asked around and...There might be a flight willing to take that extra baggage of yours.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Jesus fucking Christ, I&#39;m not throwing a tantrum!&#39; He snapped at Bill, much to the latter&#39;s confusion. Then, realizing that he was once again turning quite a few heads, did an excellent job of lowering his voice at the expense of Bill&#39;s cheap, stolen uniform: with a tight grip, he forcefully pulled him down by the collar until they were eye to eye.

&#39;Didn&#39;t you hear what she said?&#39; He hammered each word into Bill&#39;s skull with crystal clarity. &#39;Only cargo flights can do that.

He was forcibly dragged down to face Lachlan, the Dowling trying their best to maintain a low profile, yet already blowing it up by ranting about how terrible their day was, how humiliating it was to be delayed.

Bill&#39;s eyes narrowed in visible annoyance. &quot;I&#39;m not deaf, no. But maybe I should be.&quot; He scoffed, grabbing Lachlan&#39;s hand by the wrist. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it felt irritating nonetheless, as the cowboy lifted up the man&#39;s hand and shoved it aside.

&quot;Two weeks should be enough time to cool you off.&quot; Bill rose up, dusting himself off and looking at Lachlan right into the eye, as if he was completely willing to just leave him in that hopeless and pathetic scenario for what had happened earlier. &quot;I certainly don&#39;t mind hanging around and just...breathing in all of this.&quot; He motioned at the airport, and the worst part was that Lachlan could see him being 100% serious. Bill seemed overly curious about the new world, much more than he had expected from a Servant.

&quot;But,&quot; He paused, casting one last glance at his Master. &quot;if you&#39;re willing to listen, and to stop acting like some brat I&#39;d shoot behind a shed, then maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, those two weeks can turn into <em>two hours.</em>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095428241340256257 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095428241340256257><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 2:20 PM">2:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
An unrealistic proposal, especially for someone who had been on as many flights as Lachlan. Was Bill high? Did he simply misunderstand how modern human aircraft worked?

&quot;You said it was a cargo flight? Got it.&quot; Bill then pointed to a nearby board, its digital display showing a list of departures. One was marked for another American city, Gate 9A. It was planned to leave in thirty minutes.

&quot;That&#39;s the one. Let&#39;s go.&quot; He snapped his fingers and turned around, taking a few steps before he looked back.

A Servant&#39;s strength wasn&#39;t to be trifled with. If Bill ever found it in him to rebel against his Master and challenge his authority with mere words, then...

He massaged the back of his neck, where the Command Seals lay dormant across his skin. A constant reminder of his role in the Holy Grail War, and the metaphorical leash he held in his hand, keeping Bill in check.

&#39;In two weeks and you&#39;ll cease to exist,&#39; he bit back at the Archer. &#39;You entire existence is on a loan. The moment the War concludes, it&#39;s back to the throne with you. No more fast food. No more cars and planes. I don&#39;t know what the Throne is like, but it certainly speaks volumes that you enjoy the modern age as much as you do.&#39;

&#39;Unless, of course, we are the ones to obtain the Grail.&#39;

He squinted at the board, the urge to deride his Servant rising within him as he scanned the information of the flight Bill had been talking about.

&#39;I see your point, if barely. No offence, but it&#39;s <strong>shit</strong>.&#39;

He criticized the Archer, leaving little room to save his face. Clearly, the Dowling heir was unimpressed with whatever plan he believed that his Servant had concocted.

&#39;First of all, that&#39;s a domestic flight. Do you have any idea what that entails? Sooner or later, we&#39;ll need to catch a transfer. Out luggage will also need to be retrieved and rechecked. Without the proper procedures, we&#39;ll be stuck with the exact same issue we&#39;re facing now at the next terminal. Or worse, get blacklisted and be refused entry.&#39; 

He crossed his arms.

&#39;Unless we <em>don&#39;t</em> transfer. But hiring a flight at this hour...&#39; He checked his watch. &#39;The rate is going to kill me. I do have a budget, believe it or not.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095484870819590205 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095484870819590205><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 6:05 PM">6:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

No, he kept walking forward, putting up smiles and pumping up his chest as he used telepathy to its fullest.

<em>&lt;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be good at magic or something? What&#39;s the point in being a magus if you just keep fitting the mold like the rest of these rats?&gt;</em> He raised his arms, pointing at the massive crowd that had gathered inside the building. The entire airport was just one massive entity of changing flights and passerby. Lachlan was part of that organism as well.

<em>&lt;You&#39;re standing here, worrying about transfers, procedures and, heheheh-&gt;</em> Bill couldn&#39;t help but laugh. <em><strong>&lt;Blacklisting?</strong></em> <em>Boy, I&#39;m a criminal. Do I look like I care?&gt;</em>

The cowboy spun his spuds around, shaking his head and stifling a few giggles. <em>&lt;I&#39;m just saying, if you&#39;re really going to sweat it over the smallest things, then maybe you just don&#39;t have what it takes to have it all. You think I cared about crossing a few bridges when money was involved?&gt;</em> His tone turned from amused to curious, as if he was testing Lachlan&#39;s views.

<em>&lt;And I&#39;m supposed to obey you? Might as well kill myself right here.&gt;</em> He joked, giving him a lazy smile. One that looked amicable, yet deranged. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He threatened Bill openly despite the staggering difference in their strength, but with all three of his Command Seals intact, his words carried weight. He could impose the most ridiculous restrictions on Bill through the power of the Command Seals, and Bill would have no choice but to comply. 

Of course, it would be foolish to waste such a precious resource on petty matters. But if Bill continued to annoy him...

<em>&lt;Brawn doesn&#39;t talk like they&#39;re bloody smart,&gt;</em> he reminded Bill as he remained stoic, in contrast to his animated gesturing. <em>&lt;They act, they follow orders.

He sneered at Archer. Despite his words of &#39;encouragement&#39;, plain disbelief was written all over his face at Bill&#39;s bluster.

<em>&lt;The moment you slip up, the moment you fail to live up to your promise, however...&gt;</em> He reached back to touch the Command Sealed tattooed onto the back of his neck.

<em>&lt;I don&#39;t think you want to do that, boss.&gt;</em> Bill replied to Lachlan&#39;s threat to his fingers. <em>&lt;Ya need a good pair of hands for the war, dontcha? C&#39;mon, we&#39;re all friends here.&gt;</em> He giggled, trying to deescalate the situation. He could sense Lachlan&#39;s intent thanks to his connection as a Servant, feeling the pulsating energy of the seals on the boy&#39;s neck.

<em>&lt;And right you are. That&#39;s why my promises don&#39;t come lightly: I offer you a job well done, and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ll get!&gt;</em> He smiled back. <em>&lt;All I need from you is to get us past security. You&#39;re more than capable of that. Once we get on the flight, just follow my lead. Should be easy with this neat telepathy trick you Masters have.&gt;</em>

He turned around, adjusting his coat as he started heading towards departures. He looked back, wondering if Lachlan would follow through. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cowboy shrugged, not even attempting to protest with how hard his Master was glaring at him. <em>&lt;At least in a gang you get to support each other. Guess you&#39;ve never heard of that. Bah.&gt;</em> He scoffed, heading towards departures with Lachlan right behind him.

It was smooth sailing, up until a certain point of course. They got to baggage loading, with two members of staff staring at them with perplexed faces. It wasn&#39;t Bill or Lachlan that looked strange, but simply their baggage. One of the staff was already reaching for a flyer in their pocket, no doubt filled with important information such as baggage limits. 

Noticing that, Bill stepped forward. This was his time to shine, to show that Lachlan could have some faith in the cowboy&#39;s plans.

&quot;Just these bags, please.&quot; He casually shoved them forward in a tray.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is past our maximum limit for this flight. Do you have any tickets that include extra luggage, perhaps?&quot; A staff member replied.

&quot;Nope. But I&#39;m sure we can come to an agreement.&quot; Bill said with a smirk, putting a hand in his pockets and taking out a quick stack of hundred bills. He immediately placed it in the staff member&#39;s hand and closed the palm.

&quot;Sssh.&quot; He placed a finger on his lips and then remained silent, smiling absentmindedly as if he had just done a great job.

&quot;....&quot; The staff member looked dumbfounded, before they snapped out of their trance and shook their hand. &quot;Uh, no. Not me. You can buy an extra luggage voucher back at the help desk closer to the entrance. I&#39;m sorry, but until you purchase that, I can&#39;t put your baggage in.&quot;

Bill&#39;s smile immediately turned into a confused frown.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109222801782603828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109222801782603828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 3:55 PM">3:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;But I just paid you.&quot; He said.

&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to be the one paid? Sir, please just buy a voucher.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be damned...&quot; Bill shook his head in disappointed, then took a glance at Lachlan. No doubt his Master was fuming at how incompetent the Archer was, so there was only one way for him to fix this.

Thanks to Lachlan wanting to see Bill embarrass himself in real time, he was so focused on the cowboy&#39;s antics that he noticed that his Servant was gradually reaching for their pistol... <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His maneuvers fell far short of the scenarios in the movies: instead of pocketing the cash with a sly grin, the worker pulled out a flyer from his own pocket and began to educate the Archer on workplace regulations.

Behind them both, Lachlan visibly, and audibly, facepalmed. 

He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. Of course this wouldn&#39;t work. How could Bill have expected success from such a simplistic - even barbaric - approach? Humans had evolved a bit further since the past century to allow their brains to shut down at the first sight of money. There were far greater risks and consequences involved when it came to rule-breaking activities. Even if money held some sway, the meager sum Bill had procured was far from enough.

<em>&lt;Oh, how surprising, money isn&#39;t the golden ticket here.&gt;</em> Lachlan couldn&#39;t help but take a jab at Bill&#39;s shoddy performance. The Archer turned to look his way as he delivered his telepathic message, no doubt fuming at the insult. 

But even if Bill had choice words for his Master, time was running out. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, at risk of either losing face or being hauled off by security, the Archer only had a limited options to turn the situation around—

Lachlan&#39;s face blanched slightly as he saw Bill&#39;s hand inching towards his holstered guns. The glimmer of the metal peeked through the gap in his clothes. Rather than <em>being</em> the entertainment, it seemed that Bill was ready to create some entertainment for himself!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 6:20 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A hand swiftly grabbed Bill&#39;s own, firmly holding it in place. Roland wedged himself between the Servant and the staff, hiding the gun from view of the latter while denying the former any access to his concealed weapon. He put on his best confused expression, then stepped on Bill&#39;s foot discreetly while directing innocent glances towards the worker.

&#39;We, uh, we already have the vouchers,&#39; he did his best to act convincingly. &#39;That&#39;s precisely why we&#39;re here, to oversee your colleague and ensure our luggage gets on board the plane. My boss has them.&#39;

He turned around, casting a nervous glance at Lachlan. His heart skipped a beat as he noticed the darkened expression on the puppeteer&#39;s face.

He elbowed the blonde aside and reached into his pockets.

&#39;Why, I&#39;ve got it right here.&#39; He declared as he retrieved a fat stack of...fast food vouchers that had come with their recent food deliveries. Then he flaunted them one by one in front of the staff, as if they were blind.

Back in his day, people would take a bribe and not even bat an eye. Those that were foolish enough to say no just needed a bit of conditioning, usually with a gunshot or two. Which is exactly what Bill planned on doing, until Roland intervened in a timely manner and made up an excuse, talking something about vouchers.

&quot;Uh, right. Let&#39;s see it then.&quot; The staff, still confused at the attempted bribe, decided to just treat it as an unfunny prank. They handed Bill back the money and instead waited for Lachlan, who was taking out a stack of vouchers. Fast food vouchers, that is.

<em>&lt;Uh, boss. I don&#39;t think that will work.&gt;</em> Bill said, but to his surprise, the staff member grabbed the vouchers with a nonchalant face. To him, there was nothing odd or surprising about those tickets.

&quot;Right you are, sir. These vouchers work just fine.&quot; The staff said, scanning them and tossing them into the bin before motioning for Bill to carry on. &quot;You&#39;re in the clear. Have a nice flight!&quot;

A minute after that encounter, Bill turned back to Lachlan with a slight glare. <em>&lt;If you could have done that all along, why were you so pissed in the first place?&gt;</em> He asked, despite sounding pissed himself.

<em>&lt;I hypnotized the idiot, idiot. However, the effect will wear off after a while.

Lachlan explained with a hint of resignation. Nothing good seemed to last in this world, not even when it came to Magecraft. There were rules and limitations that one simply could not bypass. Bill was about to learn this the hard way, especially after the puppeteer employed the same trick to get through the boarding gate with several pieces of paper masquerading as their boarding passes...

&lt;See? What did I tell you?&gt; He shot Bill a message, clearly exasperated. &lt;Bribe one person, but you can&#39;t bribe them all. The same goes for hypnotism. Sooner or later, the gig will be up, and trying to cover your tracks in this day and age is far more challenging compared to the backwaters systems you had a century ago.&gt;

Even if he could bypass the security check via Magecraft, there was still the issue of the flight itself to contend with. Best case scenario, they would face a delay before taking off again. Worst case, however, the flight would be canceled, and they would have no choice but to deal with the fallout and search for an alternative flight. Not to mention clean up the aftermath of their luggage situation.

The thought of it all irritated him deeply. God, why was he surrounded by a sea of incompetence? Ultimately, it was the pilot and copilot who were in control of the flight. Which meant that all he had to do was to sway them to his cause...

Yes. Why not? It felt like a good idea, anyway.

&#39;This plane is not going to land,&#39; he spoke with sudden calm, in contrast with the grim implication of his words. &#39;We are turning it around.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110231500399583355 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110231500399583355><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 10:43 AM">10:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two were acutely aware of this fact, but one of them was not. <em>&lt;It won&#39;t? What the hell are you mages good for then?!&gt;</em> Bill immediately shifted the blame towards his would-be savior. <em>&lt;A billion years of studying magic, and you couldn&#39;t even mess with people&#39;s brains permanently? How nice.&gt;</em> He scoffed, shaking his head as they were now approaching boarding.

Lachlan ignored him, instead simply repeating the same trick and getting the trio past the boarding gates. They approached the flight itself and climbed it with no effort, before heading for any seats that had yet to be occupied. Hopefully they wouldn&#39;t have any cases of people coming to reclaim empty seats...

Thankfully, that didn&#39;t seem to be the case. Instead, they were treated to boring safety videos in case of a fatal plane accident, which Bill found ridiculous: Wouldn&#39;t they all have just died at that point? Bah. He did enjoy the fact that planes offered food and drink on board though, something that Lachlan immediately put a hard cap on by limiting him to only food item for the entire flight. Bummer.

That being said, everything seemed to be proceeding smoothly...until they heard the announcement. The gig was up, as the plane screen turned from their destination back to the name of the airport they had just came from. From one delay to an even worse one.

They had to get away. Right <em>now.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110651844281237594 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110651844281237594><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 2:33 PM">2:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...&quot; Bill remained silent, hearing the announcement and being bombarded by Lachlan&#39;s relentless chastising. He observed the plane&#39;s interior, noticing the windows, the doors, the toilet and the pilot&#39;s cabin. They were in midair, but direction had changed course, and he doubted it would change again after that announcement. But the gears in his head were already turning. An escape plan had been formed.

<em>&lt;Who said we had to cover our tracks back in the day?&gt;</em> Bill laughed. <em>&lt;You know what&#39;s so special about being an outlaw? We don&#39;t cover our tracks. We don&#39;t hide. We just...<strong>get away with it anyway.&gt;*</strong> He smirked, giving Lachlan a cheeky grin. Archer already knew what came next to the plan, but was surprised as his own Master reached the solution himself.

&quot;Good. Now you&#39;re thinking like a true outlaw.&quot; Bill replied in kind, giving a light clap of hands. He then pointed to the front of the plane, where a pair of hostesses had already started the verification procedure, checking for people&#39;s passports and boarding passes.

*&lt;I&#39;m gonna head there and slowly make my way to the pilot&#39;s cabin. You follow my lead, and I suggest you keep a good grip on that gun of yours.&gt;</em> He wagged his finger across the seat, giggling like a child looking forward to what came next.

<em>&lt;Alright. Here we go. Cover your ears.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110651877525295145 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110651877525295145><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 2:34 PM">2:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>BANG!</em>

A bullet pierced the plane&#39;s roof, not large or wide enough to cause any serious damage, but still noticeable enough to attract everybody&#39;s attention. A tiny hole could be seen, followed by a trail of smoke that led back to Bill&#39;s gun. The cowboy was standing tall and proud, a hand on his waist and the other up in the air, pointing to the sky with the tip of his pistol.

Once the crowd took a good look at him, they turned to statues. Pupils dilated and faces went pale. Hands gripped at their seats like claws as the outlaw took a few, quiet steps forward on the plane. They stared at him like deer in the headlights, their lips paused and ready to break out into screams, their legs pumping up like pistons with a desire to run away.

He knew this all to well. It was what always happened back in the day, be it on wagons or trains. There would be silence, then panic, then chaos. People went from 0 to 100 real quick once their lives were on the line. Therein lies the problem with a robbery: You can&#39;t let them get to 100. If you do, you lose control of the herd. People needed to be held like cattle.

<em>BANG!</em>

That&#39;s why he added a second one, just for good measure. It rattled their nerves and kept them still, giving him enough time to assert dominance.

&quot;Calm, everybody don&#39;t, HEY! Sit down,&quot; Bill motioned for an elderly man to avoid a pointless struggle. He then kept walking, clacking his spuds on the plane floor as he kept his gun raised, firm, and most importantly of all, visible.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110651925847867403 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110651925847867403><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 2:34 PM">2:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;My name is Cherokee Bill, and this, is a <em>robbery.&quot;</em> He declared, accentuating every word. &quot;Now, let it be known that I don&#39;t really enjoy violence. That being said, you are now in the company of a pretty violent-&quot; He was about to continue, before he eyed an interesting looking drink in the corner of a passenger seat. He swiped it away from a woman&#39;s hand and opened it with his teeth, before devouring the bottle&#39;s contents in one gulp. A tangy flavor hit the back of his throat.

&quot;Ahhh, that hit the spot. Mmmph.&quot; He grunted, wiping his lips off and dropping the empty bottle in someone else&#39;s hands. &quot;Bottom line is, don&#39;t do no stupid shit.&quot; He then stared ahead, watching the cabin crew remain petrified. One brave soul was reaching for what appeared to be an alarm, but froze once they saw Bill pointing their gun at them.

&quot;Ya really wanna do that? Really really?&quot; He taunted, waving the gun to the side. An easy way of telling them to go sit in the corner and think about their misdeeds. The hostess shamefully obliged.

&quot;Now. My dear ladies. Mind asking the pilots to come over here? I just want to talk, is all.&quot; Bill asked, demanding the hostesses to enter the pilot&#39;s cabin.

<em>&lt;Not too bad, right?&gt;</em> Bill looked back, staring at Lachlan. <em>&lt;You get up now and be my accomplice. Keep the passengers down while I deal with the pilots and we&#39;re out. Easy!&gt;</em> He relayed. It was a solid plan, especially when there was no one on board to contest a Servant&#39;s strength. Maybe even Lachlan could admit that his Archer had handled the situation well.

That was when the bathroom door opened. Someone had entered it before the announcement and were now making their way out. Bill immediately tilted his head, ready to have whatever unlucky passenger get back to their seat <em>immediately.</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
