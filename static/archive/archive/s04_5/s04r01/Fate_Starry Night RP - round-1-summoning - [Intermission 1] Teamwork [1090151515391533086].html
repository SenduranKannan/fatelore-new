She had humor Saber request of clothes and other stuff he may need as they traveled to Berenice. While they were still a day away from officially reaching the island she had asked Saber to keep an eye from any possible people spying on them.

In her eyes they needed to use their time as effective as they could, and for her that also meant taking care of any possible enemy as soon as they could before they could become a threat. 

From what she learned from Saber some servants abilities needed time and preparation. That was an issue most mages had as well so for Gloria hitting them early was the best course of action. 

&quot;You felt a servant around here?&quot; she asked him in a soft voice.  While they could talk through their mental connection she rather speak with whenever she could. &quot;Remember, I take care of the master and you of the servant whoever finish first helps the other side.&quot;

It was a simple yet quite optimal strategy for both of them. Neither was that much of a support skill wise so each just dealing with their enemy seemed the best choice at least on her eyes. She made a pause to give Saber the change to voice his though in the matter before they moved closer.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber is no different as he, like any other servant, can sense other servants in a fixed radius as long as they are concentrating on doing so, similar to an <em>active sonar</em>. Right now, Saber is acting like a <em>passive sonar</em> and is &quot;listening in&quot; for other servants to swiftly respond to any potential ambush attempts.

&quot;Nothing&quot;, Saber quickly replied. Saber has not detected the presence of another servant, yet. He can choose to actively seek them out but... &quot;Though, at this time, and wherever we are going, we&#39;re bound to come across someone of the like at least&quot;, Saber snorted with a short laughter. He appears to be lax, maybe even excited, about the idea of encountering a potential threat.

Saber feels more confident now he has his gear. A waist belt holding his sword on his back, and a more modern attire that retains his original color scheme. The sword is rather difficult for Saber to hide however. If anyone were to ask about it, Saber would be absolutely done for... if it weren&#39;t for his excuse of needing it for his field of work which he would say is to trim hedges and shrubs.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She still had some issue with Saber, his behavior was somewhat odd and while she could work with that she had concerns on how it could go when in an actual fight. Specially cause she couldn&#39;t really pinpoint his exact behavior, it was a mix of silliness and maybe even arrogance?? 

She just didn&#39;t knew him well enough which make this trip even more important. She needed to figure out how well they worked together in an actual fight. How much their values may differ from each other when it came to dealing with their enemies. It would be annoying if Saber were the type to want her to spare every single master. While she could consider it, it would heavily depend on how she perceived them as a threat. Winning once meant nothing really, as she learn more and more of this war just taking someone down doesnt mean the issues are over. 

The surviving master can just go and make another pact with another servant. While the chances of that are slim are not 0 and in that case she finds herself against a more powerful version of an enemy she could have dealt with before. 

&quot;Let me know as soon as you know anything&quot; she said as she guided Saber through alleys between building, avoiding large group of people not wanting to draw attention.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While neither of them could imagine the whole reasoning behind such actions the main purpose was quite obvious, a trap. 

Far away a couple of men would just stand waiting for their prey to come knocking. One was in a clad of armor, it was hard to pinpoint its origins but it looked quite from the medieval era, it was black and covered most of his body making him look more as a metal monster than an human. The other was just looking at the sky waiting for anyone to come. Arrogance was what fueled his actions, he believed his servant to be undefeated and so instead of searching for others he would just make it so they would come at them.  That is not to say they he wasn&#39;t prepared, he had his mystic codes and barriers around the are to be alarmed when enemies were to approach it. 

&quot;You think someone will come Rider?&quot; the man said, obviously annoyed at the wait. He expected people to come faster. 

&quot;Hard to know&quot; the black knight didn&#39;t said much. &quot;You should probably hide.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense&quot; 

Rider growled under his breath at his master foolishness, behind them was an abandoned building he honestly preferred if they were to just wait inside of it but his master didn&#39;t agree. He mention something about his pride as both a mage and as member of some family which the servant didn&#39;t bother to even remember. He was foolish, the man expected others to play by his own rules and little did he knew he would pay dearly for it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seems he has found <em>someone</em>, that someone being a fellow Servant. &quot;Threat detected&quot;, Saber said in a monotone voice.

Saber would normally use his judgement to decide what to do next upon sensing a threat, he would either ignore it and move on or dispatch it right away. He would be doing that right now but, due to circumstances, he has to be considerate for his someone, that being his Master.

&quot;Master, do you wish to engage?&quot; Saber asked, again with the monotone voice as if he is a machine. While waiting for a response, Saber is thinking of some ideas to get the most advantage before they commence their battle with another Master Servant pair. High ground, element of surprise, assessment of the area of battle, all of the big and little things.

Saber hovers around the hilt of his sword, with the intent of pulling it out and begin crossing swords with his potential opponent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sudden detection make it quite a fortunate timing so she couldn&#39;t avoid feeling suspicious at the same time it was also an issue of what else could happen when they were to engage. A one on one fight was one thing but if the other side had more numbers the situation can change. 

In fact the other side didn&#39;t even need to have allies, it could be someone else who also tries to engage with whoever is sending the signal. Just like Saber she was thinking ways in which they could get an advantage over the other side. 

&quot;Ughh...&quot; she said before steeling herself. &quot;Okay lets engage but keep an eye for other presences, if you feel that other servants are coming we will retreat. The same will be applied if you feel someone else coming while we are on our way we will take it easy as let both sides duke it out first.&quot; 

While she had obvious concern about what she was about to say she had a perfectly good reasons. &quot;I need you to carry me on your back on something in the case we dont feel anyone else in the way you are to let me go once we are close enough so I can sneak and face the master while you keep the servant busy. You carrying should help us avoid traps a bit as we will be moving as one and unless they have specialized skill we can be percieved as one as well.&quot;

She was slightly embarrassed but that was one of the good point of being so small it would be a waste to not try and use it. 

&quot;So lets go&quot; she said as she waited for Saber to either pick her up to for him to kneel so she could jump on his back.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In spite of Saber&#39;s figure, he is very much capable of carrying some weight on him. Well, it is mostly because he is a Servant so it should be only natural for him to be able to do so.

Since Gloria is on his shoulder, he cannot go full speed forwards otherwise it would be a rather unpleasant ride. Why he would do this is because... &quot;Spreading your legs to a stranger is indecent, I&#39;d say this is one way to retain modesty&quot;, Saber said with a mischievous smile.

Being unable to go forwards at full speed seems pretty bad. However, if it is vertical, it should not be a problem as long as the rider is holding tight. Saber does need some high ground and perhaps they&#39;d be less predictable if they encroached on the other Master&#39;s zone of control with some verticality... especially since they are in an alleyway.

&quot;Master, I&#39;d suggest you hold on tight. We&#39;re going up!&quot;

Saber made sure the sky is clear before performing this stunt. Then, he focused his energy into his legs before jumping onto the wall of the surrounding buildings. As soon as his foot touches the wall, he pushes himself to leap onto the other and back again until they reach the roof of the building.

&quot;Now, we can get a good look at where we&#39;re headed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Take me as close as you think you can, once you sense the enemy coming at us just let me down and each of us will take care of out target.&quot; 

Yes she needed to call them targets, she needed to not think as living beings as such unnecessary though could easily undo her at the most critical moment. Her mind went back to the situation at hand, they seemed to be leading into the outskirts of the town, which was perfect, there didn&#39;t seem to be much people around there so collateral damage was a low danger. But it also meant that the enemy could easily hide.  She would need to try and make the most of Saber distracting the enemy servant. 

&quot;Leave me at the closest of those buildings and after that try to make as much most noise as you can&quot; she said pointing at the abandoned houses that were in the direction they were moving.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sadly the same could not be said about his master. 

&quot;Be quick Rider, as my servant try your best to not disappoint me.&quot; he said as he prepared himself to enjoy an spectacle.  The master was clearly not worried about the possible enemy master, due to how his barrier was breached he assumed it was just a single target and made the assumption the master had sent his servant on his own which in his eyes make sense. 

After all, why risk one life when having someone else who could do it instead. 

Rider wanted to yell back at his master but more pressing matters were coming, his master was a distraction right now. His only concern being the enemy coming at him, yet he needed to make sure said enemy didn&#39;t took care of the distraction. From his feet a black shadow began to expand, covering the ground as if being a black goo. 

From it 5 horse like beasts began to slowly emerge as he materialize a long spear ready to take on Saber. The beast were all  black and would growl as they prepared for whoever their master told them to attack. Rider enhance all of his sense the moment he were to felt that Saber was coming he would give the order for his beasts to attack.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber swiftly traversed across buildings before dropping down and putting Gloria down where she wanted to be. Drawing his sword and ejecting his current clothing before fitting himself with his traditional attire, Saber prepared himself for battle.

Make as much noise as you can? Saber did not like how it was worded as it sounded like bringing the fight to <em>him</em> instead of bringing the fight to <em>them</em>. Though he would do exactly that, he would do it in a way that gives him the first move advantage. To be the one to strike first means to begin the fight on your turn. Once Saber starts his turn, all he has to do then is to put the enemy on the backfoot and initiate pressure to open them up.

&quot;Commencing battle&quot;, Saber declared as he prepared to engage with the enemy Servant. Launching himself into a dash, he attempts to set his plan in motion and initiate the fight on his turn. Reckless as it may seem, it will be all worth it as he would be on the offensive.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In her own way she was confident that Saber regardless of how he acted he wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to her. 

&#39;Win Saber&#39;  the swordsman would hear that through their mental link. As she moved through the buildings, she expected that it would take her a while to find the master of the enemy servant. As she expected him or she to be hiding somewhere in the many buildings of the area which was why she asked Saber to make noise so Rider would focus entirely on him. 

So imagine her surprise as she saw him just standing there as Rider prepared himself to engage Rider. It was akin to something too good to be true. Or maybe like she couldn&#39;t believe someone to be so reckless and even borderline stupid on his actions. 

As so as she heard the first sound of Saber clash with Rider she moved forward pulling her guns and shooting a fiery projectile at the man.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The beast stayed still, Rider was confident in his numbers as he was ready to use the other beast as sacrificial pawns to slowly weaken and finally kill their enemy. It was quite a logic strategy as regardless of how skilled one may be he can only attack at one enemy at a time. So when faced with attacks from multiple angles he had advantage. Soon he would see Saber dashing at him, he would move his hand and the beast would move to meet Saber at a certain spot, aiming to surround him. 

In Rider mind he was the one taking the initiative, but perhaps that wasn&#39;t really the case??

Regardless of the focus of his servant, the master was having a time of his life. Lucca was his name and while he understood to a degree that this was dangerous he couldn&#39;t help but smile as excitement washed over his body as he couldn&#39;t wait to witness the spectacle that was a fight between heroic spirits. 

Yet that excitement would be his downfall as all his attention was put on the incoming match, he didn&#39;t notice the fire projectiles coming at him till it was too late. He would be send flying into the empty house that he had refused to hide before as his body crashed into one of its dirty walls. 

&quot;Well that was uncalled for...&quot; he said as he dust the dirt out of his suit as the all the fire bullets seemed to have done to him was leave a black mark on his suit and face. &quot;There was no need for a sneak attack&quot;

His skin would turn purple, it seemed hard as rock but Gloria had no way of knowing it. &quot;Now why don&#39;t you come closer&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Putting all his speed and strength into one motion, Saber lunged at his opponent with his sword pointed backwards and held just above his ear to prepare for the strike. Saber believes this maneuver can cover his concerns which are his opponents range advantage and his opponents familiars.

Regardless of the reason, mages had been deemed quite the dangerous existence for the village.  That isn&#39;t to say that they would hunt every single mage who dared take a step inside their home but more like they were wary of them for obvious reasons. After all, for the Ignis clan their main goal was to keep the balance in the land. If a mage were to behave and dont do anything they really had no issues with them. 

It was a whole different story if they didn&#39;t they were wary due to the problems they could cause. They didn&#39;t knew of the many issues mage had caused in some old forgotten island or in some third world country village and they didn&#39;t need to. By the time Gloria learned of how fight her father and the elders of the village told stories of how in the past before Gloria was even born some mages had threaten the village. 

That mentality alongside her experience gave her a sort of edge. As she knew something, regardless of how strong they may be many shared a common weakness which was something which applied to not just them but also to many living beings. 

Mages weren&#39;t bulletproof, she knew that first hand which made the scene in front of her somewhat bizarre and confusing. She had waited for the best possible timing and her shot had strike true yet Lucca was somewhat fine. 

She didn&#39;t panic, she understood that his magecraft should had deal with the damage in some way which meant that there was trick to him surviving the strikes. To that she just needed to keep poking and looking for the opportunities.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lucca followed Gloria into the wrecked house, he enjoyed the feeling of the chase as the small woman run while shooting fire bullets at him. His skin remained a purple color as he either dodged or straight up tanked the multiple round shot at him. 

&quot;Come on lady, no need to run&quot; he said with a laugh. 

He would follow Gloria with a smile in his own mind unable to withstand the wait till he could just smash her into pieces and saw the despair in her eyes. Still she suddenly stopped and turn around, for Lucca it could only meant that she had given up but instead something changed. 

Instead of the regular round a fire beam was shot from the gun pushing him backwards as he began to yell in pain. His shoulder emitting the smell of burning flesh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He is completely exposed and he cannot change the direction he is taking. However! Saber is a Saber-class servant, they are recognized for their skill in swordsmanship and this Saber is no different. In truth, he is not exposed and he has no need to change his trajectory. And so, in a maneuver that only a Saber-class servant can pull off...

&quot;Predictable!&quot; Saber exclaimed as he swung his blade to parry his opponent&#39;s spear. The motion that he uses for this however, is quite clever and is something only a truly dedicated melee fighter can pull off: a <em>deflective parry</em>. In simple terms, it is a motion that stops the incoming strike while maintaining momentum to launch a counterattack at the same time.

Swinging his sword around his head, Saber unleashes his counterattack, that being a strike aimed for the neck. Saber plans to end this fight as soon as possible, that way he can support his Master in her own fight... he hopes she is doing well.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Crimson flames would sprout from her hands and slowly enter her guns as she kept her distance. While it gave her enemy a chance to recover it also give her time to plan her next move. 

Through their small mouse and cat chase, she had been changing between regular ammo and fire magecraft based projectiles. She found both to were not effective, but that wasn&#39;t that much of an issue the main issue was why and how? After each shot she would look back at where the projectile had hit him, marks appeared. So it was logical to assume he had been hit, so whatever his magecraft was it didn&#39;t deny her attacks it just allowed him to withstand them. 

A more simple comparison it would as if her opponent was wearing some sort of special anti bullets armors, but the issue with those was that even the highest quality ones stopping the bullet was relative easy but the energy generated by the impact was something different. Each strike had some effect on Lucca even if he himself didn&#39;t notice. Each round was slowly taking the edge of his protection. 

Another way to deal with those was to just user higher firepower, everything had a limit. She lift her guns and as the X on their sides began to be filled by a crimson color she prepare to pull the trigger. 

&quot;Wonder how many bullets will be needed to finish this&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While not to fully, Gloria had somewhat figured what his magecraft did. A more stronger version of the regular reinforcement regular magus making his skin almost as hard as steel.

Due to his great mana pool he was able to use without issues turning it on and off depending on the situation. But he really hasn&#39;t tested the limits of it specially with guns, after there were few magi who used them. 

&quot;You little...&quot; he said as he started to stand up ready to jump at Gloria as she pulled the trigger. His shoulder ache but he manage to lift his arms in defense in time to catch the bullet aimed at him. While he was arrogant and confident he was not an idiot. He knew that his burned shoulder was a weak spot which could easily be exploited. His armor was dented yes but not broken he moved forward protecting his face as he reached for Gloria and tackle her into the floor. 

On Rider side, the warrior had mixed feelings on one part seeing Saber skillful reaction to his thrust was something which as fellow warrior only warrant his respect and praise but also though it was annoying, unable to decide if this counted as good or bad luck.

&quot;Wonderful&quot; he said as the he moves his head to the side aiming to dodge the strike coming from the swordsman. But his reaction was to slow, a full dodge completely impossible with such a lighting move his helmet would be send flying and fall all behind. Rider could tell that the serious intent on Saber sword. 

He himself was force to take a step back, while moving his neck has kept his head attached to his body and reduce the impact it was still a powerful blow he had received.  As took a step back on his horse he let out a whistle as the other beast jumped in a desperate attack on Saber.

The opportunity to resume the offensive is present however Saber has to deal with the familiars first as he is in recovery. How he must do it must be time efficient to take advantage of the opponent&#39;s recovery state, the only optimal move Saber can theoretically take is to skillfully weave through the beasts.

Leaving the beasts alone would mean taking a gamble, as they may become a major annoyance if Saber does not finish the fight fast. If taking this gamble means keeping his turn, then it&#39;ll be all worth it as long as Saber faithfully practices the fundamentals of conducting an attack. However...

Saber pulls his blade out of the ground before pushing forwards towards the enemy Servant. Instead of weaving through the familiars though, he decided to cut down those in front of him while using his forward momentum to continue on his path to the enemy. It is not exactly the best move in this situation, however it allows him to address the problem early on while retaining the advantage at the end but with only tight window to resume his attack.

Worrying about being optimal can only bring unnecessary hesitation which can cost time and opportunity, to make only best moves can only be achieved in a perfectly controlled environment and a fight like this is definitely not completely controlled by any party at all. What truly matters is if the response fulfills the intent of the person in question... and the intent of Saber is to retain advantage and resume his attack as fast as possible!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As if being a mad warrior lacking any sort of common sense Saber was not paying attention to any of that and was just focused on him. As reckless as it was it could be seen as best decision for the current situation, which his reach and numbers pressing forward may appear as suicide but while doing it it limit Rider actions as whenever it was planned or not it kept forcing him into a one vs one. 

His strategy and formation destroyed as Saber rushed towards him slicing him familiar as if they were nothing but an annoyance as he only remained focused on Rider. I that position and situation Rider was forced to abandon any semblance of a plan. With no time to think nor plan he charged forward ready to meet Saber as he unleashed a rain of thrust. Aiming to return the favor, to push the swordsman skill to the limit with a flurry of strikes limiting his movements and taking away the opportunity to think or do anything. 

That being said even if his course of action seemed to be the best Rider hated it. Instinct and experience was all he could rely right now, and as his spear meet Saber&#39;s katana no one could even attempt to predict what would happen. 

Lucca was breathing heavy, pain made his body ache still he allowed a few seconds of relaxation. He had the girl pinned, even as he rushed at her she didnt stopped shooting at him. Still it was his win, his armor resisted and so she was now at his mercy. He raised his arms ready to beat her up, yes this was what she deserved for daring to hurt him and humiliate him in such way. 

&quot;Apu!!&quot; he heard her yell but it didn&#39;t matter he would smash her in the chest except instead of feeling her body crushing under his fist he body felt just as hard a steel.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were times where she wished she could have some sort of special talent, like some other members of the clan able to shape flames in ways which looked more like they were ruling over fire. But while she longed for those abilities she knew it was pointless to ask and wish for what she could never obtain. So she focus on what she could do, which meant using tools to make up for what she may lack. 

One of such tools was the cape she wore about her body, in order to make up for her human body she had a cape able to harden itself as if being made of steel. She could still feel the blows through the cape, just like Lucca&#39;s armor didn&#39;t offset impact the same was true for her mystic code. She gasped in pain but at the very least she was avoiding any lethal wounds, as if it werent for her cape her chest would probably have a big hole in it. 

Still the sudden resistance also worked as a distraction, Lucca stopped for a few seconds as she move her arm aiming to hit him with one of her arms. Still her arms were somewhat short so it would never reach him in any meaningful way. That was okay, she was counting on that as it was exactly because of that that he wouldn&#39;t see it coming. 

Lucca grabbed her arm aiming to crush it alongside the last of her resistance only to feel a sharp pain on his arm. A crimson blade would sprout from its forearm burning it from the inside out he would look at his arm as he yelled in pain seeing how the blade formed from a side of the gun. 

&quot;Bang&quot; Gloria said as used her remaining arm and while aiming at the chest of the magus shoot a fire beam which at such close range covered most of his upper body.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It seems like Saber would be turned into Swiss cheese but one must not forget the instinct of a great warrior of their time.

Saber swung his sword to meet with the Servant&#39;s spear, engaging in a clash. Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank. The sharp and repeated sound of striking metal fills the area. Saber has not realized it yet, but he is actually continuing the exact same flow he was in versus the familiars. The muscles in his arms have not left the thought of paving a way to the enemy, thus it naturally began deflecting the opponent&#39;s strikes to allow Saber to close in further.

With great elegance, all of Saber&#39;s attacks naturally flowed into each other to make a grand performance with the sword.

In truth that was the secret  as each successful parry delayed the next strike. As fast as he was he can only do one thrust at a time, aiming to overpower the enemy with the speed and chipping at his stamina. 

Still Saber skill and endurance was rejecting this concept as Rider was finally push back alongside his last familiar, he hadn&#39;t retreated but being blow away by Saber power and skill. His horse rise aiming to hit Saber with its front hooves as Rider prepared in the meantime. Darkness surrounded him, he was preparing to unleash something. His armor glow an ebony color as  he jumped out of the back of his last familiar and was ready to plunge over Saber face. Mana was burning his strenght and speed suddenly increased the that ebony aura covered his body.

 Rider was abandoning tactics, Saber had showing over and over that at this point his skill was enough to deal with any plan Rider was able to come and so it leave him with only one option. Try to close the gap in skill through sheer strenght. 

It was a gamble but that was the only thing he could do right now, besides unleashing his noble phantasm but he was concerned in doing so. Who knew who he was watching while he fought, for someone like Rider who liked to plan showing all his hand on the first fight was something akin to betraying his own nature. 

&quot;Got You!!&quot; he yelled as he pushed the spear downwards aiming for Saber head.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She dragged herself away from Lucca as she slowly used a wall to stand up, still this hasn&#39;t go as she had expected. She had gotten lucky to a degree with her opponent arrogance and abilities, but that was part of the course with her. As weak people need to fight smart, but also use whatever chance they can get as no matter how much one tries and plans it will rarely go as one expects. 

As she prepared to go she could hear the body of her target moving, her eyes widen as she looked at him. 

&quot;W...wait...&quot; Lucca said as he intended to stand up and move. The last blast had burned part of his face and chest. She had leaved a big dent on his so called armor and right now he would be in a lot of pain but were he to just lay there he could survive. Still now Gloria had to finish it, she had no other choice regardless of Saber winning or losing. A master is a danger regardless, there was no upside of letting him live and him being alive, someone who knew her way of fighting and her abilities to a degree, only danger. 

But even so, did she really had any right to kill him? She knew nothing of the man, in theory his wish could be just as just as hers. As Lucca rolled over to be on his belly and trying to stand up Gloria found herself doubting to press the trigger. 

&quot;I...I...I...Will..&quot; Anger could be hear in Lucca&#39;s voice. It was no suprise, anyone could tell he wanted Gloria death. 

<em>bang</em>

The sound of a gun being fired could be heard and then silence. She pulled the trigger again and again even though she knew he wouldn&#39;t get up till she run out of regular bullet. She looked at what she had done and bit her lip. 

&quot;Is okay... is okay... this is not for me....&quot; she said as she shoot a fire bullet making Lucca&#39;s body caugh on fire as she began to walk away. &quot;all is... for that child to have a future... that is all that matter&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was not Saber&#39;s intent to blow Rider away and now, due to the distance created, it is no one&#39;s turn and neither one of them has an advantage. With a steadfast stance, gripping his sword tight, Saber looked around for his opponent.

It was not long until Rider returned to Saber&#39;s sight. The metal monster&#39;s heavy steps and roaring voice is what caught his attention. Looks like someone&#39;s lost their composure, a highly committal attack done without precaution yells frustration... it does not help that, because of the state of the fight, it can easily be telegraphed too.

&quot;It&#39;s over.&quot; Without flinching, Saber stepped to the side and holding his hand out to grip Rider by the neck. Saber&#39;s natural strength coupled with Rider&#39;s momentum makes for a brutal combination, potentially crushing Rider&#39;s windpipe due to Saber&#39;s grip and their own weight and inertia. In spite of his looks, it turns out Saber isn&#39;t exactly lacking in the strength department.

It was not long until Rider was down on the ground as Saber swept him off his feet. Using the rotation of his maneuver, Saber stomped on Rider&#39;s back with great force generated by rotation and his own power. He didn&#39;t get to take his head, but this is better than wasting too much time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She saw him in action and how he easily seemed to take him down. Was he dead? She wanted to think he was but it was hard to tell with what Saber had told her about how durable a servant may be. 

Gloria herself wasn&#39;t aware but her eyes looked dead, tired as if her mind was trying to forget what she had just done. While she didn&#39;t regret killing Lucca, after all it was either his lifer or hers, but she regretted that it was the only way for her to achieve her wish. But it was too late to worry.

&quot;You done as well?&quot; she said in a tired voice as she looked at Rider body. It was weird shouldn&#39;t he be slowly disappearing as well? Even if it wasn&#39;t totally death his master died as well and so she wonder if this enemy was still a menace. 

She pulled one of her guns and began shooting at Rider body as it lay down. One of the fire projectiles hitting the body a bit close to Saber foot on its back.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;s in shock after seeing how Gloria looks, she&#39;s definitely been through a whole lot more than he did.

He was going to say something but held it in as it was pretty obvious from the looks of it. Saber shook his head and took his feet off the defeated Servant before dusting himself off. Inhale... and then exhale, taking in the atmosphere of what was once a battleground to clear his mind.

&quot;Master&quot;, Saber called out to Gloria in a stern voice in an attempt to pull her together. &quot;I&#39;d suggest you take a breather, just take in the moonlight for a bit.&quot;

He can&#39;t exactly communicate with Gloria when she&#39;s still lost in her thoughts like that. However counterintuitive it may be though, it is worth a shot. Saber might need to watch his language lest he ends up the next one being shot.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The servant didn&#39;t react in any way besides a flinch. So it was fair to assume he was down for real, just as the though entered her mind Rider body would began to dissolve into dust. It gave her some new perspective about what Servants were. Unlike his master Rider didn&#39;t left anything behind, his existence disappeared so easily and without  anyone even noticing that he was no different from a ghost. 

&quot;Lets go Saber&quot; she just said paying him no mind to his words. It was not due to disrespect but more like she was tired right now. She just wanted to lay down and rest before continuing. &quot;Oh right good work today.&quot;

It was the least she could say to the swordsman, he had fulfilled his mission without a single issue so praise was just par with the course. She began to walk away, regardless of her issues even if Saber was not human having him on her side did reassure her. It was nice knowing she didn&#39;t have to do this alone. 

They rapidly leaved the area, no one would discover Lucca body, or what remained of it for a while. It was an abandoned part of the city after all and with all the others deaths and chaos that would ensure in the following days most people had bigger worries. But even in this case just like the memory of the other people she had killed, Lucca would remain in her memory forever.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
