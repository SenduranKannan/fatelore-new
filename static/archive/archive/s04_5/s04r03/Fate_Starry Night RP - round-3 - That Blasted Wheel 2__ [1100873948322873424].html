He would love to find a map of the city to visit a bit, but at this time of night he was unfortunately not going to find much. Perhaps he could turn to crime to get a map quickly and do what he had to do. Boredom was at its peak, why even now was he alone and recognised by people? It was the people&#39;s fault, was it so hard for them to kowtow to the God Herostratus? Surely it was, but the Berserker didn&#39;t like it. This cold and lonely night reinforced the servant&#39;s idea a little more, he needed the Grail at all costs, he had to become the greatest of heroes to rule the world like a movie actor or a multimillionaire. As he walked along, he finally came to a slightly wider street, which must have been a main artery of the city. Yet even this avenue was empty at this hour. He stopped in the middle of the street and looked into the void with a disappointed look, coming to mutter with some annoyance</strong></em>

-Why did I have to meet such a hateful Master.

<em><strong>The more he thought about it, the more he felt like just unleashing on the city, he tried to keep himself calm by thinking about what he could do with the Grail, what he could become, but this subterfuge was unfortunately not going to last very long.</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hundreds of them flickered like sparks as they roamed the streets of Benerice. They had become part of the charm for the island city. Nobody knew where they came from. They had shown up one day, years ago, and nobody questioned them. Even now, they sat on bushes and on the sides of streets as Berserker lumbered past.

Illyn never took much care about how they impacted the local ecosystem. He didn&#39;t care much for the living, but ■■■■■ had. She had cried and bemoaned the damage the fireflies would cause back when she was alive. The fact that they didn&#39;t tear through all the greenery in Benerice like a swarm of locusts was her doing. 

Nonetheless, those lights they made? They made him feel something. A warm little <em>tingle</em>. He wasn&#39;t exactly sure what that feeling was. 

The car was parked a block away. All Illyn had to do was follow the lights, with Rider in tow. In his hand was a staff. With a deft motion, he leaned the staff into the crook of his arm.

&quot;<strong>Do you sense him, Rider?</strong> Illyn murmured quietly as they leaned in an alleyway next to the primary artery that Berserker was walking through. Illyn was covered in shadows that occasionally lessened due to the blinking of fireflies.

When Illyn had slowed down, Kalki sped up, moving past him as his master questioned if he too could sense it now. Of course he could. The pressure of mana in an area was enough to alert anyone that had eyes that there was something that was there be it a leyline, a servant, even the grail. 

Taking a few steps forward, he could at least see a figure that the pests had begun to swarm around, like a bunch of flies to a rotten apple. Ah, so could that have been what they were looking for? In his spiritual form, Kalki let out a small chuckle, curious as to why he could have been by himself. 

‘If this is who you are referring to Master, I feel bad for them. . . Do you think the other is nearby? If so, I suggest you go and deal with them. I’ll deal with this friend on my own.’

The Rider’s words were confident, like a general that had once led the prophetic army that he was meant to be. Of course he knew Illyn likely would have known such, but he felt it best to be safe than sorry. . . And for all he knew, if this berserker had come to be a bit of a problem, killing off the partner would have been a lot easier then. They’d cut the soldier from his general, and soon enough, the entire army would fall and vice versa. Besides that, Kalki trudges forward, his figure slowly becoming more apparent to the enemy servant. He was no assassin, and to fight with tactics felt useless to him anyways.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101994152872398898 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101994152872398898><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 5:11 PM">5:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Ah, I see they’ve found you, good friend.

I think it is time for us to have a little match. Apologies on my end, but ‘tis my Master’s order to win this war.”

He spoke with such a jovial tone that it could have been inferred that he had been amused by such, and yet even as his eyes were slightly closed, it could be discerned easily that he had a familiar sort of killing intent. The rider’s hand went up, and soon a blade had been conjured, its hilt decorated with various jewels, and the blade a sharp silver.

“I hope you can forgive me for this. . . But I assure you, I’ll have everything secured within the next cycle.”

The man’s final comment was followed by a thrust, something as simple as that, but with how he aimed he went straight for the man’s chest, ready to pierce through him if the servant was not prepared for such.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101994484750880799 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101994484750880799><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 5:12 PM">5:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="rubyrose9160">@Ruby Rose</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fireflies even began to fly around the servant, who was not paying any attention. Seeing and hearing the stranger approaching him, Herostratus finally understood that this swarm of fireflies circling him was not something ordinary. Only partially listening to his future opponent, whom he did not even consider to be a person of interest, Herostratus raised his arm and clenched his fist, making the fireflies surrounding him suddenly disappear in a spray of flames. His opponent seemed to have just finished his long monologue of apology. He must really be a coward to apologize for attacking, like a king apologizing for slaughtering an entire city before doing so without mercy. Worse than cowardly, it was perfectly hypocritical. In any case, Herostratus was unmoved by his new opponent&#39;s sword strike, and the latter leapt backwards to escape the weapon&#39;s reach. He then laughed, like a proud and arrogant emperor, before taking his turn to address the long tirade that Rider had uttered before attacking</strong></em>

-If your moves are as hypocritical as your words, then I have nothing to worry about. I am the great Herostratus, and you are embarrassing me, you piece of trash. 

<em><strong>The surface of Herostratus&#39; body suddenly began to glow slightly, as if a luminous God was appearing before Rider. In reality, it was nothing of the sort, Herostratus was only playing with his power of flame to make himself brighter in the midst of this darkness.

I will take a look. Don&#39;t concern yourself with the Master, assuming he&#39;s even close.&quot; Illyn said as he slunk into darkness. 

Illyn marched off into the shadows, lurking in the darkness behind buildings as he made his way around the street where Kalki would fight. This would not be a silent and confined fight. If Servants were truly powerful, they could atomize the block. Especially as, Kalki claimed, such a fight included the avatar of a god.

The staff made a metal clinking sound as it stuck the stone pathway. With a deft motion, Illyn began to climb a fire escape latched onto a sandwich shop. His breathing was slightly labored as he reached the top of the ladder, and stood atop the building, enveloped in darkness. He was a good distance away from Rider, yet still under the cover of darkness. An ideal location.

It would be better, actually, to break into a building and stand at the window. That could wake people, and then Illyn would have to kill them. Their screams could attract this Servant&#39;s Master. This was ideal. 

<em>I&#39;ve detected nobody, Rider. Your assessment on the Servant?</em>

Illyn could faintly see the duo preparing to dance, yet he could not make out any distinguishing features. The price of distance.

Krishna had been an emotional and often the more empathetic one, surely he would have made a slight explanation towards why he truly meant what he said. Kalki however, did not feel he needed to elaborate any further on it, he’d see what he meant later if anything. Illyn’s confirmation of there not being a master was somewhat comforting. Good, his master would be away from the wreckage of the battle, something that seemed best for now anyways. He kept it as a mental note to himself. 

His first thrust of his sword had hit nothing but air, the servant having enough time to jump back and announce his opinion quite harshly. The way he spoke was similar to how Agni breathed his flame, and how Surya had directed his army, hot, smolten. His command was a fiery pit that burned away doubt. And to even build the connection, to his command fire had gone and incinerated each bug that pestered him, a live bonfire that the incarnation had witnessed.

“Ah sorry sorry, I tend to test to see if at least I am correct on my hunches, the fireflies went towards you so clearly you’ve got to be a servant, no? And while I can’t say I do not find this attitude charming to your enemies, I do not believe we have a <em>Herostatus</em> in my homeland, so great may be a misstatement.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103078345769504820 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103078345769504820><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 2, 2023 4:59 PM">4:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Kalki gave it a moment, raising a brow before Herostratus could give a response. . . or well, display himself.

Maybe one of the forge. Someone under the tutelage of one? Kalki readied his sword again, this time his once lax grip tightened. 

“Yeah, its of great value actually. . . You’ll see once you have been sliced in two.”

Another movement towards the heroic spirit. Kalki tried closing the gap as best he could, his sword at his side before he swung the hand holding it towards the servant’s chest, aiming for a slash. And to put a mockery of the flaming man before him, Kalki’s own sword burst into flame, the mana around them becoming thin as it seemed the blade began to use it as a sort of fuel, absorbing it and expelling the heat around it. Herostratus had to be quick, for had he lingered too long he’d find out what exactly the value of his blade truly was.

What a bore. The Berserker reassured himself that the man in front of him possessed a form of Divinity (so I&#39;ve been told), which meant that this was another overconfident god or demi-god, like Artemis. He had burnt the temple of Artemis to the ground, so doing the same to another divine being would be a piece of cake. Herostratus knew of his opponent&#39;s divine origin thanks to one of his skills, a skill that increases his strength against this type of opponent, like a desire to be just as arrogant as the gods. Herostratus laughs slightly when he hears his opponent say that he has never heard of him, and he replies arrogantly, not caring about Rider&#39;s other words.

-Your country must be inhabited by retards not to know the name of a God.

No sooner had he finished his sentence than his opponent charged at him. The latter had confirmed the rarity of his weapon. Once again, the Rider sought to pierce Herostratus in the chest, but this time his sword had begun to emanate flames. In response to the small blazes that the sword can produce, Herostratus sets both arms ablaze, like torches in the night, ready to fall on the enemy.</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103466700034281512 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103466700034281512><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 6:42 PM">6:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>Rider&#39;s sword finally reaches Berserker&#39;s reach and just as he thought he had succeeded in his attack, Rider sees his opponent reach out and grab him by the hand.

Rider&#39;s blade was slightly embedded in Herostratus&#39; torso, but Herostratus held his opponent firmly with his flaming arm, which must surely be very uncomfortable for Rider&#39;s hand. At least the latter could take comfort in the fact that the Berserker must surely suffer just as much with the blade burning in his chest. At least, that was true until Rider&#39;s and Berserker&#39;s eyes met intensely and Berserker grinned like a madman as he said.</strong></em>

-I hope you really care about your sword! Because I&#39;m going to burn it to the ground! Flames of Fame! 

<em><strong>As would any fighter who was not conscientious and had no desire to hide his name, Herostratus had just activated his Noble Phantasm on Rider&#39;s sword (It was said that the staff will decide the actual power of the Noble Phantasm on a case by case basis). The sword suddenly flares up much more than usual and sets Rider&#39;s hand ablaze with it. Herostratus quickly raised his leg to try and push his opponent and his sword away from his wrist. Thus, Rider would have to decide between burning his arm and abandoning his weapon.

When he felt something try to grip onto his hand, he couldn’t help but feel disappointment. This man couldn’t have made the battle fun even if he had a balloon and colorful holi powder on his face. The Rider wanted to cringe at it. 

The grip Herostratus had on Kalki was a good one, something similar to how a fish would hold a piece of bait, and while he knew he was in a pretty big pickle, he felt it was nothing that would be too tricky to get out of. The heat from the man’s hands, immediately rose up, his skin feeling a searing feeling he had yet to comprehend. The announcement of Flames of Fame was enough to know whatever it would be wouldn’t be good, and luckily right when his hands began to slowly sear, the man had rose a leg ready to plant a nice foot square against Herostratus’ chest! 

The impact would feel like a freight train going square into him, once a feeble grip almost deathly kick ready to send him flying, it would have been entirely unexpected. Where could this strength have come from? A conviction? An Ability? For poor Herostratus, had he not been prepared to take it it’d feel as if a rib would have been cracked, maybe even two! 

As for Kalki, the wounds on his hands stayed there, yet the servant seemed easily aware of what would happen next. The clock would be ticking now. 

<em>”Ah, Master, it seems the time has begun. Watch how I demonstrate to you the world around us.”</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103847527641514087 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103847527641514087><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 4, 2023 7:55 PM">7:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The servant’s jovial thoughts felt out of place, almost relaxed in knowing what he said would happen. Kalki looked at his wrists, how he could see slight charring on them thanks to the berserker’s flame, skin flayed and frayed at certain parts, surely a 2nd degree burn at best. So that is where it would start. 

As for Herostratus, the sting of a kick if he had taken it either full force or not would have not gone unnoticed. The pain would be a dull throb, almost like a repetitive knock at the door. The servant prepared himself, waiting for the man to get up and ready.

Try to be subtle.</em> Illyn&#39;s thoughts filled Rider&#39;s head as he battled against Berserker. His tone had not changed since the fight began, but by this point, that was to be expected. He simply did not react to anything.

Rider had taken a wound from Berserker as the duo flailed about. If Berserker&#39;s Master intervened and tried to heal it, Illyn would know. It was best to not take such a chance. Rider&#39;s power was also a mystery. As an avatar, he was likely to be very impressive on the battlefield. Yet in the end, he was an unknown variable that Illyn was taking for a test drive.

His Servant burned, and Illyn watched on.

Several fireflies swirled around Illyn, before flying off in different directions. The commands were simple: <em>find the Master</em>.

Assuming they were here. Berserker running down a vacant street was not a particularly good strategy. Why stay physical when a spiritual form would save much more magical energy? It was strange. That oddity had an explanation, if Illyn could find it. It was his job to make Rider&#39;s life on the battlefield as convenient as possible.

Even if, in the end, Kalki was simply a tool. A weapon. The Holy Grail was simply a tool. A weapon. His mind wandered to that meeting at the Church...

<em>&#39;Tell me, Mr. Mariston, have you ever had a dream?&#39;</em>

That child. Why was he coming to mind now? Blast.

Nevertheless, the servant had been forced to flinch at the blow his opponent had dealt him in the stomach. Yet his knee never touched the ground. Herostratus almost did, and suddenly contracted his body as if to avoid putting a knee to the ground at all costs. A true beast of pride, even flinching seemed impossible against an opponent. Herostratus was going to have to force his opponent to get angry, unfortunately, this did not seem to be an easy task but the idea of hearing a voice full of rage pronounce his name calmed his mind surprisingly well. Back in the game, Herostratus could only recognise the danger in this opponent, but he had crippled him with one hand so it should be fine even for him who was not a fighter, just a clever bastard. Berserker then comes and spreads his two arms, as if he were imitating Jesus or some idol. He starts to walk straight towards his opponent, walking rather calmly. Suddenly, flames shoot out of his arms and crash down on both sides of the street, causing the buildings to burn. After walking a few metres and setting the buildings on fire, Herostratus drops his arms again and starts running towards his opponent, who now had no sword. Once within range of Rider, he brings his arm down, engulfing everything in the path of his arm in flames, like a curtain capable of burning. Yet Herostratus&#39; attack lacked distance slightly, it was too short to reach Rider, perhaps it was due to his cruel lack of combat experience. This answer might have seemed logical, at least until Rider saw the Berserker&#39;s body emerge from the curtain of flames with its legs raised and aimed directly at the testicles. Herostratus was not a warrior, but this he knew would hurt even the best of them, even if he didn&#39;t know if his attack would actually hit his two round targets.</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This bastard was a tough one, hearty didn’t even begin to cover the berserker’s endurance, even though he now knew that now the man he faced was likely some monster with it, he could liken him maybe to one of the many Kali who had dared fight his godly selves before. 

Kalki tried holding his blade, his grip tightening once again as much as it could, though he knew his skill was beginning to turn into its first full stage. The burn on his wrists deepened, its heat causing blistering with round yellow boils of pus. Ah. . . Treta Yuga, the Third Cycle. It began. For the Rider, he could feel his nerves sizzle with a jittery excitement, likely no thanks to Herostratus’ abiliies, meanwhile, the berserker too would feel something that would shake him for a moment. The crack on his rib crew into size, a fracture at best, some of the rib splintering in a hairline fashion. To Herostratus, this would have been unprecedented. Earlier he could feel that the punch while not knee bending worthy could likely become much more worse than he anticipated, was it a miscalculation? A misstep? He’d have to guess no longer. 

In his messiah-like mayhem, flames begin to surround the group, the heat burning away at the area as if it were to cauterize the land, razing things that were flammable to the ground including the beautiful greenery that was once admired by the preserving Rider. The heat could easily have taken down those who were not servants, but for the Rider, it was a matter of trying to force himself to withstand it. Even has his burn had been agitated, his wrist a slightly shaky mess, Kalki stood with a confident and proud smirk on his face. Alrighty, show-off, bring it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105314223548018789 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105314223548018789><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 8, 2023 9:04 PM">9:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The curtain of flame rushing towards him was one thing, but what happened next was a whole different story. Before Herostratus could get his hand thrusted out, a body crashed into him, the speed akin to a car going full speed, it couldn’t have been Kalki, especially since had he not been hit by such, he could have seen how the servant dealt with his hand being partially wounded, but what was it? The crushing feeling got worse, and soon, a force strong enough to blow him back came into play in an attempt to push him into the nearest building behind him. When it would have been done, a gust of heavy wind would have followed, enough to warrant him to need to check it out and see what the hell that could have been. Another servant? A spell? How in the hell did something interrupt his attack so quicky! So . . . strongly! A neigh would cut through his thoughts had he had any. It was something. . . and yet, with how the flames seemed to burn away, and the fire around it seem to only grow to hide its appearance, it was hard to make sure, but surely that sound had to have been a horse of some sort. 

The rider gave a small chuckle trying to pay the enemy servant no heed as he said something to the air, his voice a mixture between a joke and hidden pain. 

“Ah, my friend you’ve come to save me in a time of need. . . Imagine had you come a second too late, surely that would have been my end.”

The panicked screams of the people living in these houses slowly began to be heard, louder and louder, and these screams sounded like Mozart to the ears of the Berserker. Already relieved from the previous blow, and particularly enraged, Herostratus still took the time to think. His wound had worsened in the middle of his attack, like a stroke of bad luck. Berserker wasn&#39;t a doctor, but that must have meant that Rider&#39;s blow was much more serious than expected and that Berserker would have to be careful with his next moves to avoid dying just because of a sudden move. Suddenly, while he was thinking in the middle of the flames, he felt something grab him. He turned his eyes and came face to face with a young woman asking him in a feverish voice for help, it was clear that she was getting high from the flames but unfortunately, she had fallen on the wrong hero. Who was she to dare to defile the divine clothes of the Greek? She was nobody and to remind her of this fact, Herostratus hit her violently to get her away from him before finally approaching and perforating her chest with his bare arm. Not being a doctor, it takes him several seconds to find the young woman&#39;s heart, watching her die with eyes full of fear and incomprehension.

Right when Herostratus had thrown the corpse towards Kalki’s position, he caught onto it, stumbling back a bit to make sure he did not fall, but for the flames, Devadatta made sure that whatever the man would have planned, it would have to be put an end to that attempt. As the flames came towards Kalki ready to engulf him, the horse powered forward, its movement swift and yet carrying what seemed to be the winds of Bernice with it. Within the middle of the flames came the cloaked beast, its intention to ram into the servant at full speed, easily planning to trample him down if necessary, meanwhile, Kalki turned away for the moment, trying to take the young woman’s body away from the fiery hell the Greek had made. No, he had trusted Devadatta to handle the Greek servant, knowing how well he would be able to fight back, he was a familiar of Garuda, it was only time to see how well he put up against him!

Meanwhile, Kalki went to lay the body down, hopefully away from where the flames could have reached, trying to give it a proper burial and rest. He closed the woman’s eyes, said a small mantra, and gave a small prayer. 

“I hope this cycle will end peacefully for you dear stranger. . .

All the Greek heroes with whom he learned to read and write, those of whom the Iliad and the Odyssey spoke, were the chosen ones, the lucky ones whom the gods had chosen to be better than the others. He was neither a warrior nor a hero, he was even closer to the monster. However, he was not there by chance, he was there because the Anank&#233; had put him there and no one, however powerful, was going to stand up to his thirst for glory. This was not the determination of a warrior, not that of a monster either, it was the determination of Herostratus at its peak, the one that made him burn the greatest temple in the world single-handedly under the powerless eyes of a goddess.

<em><strong>Hit by the animal before finishing his sentence, Herostratus grabs the animal by the throat in a very uncomfortable position for both his arms and legs. He clings to the animal&#39;s long neck. The latter, in order to free himself from Herostratus&#39; grip, continues his charge and tries to crush the Berserker against the buildings further away, disappearing with Herostratus in the flames. Crushed by the walls against which his back was breaking, Herostratus had every intention of honouring his words. He set his hands on fire once more, hoping to burn the horse alive and stop it in its tracks. However, as if that wasn&#39;t enough for the Berserker, unable to use his arms and legs to fight, he sank his teeth into the horse&#39;s neck, seeking to use all his strength to tear out a piece of its throat. If the neck was known to be the weak point of men, it must have been for horses too. As Herostratus clenched with his teeth, the horse seemed to weaken and as he tore the piece of the poor animal&#39;s throat out, it collapsed to the ground, sending Herostratus flying a few feet away. The Berserker found the strength to get up, hoping to use the chaos created by the flames to escape. He left Kalki with a dilemma: save his pet, save the dozens of lives that were burning in the flames, or shoot Herostratus once and for all and lose everything else.

Not once would have had imagined that in his time, he’d hear his loyal companion let out a high pitched whinny out of sheer force from how the berserker had held it. 

Kalki put the deceased woman down, his attention strained between the multiple things he had to deal with. The people, the horse, the corpse. Three options and yet there were infinite solutions.

In fact, the wound inflicted on him grew grotesque in its own way, his once Coffee toned skin a singed black and grey, his pus turned green too, oozing out its attempt of bodily sap. Ah, the Dvapara Yuga. The second cycle. It’d only become worse from there. His grip on the sword was nearly non existent now, the blade dematerializing for now into the ether, but for Herostratus and the wound in his chest, a once hairline fracture would become everything everything but that. While he clung to the horse that thrashed about, his chest would feel a pressure as if it were cracking but multiple ribs at once. Once one would became to feel like many and the horse flailing around would only make that feel much worse. 

And to make matters worse, he would have the Rider once again on his tail, while Rider’s hands were disabled, if he had learned anything from those kicks and the strength before, then he’d know that going against him would have much a bigger problem than before. As the horse had his neck chewed on vigorously, bathing the man in a bloody spray of crimson, Kalki was full speed. It was time to make strategic moves for the Greek as well.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1106754214597763132 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1106754214597763132><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 12, 2023 8:26 PM">8:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="rubyrose9160">@Ruby Rose</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A brutal beast that roared and stamped and howled as it clawed its way towards the only thing it truly cared about: <strong>fame</strong>.

This Berserker was a monster. Even Illyn felt his stomach turned as it tore into Rider&#39;s vaunted steed. His stomach had turned when Berserker tore through those innocent people as they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. He felt nothing for them, it was simply bad luck. Unfortunate.

Illyn did not even notice the hypocrisy in his own beliefs in that very moment.

Losing his horse would make this battle difficult for Rider. Illyn was an accomplished magus, and so even as his reserves dropped, he was still capable of killing a hundred ordinary people if needed. 

People...

Shit.

<em>Rider, I have to focus on damage control. This Berserker is not only a threat to you and people around him, but the war itself. Kill him.</em>

As Berserker tore into Kalki&#39;s mount, the duo were suddenly flashed with enough lights to blind an ordinary person. They strobed in flashes of yellow, as bright as the sun. Were these... fireflies?

Illyn gave his Servant the smallest amount of aid he could, but hopefully it would disorient Berserker while Illyn focused on damage control. The magus took a rusty fire escape from the rooftop of the building into an alleyway near the burning houses. People would come quickly, and the fire from the houses lit the battlefield up like a firework.

With a sharp yank, the rusty fire escape went free. Illyn opened IBM and fed the metal into the machine. Soon, it printed out a functional shotgun similar to one Illyn had purchased after summoning Rider.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1106853197924012082 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1106853197924012082><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 13, 2023 2:59 AM">2:59 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Illyn sprinted near the burning houses and saw a fire hydrant. He cocked his shotgun.

<strong>BANG!</strong> The sound erupted as the the fire hydrant was blown apart, letting water erupt into the sky. He let the water attempt to coat the houses as he looked around. Already, people were beginning to gather to look at the carnage Rider and Berserker had unleashed. 

This was a disaster. This would be one of the loudest battles of the war, and if any Master had familiars, they would recognize both him and Rider. Blast. Yet he was a magus and still had an obligation. Especially now that he was seen. If the damage was catastrophic enough, the Mage&#39;s Association could be contacted. 

If that happened, it was <strong>game over</strong>.

Illyn tapped into his magecraft, and shouted at the small crowd of about twelve people.

&quot;<em><strong>This is a dangerous place. Please gather in that alleyway until the fire subsides.</strong></em>&quot;

It was hard to convince crowds, but they were already scared of the fire, and rushing into an alleyway where Berserker and Rider weren&#39;t fighting seemed far more reasonable then staring at a burning building.

They all vanished into the alleyway. Illyn contacted Rider.

<em>Our secret is safe.</em> The connection closed.

Magi had one universal rule about potential interactions with the World of Magecraft. Illyn had the same rule to prevent information regarding him from leaking out.

Death.

Illyn reproduced his shotgun, cocked it, and stepped into the alleyway.

Herostratus had really come across an opponent who was far too advantaged for him. Frankly, the ancient authors could have given Herostratus bewitched weapons and magical mounts. In any case, he could not die here, and even if he was ashamed, he had to survive, he had to continue his life and become the most famous person in the world, whatever it took. He had already made a deep impression on the minds of his two opponents, that was enough for today. Still hoping to escape, Herostratus intended to unleash an inferno of flame in his path to prevent his opponents from pursuing him. Thanks to the horse on the ground, Rider would surely have trouble catching up with him. He also used buildings as cover, literally passing through them to avoid detection. Wherever the fire started, Herostratus was passed, but each time it was already too late and the Berserker was further away. Finally, the flames stopped appearing in Herostratus&#39; path and the huge amount of flame and Mana released by it offered Herostratus a curtain of exit in order to escape Mana&#39;s detection (I hope).

Illyn’s reminder of him needing to solve this problem was not much help when he knew that something had to be done. And seeing how he was homing in on the beast of a servant, he was going to make sure that killing him was the most gracious thing he could do. He was no shiva, but he would try to commits feats like such. 

By the time he had gotten there, a curtain of flame blocked his line of sight, and while he had been ready to fight back, he knew sustaining new wounds wouldn’t have been the best at this current moment. And to make it much more of a moment of issue, when he did get there, there was nothing but Devadatta there on the floor, the horse’s white coat stained a blotchy red as he tried to calm itself. As a familiar, it wouldn’t die, but even the thought of seeing it in pain felt like a blade in the Rider’s stomach. When he looked over to try to see if the Greek had been there, the body was gone, as if he were simply taken from the world, only signed corpses too unfortunate to have crossed his path. Kalki rose a hand and the horse gave a small whine before it dispersed into the air, levaing Kalki to only see the destruction the two had caused. 

“Uh-oh. . . Seems there is much more of a mess than expected.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107427477871153153 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107427477871153153><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 5:01 PM">5:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Master, shall I simply return to you?

His statement was true fully, he could have tried to detect the mana around the are, but he couldn’t even sense the presence of another servant nearby him, it was as if he had just . . .disappeared. He waited for a moment, knowing that the answer would be to simply do such. The news would likely sum it up to a mysterious house fire, now he needed to get out before anyone saw his face anyways, so he did so without much of an answer from his master.

. . .

As Illyn was in the shadows, so was Rider, when the man had finished observing what he could, Kalki simply materialized before him, his face somber and unamused at the battle before. 

“Sadly, the lad got away. Seems he couldn’t fight much longer especially with the Cycle in play. . . That’s a shame.”

Rider showed his wrists, the way the skin burned and yet tried to rebuild itself was marvelous on its own, though likely Illyn wouldn’t have thought the same.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107427527619776532 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107427527619776532><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 5:01 PM">5:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="rubyrose9160">@Ruby Rose</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The dozen or so people who had fled the burning buildings resulting from Berserker and Rider&#39;s battle had been temporarily convinced by Illyn to take shelter in a darkened alleyway to avoid being noticed. Every person who ran into that alleyway wholeheartedly thought that they would be safe there.

They were wrong.

Rider manifested onto a splatter of blood roughly the size of a human male. Corpses were strewn everywhere, with a few being blasted apart. The scent of metal was unbearable.

<strong>Smack. Smack. Smack.</strong> The sound of something hard hitting flesh rang out in Rider&#39;s ears. <strong>Splatter. Thud.</strong> The sound of a metal object clanging against stone was heard as Illyn dropped the elongated weapon and instead pulled out a shotgun from IBM.

<strong>BANG!</strong> The head of a corpse vanished entirely as it was blasted apart by the shotgun blast. Every single person in the alleyway was missing a head. If there was a necromancer or magus capable of using sensory information from another body, Illyn did not want to risk it. 

Upon Kalki&#39;s manifestation, Illyn turned around. His body was covered in blood. &quot;Excellent, your condition seems solid.&quot; Illyn blinked once. &quot;It is unfortunate that you failed to kill Berserker. Pity. I could not find his Master.&quot; 

IBM sat in the middle of the carnage in its briefcase form. Illyn unceremoniously kicked a corpse into the gaping pit that made up the center of the Mystic Code. The body disappeared into nothingness. Even the blood near the device seemed to seep towards IBM, before disappearing into it like water down a drain.

&quot;Though I suspect that Servant had no Master. No magus could sustain a Berserker from so far away, and it explains why he had to consume humans. You two made a mess, and I don&#39;t want to rely on the Holy Church more than required.&quot;

Illyn&#39;s tone was casual, as if he were simply picking up groceries. &quot;Help me with these corpses, or go get the car.&quot; He looked up.

&quot;<strong>Now, Rider.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107461402878296155 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107461402878296155><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 7:16 PM">7:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbuss_">@Nimbus</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hell? The way blood had not escaped his vision was almost as if he felt maybe his sight had changed forever. Had the berserker punched him in the eye? Is that why he couldn’t get the sight of red out of his vision? He didn’t remember there ever being such an encounter and yet he hadn’t been fully sure if he damn sure were alive and seeing this. 

Bodies were thrown about as if they were rag dolls, limbs contorting and stretched to an almost cartoonish degree, threatening to rip a chuckle from the prophetic Rider’s throat. The stench of metal and blood so thick he almost felt he swallowed a clump of it. Kalki turned around,  his eyes darting to where he hoped would have been standing, for a second, he assumed Illyn could have been apart of it, another lifeless corpse that had been murdered in such a gruesome manner, and so frankly when he say his master someone still standing, a sense of disgust washed over him. 

He didn’t notice how much his senses seemed to sharpen to these things, how his eyes could take in such a sight of a head easily becoming detached from the body, or how loud a shotgun was, or how sticky hot blood felt against sweaty skin, but today he found out. Illyn’s own attempts too seemed to match the berserker’s. And for a quick second, the rider almost entertained the thought that he too had been one as well. Was it possible for a servant to be summoned by another? Did he become summoned by just a faceless madman? 

“What would you have done to the master? This? Illy—Master, what is this?”

The rider dropped his charm all together, his voice once soothed with honey was now bare and cracked, the sugar too sweet and old. The visual went on, how the bodies seemed to disappear without a trace into the case, to how Illyn tasked himself with speaking. 

“That is not what I need to worry about, the servant will die then for what he did, but <strong>what</strong> is this Illyn.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107483519564926996 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107483519564926996><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 8:44 PM">8:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>. 

Another slip of the man’s name, this time without a correction or fix. His eyes turned away, and yet the blood stretched on like an endless mural. He would have called out another when he heard the the man give him a command, his body ready to allow such though he couldn’t feel himself wanting to do anything of it. Help or grab the car. The thought hadn’t had much time to ruminate before he felt himself turn away, he needed to move. He need to get out of this at the moment. He could question and demand later, but for now, while he had little energy to truly move, and any energy to yell, he put it towards his struggle to grab the car. 

The rider disappeared, heading towards the location he had needed to, and once he had gotten there, for the first time he could truly say he felt the need to vomit. The taste of acidic mango jam he had once enjoyed now filthy and acidic.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107483576326430820 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107483576326430820><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 8:44 PM">8:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A few bodies were far too large to fit into IBM. With a crack and a splatter, their bones were broken to better be moved around. 

Bodies were heavy.  Illyn was not particularly strong, even as a magus. Reinforcement made the body stronger, yes, but that simply made it capable of breaking things and taking hits with greater ease. It did not increase Illy&#39;s capacity for picking up objects.

<strong>Crack. Splatter.</strong> Illyn mechanically went about his duty. IBM analyzed every single part of every single human being. Multiple blood types, multiple bone structures, multiple organs. Everything that was of value was copied and stored for future use.

These individuals would have their bodies replicated at a later point for experimental reasons. He purposely refused to scan their memories, not out of spite, but because he would attempt to reconstruct them. An impossible task for many, but doable for a genius.

The blood continued flowing into the device. The average human body contained four grams of iron in its blood. The average bullet was six grams. Every human body wasn&#39;t even worth its weight in what had killed it.

It was for that reason why Illyn spat on the world. Numbers. Volume. Surface area. All of these laws were ironclad, but something could be destroyed by something worth a fraction of it in physical material.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107493072746598470 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107493072746598470><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 9:22 PM">9:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yet things such as love and attraction did not fall into that purview. There was no way to measure how much someone loved another in traditional metrics. When Illyn first got married, he asked himself a question:

<em>What kind of creator does not put a value on the things most important to its creations? Is that truly just?</em>

<strong>Splatter.</strong>

That was what Rider did not understand. His disgust for Illyn meant nothing to him. Using his name meant nothing to him. Rider could claim that Illyn crossed a line, but Rider had summoned himself to this world. He had stepped over a line that Illyn valued above all just to boast of his precious &#39;wheel&#39;.

So he hated Illyn? Fine. <strong>Illyn hated him more.</strong>

Finishing his cleanup, Illyn picked up IBM in briefcase form and walked out to the road. Headlights were shining, and Illyn casually stepped into the car as it drove off.
