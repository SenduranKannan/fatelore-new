Pyg was covered in filth, and still smoldering in many places. A chance to cool down would do them a lot of good.

Together, they trudged on. If a building got in their way, they plowed through it without hesitation. Innocent civilians became victims, as they were trampled, crushed, or swept away by their massive limbs. The downtown area was in disarray; people screamed as they dispersed, trying to get as far away from the beast as possible.

So much for staying discreet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119042249586655232 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119042249586655232><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:14 PM">6:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill&#39;s voice echoed in Lachlan&#39;s mind, but it was no different than the buzzing of cicadas. Pyg&#39;s thoughts were far more overwhelming, stealing the Dowling&#39;s full attention like persistent tendrils wrapped around the boy&#39;s brain. The puppet and puppeteer had become one, and such a taxing symbiosis had no room for third wheels in it.

<em>clop clop clop clop</em>

But Archer would try regardless. Leapfrog was on hot pursuit, running on all fours in a debris road as its nails and fingers were starting to look crunched and bloody from Bill&#39;s abuse. Being used as a horse was tough, especially when you were carrying someone as tall and heavy as Bill around. Despite the pain, the puppet kept moving forward, its mind completely eroded into a servile state, no different than a broken horse that listened to whips, spuds and scolding.

&quot;Look where yer going, ya stupid donkey!&quot; Bill snarled, slapping at whatever could be considered Leapfrog&#39;s head. The poor puppet exhaled a weak cry, similar to the cross between a cow and a rabbit. Bill paid it no mind, ignoring it as he incited the beast to steer away from rubble since it was faster to move on even terrain. What remained of it, at least.

It was rather easy to find where Lachlan and Pyg had gone: They hadn&#39;t exactly been subtle about their trail of destruction. Pyg was a menace, more than any other puppet, having already left a valley of bodies and buildings in its wake. The only saving grace was that it was lumbering and huge, therefore nowhere near as fast as Leapfrog. They managed to catch up to the beast in a matter of minutes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119042761241415841 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119042761241415841><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:16 PM">6:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill stared at the fused pile of flesh and bodies sewn together. It was far more disgusting than he had expected, now revealed in its full, open glory as they were outside the sewers. On top of its shoulder was Lachlan, standing still and unharmed, as if he was fine with being there.

Regardless of whether he was conscious or not, Bill had a billion issues with his Master running away from him, hence why he came prepared. &quot;Keep moving, idiot!&quot; He slapped Leapfrog again, asking the puppet to increase the pace. This wouldn&#39;t work unless they were at least slightly ahead of Pyg, after all.

<em>clop clop clop clop CLOP</em>

The horse kept galloping to Pyg&#39;s side, keeping a safe distance to avoid aftershocks of the puppet&#39;s steps and any nearby debris. Within a minute and a half, they had surpassed the fleshy beast. Bill then reached for his waist, revealing something that he had picked up from the sewers: An iron chain. One tied up into a knot in a way similar to a lasso.

Without a word, he immediately spun the chain above his head, then he proceeded to throw it at the gigantic Pyg. It was all instinct and experience, but Bill&#39;s subconscious was already calculating the perfect trajectory and angle to catch his prey...

<em>wrap</em>

With a satisfying rattle, the chain wrapped itself around Lachlan like a nest of snakes, dragging him down with its weight. It was making him teeter off the edge. One further push...

<em>&lt;Jump down, idiot!&gt;</em> Bill shouted, trying to get his Master to do half of the work for him. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While they recognized Leapfrog&#39;s kinship, they currently operated under different commands, and as such, they could be considered separate entities. At this moment, Pyg prioritized their own needs over that of communicating with a pesky outsider.

Until the chains rattled.

The beast halted its stride. Slowly, it turned its dilapidated eyes towards Archer. They felt Bill&#39;s thoughts again knocking on the fringe of their consciousness, but the Archer was not granted admission to the council of thirteen minds. Therefore, he would have to wait.

<em>WHY DOES HE FOLLOW WHAT DOES HE NEED US FOR WHY DOES HE NEED US AT ALL</em>

Twelve minds turned their attention to that of the puppeteer.

<em>YOU. SPEAK.</em>

<em>I will,</em> the mouthpiece responded.

Lachlan did not resist. When Bill tugged on the chain, he allowed himself to be pulled along. Pyg extended its arm, turning it into a makeshift slide as Lachlan half slid, half skidded down the beast&#39;s shoulder. He landed on his backside. Not the most graceful landing he&#39;d stuck, but then again, his arms were quite literally tied, and this body of his hadn&#39;t always been the greatest at performing gymnastics.

So he simply gave up, and stared up at Archer from the ground. &#39;I&#39;m here,&#39; he said. 

Pyg let out a deep grunt. They continued forging ahead, leaving their designated spokesperson behind.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119042834163564554 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119042834163564554><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:16 PM">6:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

An observant person could tell, however, that the Master&#39;s feet no longer felt planted to Pyg&#39;s fleshy shoulder, along with the Dowling&#39;s body feeling a lot looser than usual. In fact, the boy didn&#39;t resist the chain&#39;s embrace, sliding down Pyg and landing on the ground as the puppet abandoned them.

Bill&#39;s shadow loomed over Lachlan, watching the boy remain still in that twisty, unflattering pose, no different than a broken doll. Archer got down Leapfrog, taking care to not stumble in the face of Pyg&#39;s tremors. He promptly grabbed Lachlan by the collar and slapped them on the cheek.

&quot;Wake up! What is <em>wrong</em> with you?!&quot; Bill asked, half a question, a quarter a rant and one hundred percent a scolding. &quot;That thing of yours is still fucking up the city!&quot; He pointed to Pyg, who was still rampaging without its &#39;head&#39;, or at least Bill thought that Lachlan was supposed to be the brains to the brawn.

&quot;Yer trying to put a huge sign on our ass that says <em>&#39;Enemy Master Here&#39;</em> or something?!

Normally, such a disrespectful gesture would have sparked an immediately pushback. But curiously, Lachlan found himself unprovoked. 

No, it wasn&#39;t as if he had lost his senses; rather, a crucial part of his brain—the one responsible for receiving feedback from his nerve endings, processing it, and generating an appropriate response—felt dampened, like it had been diluted from within.

Instead, his thoughts were overpowered by a singular, burning conviction.

<strong>&#39;Water,&#39;</strong> the puppeteer muttered, his words a bit slurred as he was being shaken about. &#39;We are damaged. Water will help.&#39; He turned his head towards the wake of destruction left behind by Pyg in the distance, only dimly aware of the chaos on the streets. From his perspective, Pyg was merely clearing away obstacles that hindered their progress to the shore. There was nothing wrong with that.

&#39;This is what we agreed on, anyway.&#39; He jabbed a finger into Bill&#39;s chest, feeling the need to defend his puppet like a mother hen protecting its oversized chick. &#39;<em>You</em> kill the Servant. <em>We</em> kill the Master.

That thought burned into Bill&#39;s mind as he watched Lachlan react like a limp fish: Devoid of life and simply being carried by the waves. He shook the kid hard while talking him down, only to hear more garbage reinforcing the fish theory. Why did his Master want water all of a sudden?

Then he poked at him and took his turn to talk him down. It rang hollow, missing the usual Dowling punch as his words felt more like monotone statements than spiteful comments designed to hurt. There was a sense of protection and self-preservation behind those. Lachlan had plenty of the latter, but <em>nothing</em> of the former: He would sooner abandon Bill than risk his life for him.

&quot;I <em>was</em> gonna do that.&quot; Bill snarled, grabbing at Lachlan&#39;s finger and wrapping his whole fist around it. &quot;Until you just jumped up and left, leaving me stuck with <em>two</em> enemies at once. What the hell were you thinking?! Are you <em>even thinking right now?&quot;</em>

It was a redundant question. Bill might barely know Lachlan, but he knew him well enough to know how his Master reacted in the face of failure. This wasn&#39;t one of his usual reactions.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043247994568724 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043247994568724><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:18 PM">6:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He turned his head to the right, staring at whatever his Master was looking at. Just as he thought, it was none other than Pyg, who had now covered a decent amount of ground. The giant puppet was still focused on reaching the shore, demolishing any of its surroundings and decimating any civilians unlucky enough to stand in its way. Shops were torn down, stalls were broken, even a nearby bar that said ARCADE or something had been cleaved in half.

&quot;That Pyg is a nuisance, is what!&quot; Bill shouted, instinctively taking out his gun and pointing at the puppet from afar. Before Lachlan could even react, he pulled the trigger.

<em>BANG!</em>

The bullet whizzed right through Pyg&#39;s flesh, entering its back and emerging from its stomach. It crossed skin, bone, organs and veins, penetrating its alimighty flesh like a hot knife through butter. For it to be harmed so easily felt almost sacrilegeous.

&quot;Tell that monster to stop, unless you want <em>me</em> to make it stop!&quot; Archer turned his face back to his Master, barking at them. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was gripping his finger rather tightly. Should he be concerned? He felt like he should, what if the man broke it? But then again, the condition of his own finger had no bearing on Pyg&#39;s state. Besides, Bill had raised a very good point.

&#39;You&#39;re right.&#39; He nodded. &#39;We left the woman in the sewers. In your care. We should have brought her along. No need for a return trip either if we did that. By gods, how did we overlook that?&#39;

Admission came easy when you had a chorus of twelve minds echoing Bill&#39;s sentiments in the background. Admission came <em>especially</em> easy when most of those minds had their higher functions stripped away. Despite Lachlan&#39;s tendency for sarcasm, his own voice accounted for only 7% of the collective consciousness. The remaining majority unanimously agreed that Bill&#39;s words carried true wisdom.

And so he believe them as well.

&#39;Bill, you are a genius.&#39; He dubbed the Archer as if conferring him his knighthood. Then, with renewed vigor, he clapped his hands twice and called out, both audibly and telepathically, &#39;Let&#39;s turn back first! We&#39;ll retrieve the woman—&#39;

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

Lachlan winced. The back of his mind spasmed with shock.

<em>Ow, ow,</em> he thought. <em>Owowow...</em>

He felt the impact well: felt Pyg&#39;s confusion, its bewilderment, its pain. The sensation pierced his skull like a migraine. His hand instinctively reached to the side of his head. In the distance, Pyg howled.

Then it swiveled its massive body, twisting its head unnaturally until it locked eyes with Bill. A single thought anchored itself in Lachlan&#39;s mind.

<em>WHAT THE HELL—</em>

&#39;—are you doing?&#39; Lachlan scowled at Bill, who had taken advantage of Pyg&#39;s lumbering form to fire a bullet into its back. The bullet tore though Pyg&#39;s stomach, leaving behind a gaping hole large enough to slide an entire arm through. The firepower of a Servant was simply on another level compared to that of a typical firearm.

He was seeing red, his pupils splattered by blood as all he could think about was his next victim. His thoughts juggled, split between murdering his own Master or the vicious puppet terrorizing the vicinity instead. The only thing that snapped him out of it was Lachlan&#39;s uncharacteristic response to his tantrum.

A scolding. A snarl. A string of words dripping with sarcasm. A tongue laced with venom. There were many things that he had expected from the Dowling boy: Calling him a genius was not one of them.

Had he been in a better mood, maybe he would have even blushed.

&quot;...What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; Bill glared at his Master, tempted to sew their mouth shut. &quot;Snap out of it! The woman is gone!&quot; He snapped his fingers in Lachlan&#39;s face, wondering if they were still conscious. Not even booze could reduce a human to such a pitiful state. Just what exactly had happened in the sewers?

Then Pyg cried. Bill couldn&#39;t help but tilt his head to stare at the beast, especially since Leapfrog was cowering behind a wall as well, terrified of the superior puppet. They were quite a distance away, but there was no mistaking those intense eyes: Pyg was staring Bill down, sizing him up and seeing him as a target. Lachlan then followed suit, speaking up and talking big game, as if the puppet were more of a Servant than Bill.

Perhaps that&#39;s why veins started popping in Bill&#39;s head. A gun was a gun. A puppet was a puppet. Both were tools designed to be used by their masters, they could not be compared to a Master-Servant relationship, nor a pact between a ringleader and gang members. That&#39;s why Bill felt furious, incapable of understanding why Lachlan was so fixated on that ugly puppet, to the point he was practically acting like the puppet&#39;s <em>slave.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043445718253588 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043445718253588><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Had he forgotten their conversation? Their agreement to steal the Grail? Why were they wasting time on this pile of meat? Even worse, had Bill <strong>misjudged</strong> him? Had he projected so hard into Lachlan with his own experience, but they were actually nothing alike?

He was thinking too much. His head was overheating. Pyg&#39;s arrival was imminent and Leapfrog had started to run away. During times like these, there was only one thing that Bill could do.

He took out his left pistol, then his right. He pointed both at the massive puppet carcass that was now just twenty meters away from them. Pyg would look a lot more imposing if it weren&#39;t for the giant hole in its body. What did it expect, that Bill was just going to keel over and die?

&quot;Apology?&quot; Bill asked, cracking a smile that couldn&#39;t even hide his bloodlust. <em>&quot;I&#39;ll make it apologize.&quot;</em>

Without further ado, he pulled both triggers, aiming at areas that would not only hurt a human body, but cause tremendous pain. It was a puppet, of course, so the damage wouldn&#39;t necessarily translate. But as a wise man once said, there is no need to shoot down a single apple if you burn the entire forest down.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043487984255066 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043487984255066><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

More bullets hit Pyg&#39;s skin, feeling like artillery shells as they penetrated the flesh and broke down the bone. Even worse, Lachlan was feeling every millisecond of it, and Bill was completely oblivious.

Would he even have stopped if he knew?

&quot;Want some&quot;

<em>BANG!</em>

&quot;more?&quot;

<em>BANG!</em>

&quot;Huh?&quot; He asked, wondering if eight bullets was enough to paralyze the beast. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His brows smoothed over as if a weight had been lifted at Bill&#39;s response. In that briefly moment, the storm of complaints in the recesses of his mind quieted, as they registered Bill&#39;s utterance of the word &#39;apology&#39;. 

How considerate of him to offer.

This switch in demeanor was reflective of the way each puppet&#39;s brain—or in Pyg&#39;s case, <em>multiple</em> brains—had been conditioned. They had been rendered highly responsive to even the slightest promises of a reward. Or in this case, an apology. They had been trained to be easily satiated, making them pliable to the puppeteer&#39;s will; it was a dangerous method of manipulation that was akin to controlling a drug addict by providing them with the occasional doses of their substance of choice.

Lachlan&#39;s reactions mirrored the mindset of his puppet, unbeknownst to Bill. Puppetry was a dangerous thing: what connects also controls, and Lachlan was being consumed by the very connection that he had forged with Pyg. Though his base intellect was there, his actions had been greatly influenced by the influx of raw instinct exuded from his puppet.

That was why Lachlan actually <em>beamed</em> at Bill.

He made a gesture of invitation. &#39;Go right ahead,&#39; he said, moving aside for the cowboy to prepare himself as Pyg bounded towards them, no longer as a ferocious beast but rather an overgrown puppy. The creature&#39;s mind was simple; it was interpreting the opening as an opportunity for treats.

But then came the resounding <em>BANG!</em>

Treats were indeed delivered, just not the ones Pyg had anticipated. Blazing hot bullets, infused with pure mana, tore through its colossal form. Explosions erupted upon impact; its body burst apart, and a pink, goopy paste made of flesh rained down, coating the ground with gore.

Bill had aimed for the conventional lethal spots, scaled up to match Pyg&#39;s size—a strategic assault on the brain, heart, and diaphragm. Then he moved on to the limbs as he disabled them one after another, until the once-menacing beast lay in a crippled mound of flesh.

No, the beast was far from dead. The Dowling brand of magecraft would ensure that. However, its existence was now next to useless, and pitiful all the same. It couldn&#39;t even cry out and pollute Bill&#39;s ears with its howling, due to its throat being severed by another bullet...

But despite Pyg&#39;s silence, wailing still echoed in Bill&#39;s ears. Had he gone mental?

&#39;WAAAAAAAUGH!&#39;

A most unexpected scene unfolded as he looked down. Lachlan had collapsed. He clung to Bill&#39;s overcoat, tears streaming down his face as he convulsed with heart-wrenching sobs. He curled up and started rolling on the ground, all the while clutching his head as if he was suffering from immense pain.

<strong>&#39;Liar!&#39;</strong> The puppeteer accused a befuddled Archer through choked sobs. &#39;Liar, liar, liar! You said you&#39;d apologize!&#39; He clawed at his head, hugged himself, and wept like a baby. And, more surreally, he sounded genuinely hurt.

&#39;Why does it hurt?&#39; He pounded the ground, as another bout of pain exploded in his mind. &#39;Why do I hurt? You said you&#39;d apologize. You said you&#39;d apologize! You said you&#39;d apologize, apologize, apologize, <strong>APOLOGIZE!</strong>&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043573078306827 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043573078306827><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It would certainly explain why Lachlan&#39;s demeanor had changed, from giving off scowls to pouting like a puppy at the cowboy&#39;s mention of an apology. It creeped Bill out, for Lachlan&#39;s face was never meant to beg. The brat had spent their entire life training their face muscles to frown. To use them for anything but their intended purpose resulted in a huge case of the uncanny valley.

&quot;Too close.&quot; Bill blurted out, shoving Lachlan away as a shiver ran down his body. &quot;Back off some.&quot; It was more of an excuse to avoid looking at the brat&#39;s face, since it creeped him out.

Pyg was doing the same, though Archer couldn&#39;t tell. All he saw was a lumbering puppet mass heading straight for him. He didn&#39;t know that it was simply following its training, expecting a paw shake the same way a dog would.

Unfortunately, Pyg&#39;s dreams would soon be broken. A rain of bullets destroyed it, the damage reducing it to a fraction of its original size. Lachlan&#39;s puppy eyes had also degenerated into confused, pained tears. He wailed like a baby, confusing Archer even more before the would-be Master clung at his coat.

&quot;The fuck-&quot; Bill shouted out, shaking Lachlan off only to watch the boy collapse on the ground, convulsing and shaking like a man who had taken a bullet to the brain. It was a horrid sight whenever that happened, usually when Bill took potshots at someone&#39;s head but they jerked back last minute. The result was a bullet that perforated only part of the brain, leading to a slow, agonizing death as the body essentially went berserk, trying its best to understand why it was failing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043711070900264 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043711070900264><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:20 PM">6:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
This instinctively made Bill worry that his Master was dying, before realizing that Lachlan had no injuries. The damage seemed to be mental, causing Bill to once again attempt to form a connection-

Nope. Just static and a faint sense of pain, but he couldn&#39;t reach Lachlan at all in that jumbled mess. He snapped out of it, only to be assaulted on all sides by Lachlan&#39;s incessant whining: The Dowling was crying their eyes and lungs out, directing curses at Bill and telling him to apologize.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?! Snap out of it!&quot; Bill tried to grab Lachlan up, but got slapped away by the boy&#39;s convulsing movements. They kept crying like there was no tomorrow, agonizing over Pyg&#39;s damage as they felt every single bullet.

&quot;Your puppet&#39;s a fucking <em>carcass!</em> It can&#39;t even hear my apology. Calm down!&quot; Bill ordered, but his pathetic Master kept wailing. They had regressed to the mindset of a baby, one missing their mother and being completely useless as a result. Just what Bill needed: More dead weight on his plate. It pissed him off beyond measure.

What had Lachlan even <em>done</em> today? After all that talk from earlier, back in the car, this was the <em>most</em> the Dowling could manage? He remembered the big talk from back then, the so-called agreement they had come to. The brat had even wasted a Command Spell on him just to torture him, which he had foolishly let slide.

This was his reward. A petulant, crying wreck that had once again stopped Bill from fulfilling his mission. He was also one hundred percent sure that once Lachlan broke out of this childish tantrum, <em>he</em> would still get all the blame. Something about how much of an incompetent moron Archer was for not reading his Master&#39;s mind or instantly solving the Dowling&#39;s problems.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043728355639386 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043728355639386><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:20 PM">6:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Why was he putting up with this &amp;#$!?

Bill was content with letting this thoughts fester in his mind, not acting on them for they weren&#39;t exactly wise. This logic soon flew out of the window once his ears heard more of Lachlan&#39;s incessant crying. He couldn&#39;t hold it any longer.

<strong>&quot;SHUT THE HELL UP!&quot;</strong> Bill growled, kicking the downed Lachlan in the gut. If he were a Saber, or even a Lancer, there was a risk that his kick might have killed his Master right there. Thankfully, he was nothing more than a measly Archer, a Class that was terrible at close-range combat, especially someone with Bill&#39;s history.

It was still a kick to the gut. From a Servant. Lachlan&#39;s pain was soon doubled as he felt his insides wanting to spill out, mixing with Pyg&#39;s pain and almost frying his brain from the sensation. This caused yet another whimper-

<em>STOMP</em>

-Which Bill followed up with another kick, almost instinctively.

&quot;Apologize for what? HUH?!&quot; Bill shouted. &quot;I don&#39;t owe you a <em>damn</em> thing.&quot; He pointed down repeatedly, then pointed at Pyg&#39;s body in the distance. &quot;All of this, falling apart like this, is on <em>you!&quot;</em> He shouted with conviction.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043847750697000 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043847750697000><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:20 PM">6:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Of course, he received no reply. Nothing but tears. But Bill wasn&#39;t looking for an answer in that moment. All he wanted was a place to speak.

&quot;Ya could&#39;ve shut yer mouth. Ya could&#39;ve have listened to me. But no! You just had to be the man, didn&#39;t you? The man daddy always wanted ya to be. If ya&#39;d done your job, known your place, then-&quot;

He kept scolding him, like a parent reprimanding a misbehaving child. Perhaps due to that, or due to Bill making clear eye contact, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit bad about it. 

Kicking an injured animal would make a normal man sick. Bill wasn&#39;t normal, and killing those who had surrendered or lost a duel was common to him back in the day. Despite that, he couldn&#39;t help but feel pity for Lachlan in that state: The kid was moaning, talking about pain and apologies as the endured Bill&#39;s abuse. Clearly, something had gone wrong. Clearly, Lachlan was not in the right state of mind. This wasn&#39;t the real Dowling heir and Bill had already realized that 10 minutes ago, yet he was still playing pretend.

For what? Did he just want an excuse to rant after that disastrous encounter with Saber? Did he think the &#39;real&#39; Lachlan would not let him run his mouth and feelings out. Maybe Bill was a coward too, choosing to only speak up when Lachlan had no power to retaliate.

He was a bully. A big, bad, mean bully. No different than the 30 year old slobs that would beat him and abuse him at saloons back in the day. He cowered in fear in the fetal position, lying in the corners of bars as people tossed bottles at his body whenever he got knocked out in a fight. Lachlan&#39;s current state reminded him of those days.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043894475239505 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043894475239505><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:20 PM">6:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Pitiful and weak. Disgusting and poor. He wanted to stomp that being out of existence, while simultaneously wanting to protect it. Lachlan pissed him off, yet at the same time, he felt like puking at the thought of kicking his Master once more. Anytime he raised his leg, he couldn&#39;t help but see his own face on the receiving end.

At the end, he kicked.

A splash of mud washed over Lachlan&#39;s face and hair, running over his tears.

&quot;Wake the fuck up! Ya wanna end up like yer damn pet?!&quot; Bill snarled, referring to Pyg. He then looked around for a sign of Leapfrog, because he&#39;d be damned to carry Lachlan all the way to Roland-

Leapfrog wasn&#39;t there. The puppet had left upon seeing its Master be abused. Clearly, it had gone to find help, most likely Roland himself.

&quot;Great.&quot; Bill sighed, sitting on a nearby slate of marble as he waited for Roland to arrive, observe the disastrous scene and give him an earful like the trained dog he was. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He gagged, unable to contain the reflex, and vomited, the acidic fluid burning his throat and causing his eyes to well up with even more tears.

But Bill showed no mercy. He continued his assault, relentlessly kicking his Master like a bully laying into a defenseless puppy. Lachlan clutched his head as he was thrown about. 

&#39;Stop!&#39; He cried. The pleading was genuine. The pain overwhelmed what little cognitive processing power remained in his brain.

<em>Just what had <strong>they</strong> done to deserve this?</em>
<em>Endure it.</em>
<em>We&#39;re going to kill that bastard!</em>
<em>Let it end! Just let it end!</em>...

Eventually, the kicking ceased. Lachlan rolled away, still retching and gasping for breath. Dirt clung to his hair, which was plastered down with sweat. He looked every bit as wretched as the helpless kid Bill saw in his own memories...

And <em>that</em> hurt.

Bill couldn&#39;t bear to look at him. He even turned his gaze towards the distance, hoping for any interruption to break the silence. Perhaps Roland would appear and give him an earful. God, <em>anything</em> would do right about now...

&#39;I&#39;m sorry, <strong>master,</strong>&#39; Lachlan groaned weakly. &#39;I am...I really am...I...&#39;

<em>...Master?</em> 

An unlikely thought struck Bill. Just whom had he been talking to all this time?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119043955875655680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119043955875655680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:21 PM">6:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That proved to be too big of a challenge, as the weeping Dowling kept being assaulted by Pyg&#39;s cacophony. That collection of thoughts formed a mind, a scared, damaged mind that was fearful of its owner and also determined to escape their grasp. Years of conditioning and training that were now slamming down Lachlan&#39;s brain.

For Bill, it was far less deep. He didn&#39;t know about Pyg, nor did he know the full depths of Lachlan&#39;s Magecraft, only that his puppets were freakish abominations, especially due to their similarity to people. He didn&#39;t know their inner workings, so in his eyes Lachlan just looked like a scared kid, one wondering if their aggressor would come back to &#39;finish the job&#39;. One wondering if the time was right to run away or if they should feign being dead a bit longer.

What caught him off guard was when the boy spoke, saying something that his Master would have never said once in a million years, something that went against the entire concept of being a Dowling. Lachlan called him a <strong>master.</strong> Not as a joke, nor as a taunt. That voice carried unerring servitude, coming from the mind of someone that would be more than happy to lick Bill&#39;s shoes clean.

That&#39;s what made Bill double guess himself. This wasn&#39;t Lachlan, just a pale, ignoble imitation. He stood up from his rock and cautiously approached the boy lying on the floor.

&quot;What&#39;s yer name, punk?&quot; Bill asked while raising his foot, as if threatening another kick. If this person was truly as servile as they appeared, they should have no issues revealing themselves. &quot;What have ya done with da boy? Don&#39;t tell me yer-&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044046174834718 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044046174834718><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:21 PM">6:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He stared at Pyg&#39;s carcass in the distance. It was &#39;dead&#39;, but still functioning. Puppets did not die easily. Come to think of it, back in the car, Lachlan told him a story of his twin brother. One who had studied the same art, and as a result, caused one of his puppets to go berserk.

Puppets weren&#39;t machines. They were most likely controlled with some voodoo shit that Bill had no clue about. However, he never saw Lachlan raise his hands or perform some mystical mumbo jumbo whenever he used Pyg or Leapfrog. It felt more like he was treating them as additional Servants, forming a telepathic link with them. This meant that they shared thoughts, so-

<strong>&quot;You&#39;re that thing?!&quot;</strong> Bill exclaimed in disgusted, glancing at Pyg, then back to Lachlan and back to Pyg. This servile attitude that came out of nowhere. His Master&#39;s barely coherent speech. It all made sense now.

He felt like an idiot. A complete waste of life. How could he have <em>not</em> realized this? Even a toddler could have figured out that someone as Lachlan Dowling would have never put themselves in such an embarrassing position.

Was he <em>that</em> desperate to form a connection with his Master? To find something that he could project onto? Maybe he thought his life would be easier if Lachlan was just an obedient little kid. He felt sick down his guts for having such pathetic thoughts cross his mind.

&quot;Well? Answer me!&quot; He demanded an answer from the Pyg in Lachlan&#39;s body. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked at Bill through tear-filled eyes. When Bill likened him to Pyg, there were no signs of denial, or even a flinch. Rather, the plain acceptance in his demeanor told the Archer all there was to know.

&#39;I&#39;m...not. I&#39;m not,&#39; Lachlan stammered. &#39;I&#39;m...&#39;

Bill&#39;s question sent his mind spiraling into uncertainty. He was Lachlan James Dowling, wasn&#39;t he? Only that his thoughts, his sensations, and his emotions had come into alignment with...

<em>Who am I?</em>
A thought bloomed in his mind.

<em>Who <strong>was</strong> I?</em>
Followed by another.

<em>What is my name?</em>

Lachlan stared at Bill with vacant eyes. Right now, he was a man, a woman; he was a person, an arm, a head; he was under Bill&#39;s foot, collapsed against a building, severed and laying several feet away from the main body; he was both here, and there, being interrogated, being ignored. He was all of that. All at once.

The sensation was maddening.

&#39;There&#39;s something wrong with me,&#39; he said.

This was, arguably, the most sane thing he had uttered today. It almost sounded like a plea. But as quickly as that moment of clarity emerged, it dissolved again, and Lachlan questioned himself once more. <em>Why would there be anything wrong with him?</em>

Of course...<em>they</em> had messed up. That was the only answer.

&#39;Don&#39;t punish me,&#39; he reverted to being Pyg&#39;s advocate. &#39;My body...it hurts. You broke my legs...&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was referring to the puppet, obviously. But then his eyes returned to Lachlan and Bill, and he blanched.

&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; He raised his voice in alarm, then knelt down and placed his hands on Lachlan&#39;s shoulders, studying the puppeteer&#39;s face. &#39;What&#39;s wrong with him?&#39; He shot a quizzical look towards Bill. &#39;I thought you guys went to the other side of town?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044137556135980 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044137556135980><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:21 PM">6:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He tilted his head, observing any slight movement in Lachlan&#39;s face, neck, arms, fingertips. He had gotten good at that after hundreds of quickdraws, usually just as a way to pull his gun faster, but it also proved to be useful to inspect people&#39;s mood. Lachlan was obviously in a distressed state, he could tell that much, but then the boy spoke up. The way he talked almost confirmed his theory.

&quot;Ya think?&quot; Bill scoffed, replying to Lachlan&#39;s statement with annoyance. He felt even more ticked off as his Master returned to pleading for their life, begging Bill to stop. &quot;Get back up, your legs look fine.&quot; He said, trying to lift them up, until he heard someone&#39;s hurried footsteps in the distance.

He immediately dropped Lachlan and raised his gun, wondering if Saber and their Master had pursued them. Instead, Roland appeared, staring at Pyg for a second before noticing Lachlan and Bill&#39;s state.

Like a good lapdog, Roland immediately came to Lachlan&#39;s assistance. Bill sighed, holstering his gun as the Dowling&#39;s slave immediately barraged him with questions.

&quot;Beats me.&quot; Bill replied, standoffish and pissed off. &quot;We were on a corpse run and were lucky enough to get into a scuffle with another Master and Servant pair. They are gone now, but then yer boss started acting up, fucking off with that puppet and ranting.&quot; His tone got intense as he recalled more and more details of this disastrous day.

&quot;Now he&#39;s crying like sweet baby Jesus just fell off his crib, and-&quot; He bit his lip and stopped. What was the point? All that mattered was that they had once again wasted more effort, resources and time, all because of Lachlan&#39;s erratic behavior.

&quot;Man, I don&#39;t even care anymore!&quot; Bill spat in disgust. &quot;Drag his ass back home or whatever ya wanna do. I&#39;m out.&quot; He turned around and started walking away, looking for any of Leapfrog. No dice; there was no way the puppet would be his ride again after seeing Pyg&#39;s brutal massacre.

He harrumphed, reluctantly going back to Roland as he kept his hands in his pockets. Roland himself would feel clueless, not only thinking that Bill gave him nothing to work with, but also feeling like something else had transpired there and he had just missed it.

But with the current situation seemingly growing out of control, Roland had no choice but to confront it head on. 

&#39;Where exactly are you located?&#39; He rocked the puppeteer back and forth, coaxing him with a question as perplexing as the behavior Bill had witnessed up till now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He continued to count on his fingers as he announced each location. When he reached the number ten, he lowered all fingers except for both index fingers, forming the shape of &#39;11&#39;. Then he added one middle finger to make the gesture of &#39;12&#39;, while mentioning something about a &#39;hippopotamus&#39;.

Right. Good job.&#39; Roland sighed. He supported Lachlan by draping one arm over his shoulder, then helped them both to stand. If he noticed the strange bruises covering Lachlan&#39;s body, he made no mention of any of them. Instead, he turned his attention to the rather agitated Archer.

&#39;So...I understand that this is all very confusing, and there are possibly a few things you <em>might</em> not know,&#39; he began cautiously, fully aware of Lachlan&#39;s current inability to use his Command Seals. He had been made wary of the incident at the graveyard during his brief absence; he&#39;d rather not provoke Bill and end up with a bullet between his eyes. So, for now, he tried his best to appeal to the Archer&#39;s better nature.

&#39;But, well, you heard the boss,&#39; he nodded towards Pyg. &#39;Pyg has 12 brains governing its consciousness...you were likely conversing with them.&#39; He confirmed Bill&#39;s suspicions.

What came next, though, caught Bill off guard.

&#39;Can you...remove a few of those brains?&#39; Roland suggested, eyes darting between the puppet and Bill. &#39;You&#39;re an Archer. It should be a piece of cake, right? Just aim for the more accessible parts and disable a few of them. That should snap him out of it,&#39; he concluded uncertainly.

Snap him out of this dumb mind and straight into the cold demeaning self?

&#39;Well, I hope it would, at any rate...&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044408076144721 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044408076144721><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:22 PM">6:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The two conversed and Archer huffed, on the lookout for curious passerby. Pyg had caused quite the storm, meaning that it wouldn&#39;t take long for nosy folk to show up. They had to leave soon.

But then Lachlan started yapping gibberish, the type of language that he&#39;d hear amongst doctors and know-it-alls. The young Master even raised his fingers to point out the number of ridiculous words he had spewed out.

&quot;Can ya tell him to shut up? I&#39;m not in a great mood.&quot; Bill warned. Oh, if only Roland knew of what happened prior...

But Bill&#39;s anger soon turned into confusion as Roland revealed the truth behind Lachlan&#39;s behaviour: That the person he was talking to was a collection of thoughts coming from the stray bodies that formed Pyg. He felt embarrassed, disgusted and also furious at that revelation. Couldn&#39;t Lachlan have simply warned him in advance that stuff like this could happen?!

Then Roland&#39;s request came and Bill just sneered at him. &quot;Piece of cake? Yer goddamn <em>right.&quot;</em> He grumbled, taking out his pistol and stepping towards Pyg&#39;s carcass. He cast a glance back to Roland as he did so.

&quot;Do ya think he&#39;ll feel that?&quot; He pointed his gun at Lachlan, before pointing it back to one of Pyg&#39;s brains. <strong>&quot;&#39;Cause I sure damn hope so.&quot;</strong>

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Bullets struck at Pyg&#39;s sensitive nucleuses, severing connections to three to five brains in one fell swoop. A whole part of the puppet&#39;s mind went dormant, falling into a deep slumber as Lachlan&#39;s voice grew stronger. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Roland couldn&#39;t help but let out a sigh of relief. The fact that Bill was willing to listen to him was a significant breakthrough. He had often watched Lachlan go into a foul mood whenever he engaged with the Servant, and it made him think that Bill was a tough nut to crack.

But then again, both Lachlan and Bill were strong-willed individuals. Meanwhile, Roland—<em>he</em>—didn&#39;t care much for that kind of bravado. Call him timid, a pussy, or a coward, it didn&#39;t matter to him. Growing up in a household with older and more accomplished siblings had molded him into someone who was quite comfortable with settling for mediocrity. 

So, if he had managed to survive working for Lachlan all these years, then surely it had to account for <em>something</em>, right?

Roland nodded emphatically as Bill primed his weapon. Having an Archer to assist meant that he and Lachlan would no longer have to worry about any of these puppets ever going out of control—

<em>&#39;Do ya think he’ll feel that?&#39;</em>

Bill&#39;s question threw him off guard. Roland stopped in his tracks.

&#39;Um.&#39; He stared blankly at Bill. &#39;What?&#39;

A part of him perceived Bill&#39;s question as purely academic, so he did his best to answer, even though it consisted mostly of guesswork. &#39;He didn&#39;t tell me. But he never seemed bothered when the Dancer or Leapfrog injured themselves. So...&#39;

Roland trailed off as he heard Bill&#39;s next words. He noticed the strange glint in their eyes, the hint of viciousness in their voice. A shiver ran down his spine. Could Bill actually be <em>hoping</em> for the bullets to hurt?

Roland started to hyperventilate. Why did Bill look almost murderous?

&#39;What happened while I was—&#39;

Bill unleashed a volley of bullets, each one striking a different part of Pyg&#39;s body with pinpoint precision and blasting through one of the brains. At the same time, Lachlan convulsed violently. A series of strangled, gurgling noises emitted from his throat. He struggled like a dying animal, limbs thrashing about and almost nailing Roland in the eye. 

But just as suddenly as the chaos began, the puppeteer&#39;s movements ceased completely, and he collapsed like a stringless puppet.

Roland scrambled to catch him, narrowly preventing his face from planting into the ground. With a grunt, he managed to support Lachlan on his shoulder once again.

Well, <em>that</em> certainly answered Bill&#39;s question.

Roland shot Bill a conflicted look.

He bit back the words hovering on his tongue.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044654583787643 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044654583787643><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:23 PM">6:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t seem pleased, despite having achieved a job well done. It seemed like petty revenge felt as empty as it sounded, as Lachlan&#39;s suffering did nothing to ease his frustrations.

&quot;Nothing important for ya.&quot; Bill replied cooly. &quot;You don&#39;t need to know the details. The Master is alive, right? That&#39;s all ya need to know.&quot; Archer scoffed, shrugging his shoulders. He treated Roland like a decor piece, no different than how the Dowling family had handled him. Roland knew that the two weren&#39;t particularly close, but it still felt a tinge painful to get the cold shoulder treatment even by Bill. So much for idolizing cowboys...

&quot;But if ya ask me, I dunno how ya can stand him.&quot; Bill let out, not even bothering to hide his distaste. He then walked past Roland and Pyg&#39;s carcass, trying to find the route back home. &quot;Ya could easily leave him behind.

He tried not to dwell on it. Sometimes, it was just so much easier to ignore the deeper meaning of things and go through the motions. After all, this was his job, wasn&#39;t it? 

He&#39;d had this conversation with himself a few times. A job kept him occupied, gave him <em>some</em> purpose, and during his downtime, he still had some semblance of freedom. Despite his strained relationship with Lachlan, the Dowlings paid him handsomely. A contract was a contract, and besides, he could never be sure whether his quality of life would have been better if he had stayed back home and worked for his older sister.

But still, couldn&#39;t he have found a more fulfilling job? One where he didn&#39;t have to endure being treated like a tea rag, always being at his boss&#39;s beck and call...

Roland shrugged. It was the shrug of someone who had their ambition crushed out of them. Someone who had made peace with the current state of affairs and thus, easily shrugged the invisible weight off his shoulders.

He had been chained to Lachlan&#39;s side against his will. But in his own way, he was free.

&#39;I&#39;m not any worse off for it,&#39; he admitted. &#39;It wasn&#39;t me who got injured, and I didn&#39;t have to put myself on the front lines like you. I got to travel Egypt, drink all the booze I couldn&#39;t back home—oh, by the way, I&#39;m of legal age now. I had my birthday last week! I&#39;d have invited you both if you weren&#39;t so busy tracking the news.&#39; 

Roland &#39;accused&#39; Bill, though didn&#39;t sound particularly hurt. In fact, Bill couldn&#39;t perceive any strong sentiment coming from the young man. Unlike Lachlan, whose emotions were practically transparent and brittle like glass, Roland&#39;s demeanor made it unclear whether he was genuinely unaffected, or simply hid his emotions well. It felt as if Bill was striking a cotton sack, and struggling to elicit a strong response.

He seemed intent on leaving the two boys behind, until Roland explained his reasoning for assisting Lachlan. His logic for willingly giving away his autonomy to the Dowling family was more than sound: He wasn&#39;t hurt, he never got involved in any dangerous work and so far the trip at Berenice had essentially been a miniature vacation for him. He was only tasked to work sometimes, much like weekday employment with a thick boss. If you squinted hard enough, there was little to no difference from Roland&#39;s life to that of the typical office worker.

That felt even worse to Bill, who got a much thicker frown upon hearing those words escape Roland&#39;s mouth. He turned around, furious as he inched closer.

&quot;Yeah, real good logic there. Cows love being milked too, so long as they still get grass.&quot; He spat out before glancing at the ground, so disgusted by Roland&#39;s statements that he couldn&#39;t even deign to look at him.

&quot;Ya know what happens to a cow after it&#39;s lived long enough?&quot; He pointed his gun to the earth. &quot;Bang. Straight to the slaughterhouse. Y&#39;all think yer smart, but people are a bunch of cows too. Just waiting for the day to be told to die.&quot; He grumbled, his words jumbled and his throat shaking from rage. Bill&#39;s capacity to hold it together was reaching its tipping point.

&quot;But I doubt that&#39;s news to you. You sound like you got it all figured out.&quot; Bill clasped his hands, his voice dripping with sarcasm that reminded Roland of Lachlan&#39;s own. &quot;Ya already sound like a corpse. Might as well keep acting like one.&quot; He said, taking potshots at Roland&#39;s lack of passion in his voice.

&quot;I just know that if it were me, if I were a cow and my bastard of an owner was asleep right next to me then-&quot; Bill raised his leg, then delivered a loud stomp. <strong>&quot;I&#39;d stomp their brains out.&quot;</strong> He snarled, then glared back to witness Roland&#39;s reaction. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He strategically moved himself a few steps away to avoid Bill&#39;s spittle, then tapped the tip of his shoe on the ground, shaking off the dirt that had accumulated from Bill&#39;s stomp.

&#39;You&#39;re no cow. You are <em>Cherokee Bill</em>,&#39; he met Bill&#39;s gaze head-on. Once again, Bill failed to find any trace of anger or humiliation in those undisturbed eyes. &#39;You&#39;re a legendary figure, a scumbag lord of the Wild West. You do as you please. And as a Servant, you possess even more power than your legend says, not to mention have the experience to back it all up! You don&#39;t stomp people&#39;s brains out because they own you...you do it because you can, right?&#39;

Roland offered his suggestion, then his eyes fell to Lachlan&#39;s unconscious form over his shoulder. The blonde studied the puppeteer for a while. Then he sighed and shook his head.

<strong>&#39;Well, neither am I.&#39;</strong> He said.

With a grunt, he adjusted his grip on Lachlan&#39;s body to better support his weight. &#39;I have my reasons,&#39; he said, then began to drag them both towards Leapfrog, who waited on them like a cab driver.

&#39;I&#39;ve done some things. Real stupid things,&#39; he confessed as he walked. &#39;I was just a kid, didn&#39;t know any better...but that&#39;s not really an excuse, now that I&#39;ve changed...we&#39;ve all changed.&#39;

Roland fussed a bit as he shoved Lachlan onto Leapfrog&#39;s back. Only after he made sure the puppeteer was secured did he turn to face Bill again. &#39;Just doing what I can, trying to make amends, y&#39;know?&#39; He shrugged. &#39;Until he&#39;s happy.&#39; Then, as if to lighten the mood, he gestured towards Pyg&#39;s enormous carcass drying out in the middle of the street. 

&#39;So! We&#39;ve got two jobs here. Wanna split?&#39; He clapped his hands together and announced in a more cheerful tone. &#39;Leapfrog needs steering, plus we need to drag Pyg back to the workshop. Can&#39;t just leave it here all day, or people will stare. Which one do you wanna take?&#39;

He replied instantly in his usual demeanor: Low powered and with barely any grit behind his words. His body language was like that of a broken horse, one that remembered the sharp spuds of the past and had started seeing all boots as equally sharp. 

That&#39;s only how he sounded, of course. Which is why Bill was caught off guard by the confidence in Roland&#39;s words. Well, confidence was the wrong way of putting it: It felt more like he had accepted his fate and was now at peace because of it. No frustrations or inner buildup to drag him down. He was powered by nothing more than the satisfaction of a job well done. His little speech accentuated that further.

&quot;Yer goddamn right. And ya know how I became Cherokee Bill?&quot; Bill raised his voice. &quot;&#39;Cause I was tired of getting milked. I beat them up and I made them <em>stay</em> down! I taught them that I ain&#39;t nobody to fuck with! I showed them who I was-&quot; He gestured agitatedly, putting passion in his voice as he clearly felt strongly on the matter. The fact that Roland wasn&#39;t reacting with the same intensity was pissing him off. He wanted Roland to see! To see what he also saw!

But that would never happen, because Roland wisely noticed that they weren&#39;t out of the woods yet. How could they ever be, when there was a gaping carcass sprawled all across the street?! They were lucky the police was incompetent enough to let them talk for ten minutes or so, but luck always ran out eventually, especially when outlaws and cringy names like <em>Lucky Seven</em> were involved.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044883949293648 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044883949293648><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:24 PM">6:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;-Fuck&#39;s sake!&quot; Bill interrupted his little tantrum, reluctantly joining Roland as he took command of Leapfrog and gave it a light kick with the spuds. He then took out the iron chain that he had used to drag Lachlan away. He handed it over to Roland.

&quot;Anchor this to that piece of shit over there.&quot; Bill pointed his thumb at Pyg&#39;s carcass. &quot;We&#39;ll just drag it home. A piece or two being missing isn&#39;t a big deal, right?&quot; It seemed like his plan was to go for an old school towing truck.

He grabbed the chain, secretly relieved that Bill had offered to take up both jobs. Horse riding had never been his forte, especially with a &#39;horse&#39; as peculiar as Leapfrog. He would gladly walk back if necessary...as long as he didn&#39;t attract too much attention, of course.

But speaking of attention...

&#39;Mind doing me another favor?&#39; Roland patted Leapfrog&#39;s back as Bill straddled himself across the creature. &#39;Cause a bit of a scene on your way back. Stir up some chaos in the streets, make sure there are no witnesses. And I&#39;ll...&#39; He hesitated. &#39;I&#39;ll help too, with Hypnosis. Can&#39;t guarantee it&#39;ll work, but at least I can play the role of a panicking tourist pretty convincingly.&#39;

He gave Bill a thumbs up, satisfied with the role he had assigned himself. He was ready to look past Bill&#39;s outburst as well: after all, Bill was <em>Lachlan&#39;s</em> Servant, so it was already a miracle that he had listened to Roland in the first place. In these brief moments, he had glimpsed what it felt like to be a stand-in Master. It felt pretty good, if only for a fleeting moment.

Roland started making his way towards Pyg. He halted after a few steps, then turned back to face Bill. A peculiar smile played at his lips, tinged with a hint of...sadness? Pity? Regret? Bill couldn&#39;t quite tell.

&#39;I&#39;m starting to see why it was <strong>you</strong> who emerged from that summoning circle,&#39; he mused. &#39;You and him...you really are cut from the same cloth.&#39;

Then he resumed his stride, and continued towards Pyg without another word.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:34 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119044914941001738 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119044914941001738><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:24 PM">6:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cowboy stared at Roland&#39;s handiwork with mild disgust: The work was perfect, with the chain wrapped around Pyg nicely, tied into a knot that would keep the puppet secured and capable of withstanding a bit of rough dragging. His issue lied more with Roland&#39;s acceptance of the situation, not opposing Bill in the slightest and not even trying to half-ass his job in an act of malicious compliance. Where were the boy&#39;s guts? His desire to break free of his chains?!

Bill felt tempted to speak up, but Roland beat him to it. He asked for a favor, one so peculiar that he couldn&#39;t believe his ears. &quot;Some ruckus?&quot; Bill asked, but it was clear what Roland wanted: A distraction to explain away the destroyed buildings and deceased victims. A natural disaster, a gas leak, an earthquake, anything but a giant meat puppet. It would have kept the Master and Servant under wraps, while also covering up the existence of the war.

What shocked Bill the most, however, was that he hadn&#39;t considered those options at all. It wasn&#39;t that he was dumb, nor that he was too reckless to care (liar), but he was currently so enraged that he had neglected to consider the extent of Pyg&#39;s damages.

No. It was Roland who, despite coming in at the last minute and being given a huge burden to deal with, had instantly figured out the best course of action to save not only his own skin, but his master&#39;s as well. The mark of a true servant, one that could not easily be replaced.

To see Roland&#39;s dedication for a job well-done filled Bill with equal parts respect and regret. How could someone so quick on his feet accept servitude so lightly?

Maybe he&#39;d prod...Were it not for Roland&#39;s last choice of words. Any semblance of sanity from Bill&#39;s mind had evaporated, replaced by a beast clawing at a cage.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119045006158733372 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119045006158733372><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:25 PM">6:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Shut yer piehole. Yer little shitstain of a Dowling isn&#39;t even fit to lick my boots!&quot; He snarled, loud enough to agitate Leapfrog. Roland didn&#39;t react, just looking back with a face that encroached between a smile and pity. It ticked him off even further.

-Lachlan had yet to wake up. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119045137021009940 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119045137021009940><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 6:25 PM">6:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">TO BE CONTINUED...</code></span></div></div></div></div></div>
