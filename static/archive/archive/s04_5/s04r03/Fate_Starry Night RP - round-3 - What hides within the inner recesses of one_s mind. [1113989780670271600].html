For someone as talkative as Assassin - if there was anyone to compare in this Grail War, she’d like to meet them - this kind of silence was unusual and foreboding.  James was right to keep silent for the breadth of their trip back, for even if they’ve scored an ally without much trouble, there was about to be some real trouble.  Better save your breath for that.

Assassin had entered first, and between the instances of James turning around to close and lock the door behind them and looking back, she had already sat herself upon the front counter.  She glowered at him, hands gripping the worn overhang and keeping her legs cross.  This position, and her ‘cross’ attitude, called to mind a gargoyle carved into the masonry of an old cathedral.  An unimpressive one, but certainly clear in its warning.

Her mood had been instantly soured earlier and remained at such a low the entire time, so it would be no wonder as to what it was that she was fuming over.  With her sitting there, staring daggers into her Master like that, it was clear that she wanted to talk with him.

Or, perhaps, just stab him.  She’s been very liberal with those knives thus far.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once the door was closed, he dared not go any further than simply turning around to face her. The sight of her gargoyle-like stance told him more than enough; that he isn’t going anywhere without a talk.

“Well, got something on your mind, Assassin?” A decent start. Though, it could be better. Better than nothing, at least.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Assassin spread her legs, leaned forward and perched one arm on her knee, changing from the image of a church’s warding statue to a belligerent street punk.  Her head cocked low, and eyes narrowed.  “Master Rellum, forgive this poor wretch for her grave omittance.  It will be our undoing, what I neglected to teach thee, so pray, harken to my grating tone and sup from my fount of heaven-sent knowledge…”

Then, she leaned her head back, and shouted at him, “YOU ONLY GET THE THREE, YOU CHURLISH, FOUL-MINDED, UNBELOVED <em>FUSTILIARIAN!</em>”  She stood, her hands spread out to the walls as she continued to admonish.  Despite being so small, she was apparently capable of speaking quite loudly.  “They’re as much a leash as a lifeline!  Good, though, you’ve shown me,” she hunched over deeply, “you’ve shown who here gets the leash and should shut up about leashes.  That dog was of no threat to me, and all you did was make me vulnerable.  What modicum of comedy could I take from that old widower of a man that I hadn’t already?!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I know I only get three, Assassin. I still have two.” As if that made things better. “They needed a reason to trust us. That was my reasoning behind it, okay?” James took his stance and stood his ground to defend the choice he made during the encounter with Lancer and his Master. The smudged wing stood as a constant reminder of how it was used, with both parties viewing it differently.

“If it was anyone else, I wouldn’t have made that command. Look, just because you’re a familiar doesn’t mean I am willing to just toss you aside so haphazardly.” So that is how he thought of her, huh? Just another one of his paper butterflies.

In an instant, she was right in front of him, bracing herself arm-and-foot across two display stands, blocking the aisle like some kind of acroatic monkey.  Her mind was set, now: for all the good James had done her, she finally had all reason to give him a real show.  A proper, and absolutely unforgiving show.

“I was prepared to let you off with a bit of fire, but now, after treating me so coldly?  You say that I’m worth preserving, but you call me a familiar.  I am a Servant, a slave, a tool, but you seem to be the true tool here if you can’t realize your foolishness.”  She reached out and jabbed him with a finger to the shoulder, enough to hurt.  “You’re speaking to one of the greatest theatrical minds of all of France, of <em>Christendom,</em> and that’s what you think of me?

“A familiar is summoned to aid the summoner. That is how it works. The quality of the familiar matters very little in this.” James kept his gaze away from his Servant’s own.

‘I would have preferred if you didn’t tell me.’ 

That is what he wanted to tell her, of course. No such words came out of him though. The man before her just stayed silent as her verbal barrage continued.

“Does it matter?” Finally, the man spoke. The answer to her question was left ignored though. Did he even remember it? “What matters is that we survive until the end so we can get our wish.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Your greatest failure wasn’t summoning a weakling, it was summoning a human, someone who wasn’t born intoxicated by their own majesty, or already broken by the horrors of war!”  She dropped to the ground, and her head rolled as she looked up at him, a strange and intimidating glare that carried the same offense as before.

Assassin tried to smile, though with how it skewed off to the side at a precarious angle, it was now plain that she was adopting that mask.  A broken smile.  Grit teeth made to bear pain.  “I hear a meadowlark, crying in this room - because it keeps saying the same things over and over again.  Just the same as a priest cries ‘sin, repent, alms’ or a nobleman shouts ‘make merry, make way’, from thy lips the word ‘victory’ flows endless.

“I have gone and improved our chances. I secured us an Alliance. We have clues on the others in this war because of me. A choice you would’ve had us not make at all.” Like the stubborn old man he is, James stood his ground against Assassin. He knew one attack was all she needed to end him. Unless she wanted to torment him, of course, no way would he be able to use one of his two remaining command seals to defend himself. Maybe he should use another to ensure his safety from her hand…

That thought was pushed aside when the notion was brought up on whether or not his wish mattered. What kind of question is that? Of course it mattered! It was the only bloody reason he was even in forsaken city for!

Slowly, James began to crack. “And I assume you mean to say that yours matters more?” Finally his gaze fell upon her. “Assassin. Show me the wounds Lancer inflicted upon you.” For a few moments he allowed those words to hang before trotting on. “Lancer and his Master made no attempts on your life. Even as you angered what was supposed to be potential allies, they held their hand. So, remind me, where was the danger upon your life there?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her hand reached to point up at her neck, where under the collar of her shirt Lancer had grasped tight, but there were no lasting bruises from that.  She knew as much.  He had only held her up there, threatened to snap her neck, and nothing more.

It was a threat, and a serious one at that, and of course she chose to exacerbate the situation just to be that much more annoying.

What did she get out of that?  Was she seriously in need of some kind of mystic means of avoiding death if it was her own tongue that…

As James asked his second question, his follow-up, his riposte, she smarted at the implication - but at least she had a word in response.  “He had his hand ‘bout my neck like an amorous duke, ready to see head pulled from stump, and…and ‘twas not just the matter of…”

There was no defense to be had here.  They came out of it with an alliance, but it was despite her help, not because of it.  All of this was because of the mire that she waded in, one of her own creation that she never seemed to know how to break out of.

She could say it’s just a matter of pure defense, where if their now-allies really did have any traps in wait for them, she wouldn’t want to be caught unawares.  But they didn’t, and there was nothing hinting that they would.

She could claim it was just the poor luck of her life, where she had to be funny no matter the danger.  Now, though, where she had power over anyone who’d do her harm, immortality even?

If there was an answer to be had, Triboulet didn’t find it before she decided on offense.  And offense, she intended to create.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113990944350539776 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113990944350539776><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 7:42 PM">7:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“What, a wish of a bleeding heart - the sort of thing you’d see inserted into stories with no other option for a better tug at the heartstrings?”  She flippantly ignored his interrogation with the same sort of malicious, predatory grin that she had given to her enemies often before.

She continued, uncaring as to his reaction, moving her hands to and fro in theatrical flourish.  “You so desperately cling to a single life like that, and for what?  How old is she?

He would have enjoyed it much more, if he wasn’t so aggravated, of course. Right now, he just considered Lancer lucky to be able to throttle her. He had no such luxury. Perhaps for the better.

To no surprise to James, she went on the attack after failing to bring up a defence. This rage was different from the one he felt with Ann. This anger was more genuine. 

“Unlike you, I’m not trying to appeal to an audience. I couldn’t give a damn about being original!” For what might be the first time since summoning her, James raised his voice against her. “I wouldn’t expect a familiar to understand the pains of a parent!”

His hands were balled into fists. No swings were attempted though. Just pent up anger was kept instead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

All in contrast to the violent heat of their shouting match, she twirled in place like she was a little kid who simply enjoyed the pain she caused.  Maybe Assassin just lived off of gaiety and spite, like some kind of emotional void.

“Would I not understand that pain?  Would I?  No, I wouldn’t - for I know the pain of a downright <strong>shit</strong> parent when I see one!”  She started to <em>cartwheel</em> down the aisle and away from him, continuing to berate him in the midst of this ridiculous display that brought her closer to the back room.  “Whatever balms you’ve given your dying child, what could soothe the pain of dying alone?

No different than Ruler, James felt the strong desire to deliver a kick to his Servant. Unlike the encounter with Ruler, he was able to hold back these feelings, for now. This was mainly due to the fact that his life would likely end moments after, lest he use another command seal quick enough.

“She isn’t alone.” Unlike his previous words, these ones had less anger behind them. “A dear friend is watching over her for me. He will ensure her last moments, should I die here, are not spent alone. Besides, I told you before, haven’t I?

She danced about the hall, feverishly, energetically, continuing to pick up the pace of her own patter and her steps - the way she looked back at him amid arms-out twirls and acrobatic flips started to seem delirious, lost in a trance of her own hasty and vitriolic make.

“Yes!  You did!”  She slammed against the private room’s door, launching into a somersault with her remaining momentum and launching back up with a cry of “I’m a dullard but not that forgetful!”

“There’ll be no happy end to this story, so why wait?  If all that’s stopping you from going up to meet God is a lack of skill, let this Servant aid you!”  Still spinning madly, she took a sheet from the bed and began to tie knots with it, her hands working at blinding speed.  “I’ve got plenty of experience with the noose, so don’t let your tired old hands keep you from killing yourself!”

She launched into a brief fit of laughter, though its brevity was made up with how rabid it sounded.  A shock of cackling that sounded like it could pierce through the walls and be heard out in the street.  Her face was red, and her eyes swirled in their sockets.  There wasn’t just the question of James’ sanity, but hers as well, by this point.  

Before he could retort, or try and hurt her, or do the smart thing and ignore this insane fool, she snapped out of her sneering to drop the half-made noose and take another thing from him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113991377903177728 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113991377903177728><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 7:44 PM">7:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Oh no, look here!”  She pulled out a familiar stuffed rabbit, worn and well-loved, and held it up like a trophy of war, banging it against the bare bulb ceiling light.  “My Master, the self-appointed grim reaper of this war, has got a little friend with him!

The only sound that managed to slice through this tension-heavy air was the sound of one of his Silver Nails being thrown at her and hitting the wall. The vibrations from the impact extended the lifetime of the sound before it finally died out, returning the room to utter silence. Luckily, it was thrown with the intention to miss and only to send a warning.

“Threaten me all you want, Assassin, but you leave my daughter’s doll out of this!” He held three more Silver Nails in his other hand in between his fingers, acting like make-shift claws which soon began to glow red hot. The murderous intent was clear, even with his dark shades hiding his eyes. This man was willing to throw it all away just to protect what was a keepsake it seems from his daughter. A comfort item, perhaps? Who knows.

“Don’t think I’m afraid of going through this war alone.” One hand held his Silver Nails. The other was held out to show his command seals; his only equalizer between the two of them. ”With so many Masters out there, there is bound to be a Servant or two without a contract. So don’t make me do this.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

…and then she laughed.  Triboulet thought all of this was the funniest thing in the world!

“THAT’S where the line is drawn?!  You’re joking, you must be joking!” She laughed so hard she teetered forward and back, clutching the rabbit tight to her chest.  “I tell thee to fall on your sword, I tell thee to give up your own child, and THE RABBIT’S what gets you furious?  I couldn’t come up with a better joke myself!”

The force of her laughter left tears rolling down her cheeks, and the only reason she let herself stop was because she actually fell flat on her ass from the next peal.  Briefly coming to, her hand snapped to position as fast as a blink.

The knife was against the bunny’s throat.

“You’ll be going forward more alone than you might think.”  She grimaced through her smile to try and contain her laughter long enough to add “Where shall I go first?  The head, the ears?  Oh, what, is it a boy or a girl rabbit - should I make it a gelding?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whoever his neighbours are, blessed be their souls, must either have the patience of a saint or deaf with how loud these two tend to be at times.

The laughter from Assassin was biting and irritating. It was also an opportunity for James to make his move towards her while she was distracted. 

In a quick motion, James reeled back his arm until the hand that held his Silver Nails went over his shoulder. Before he could complete the motion and toss the Nails, he hesitated. The knife was pressed up against the bunny’s neck. Doubts clouded his mind. Was he fast enough to act before the knife made its cut? He wasn’t sure. And that was what made him hesitate. 

“One warning.” Two words came out of a paused James. “That’s all I’m giving you.” The tension kept rising until all these two needed was a single pin dropping to lash out at each other.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“For this, as I am clearly lacking ears to hear with, I shall make my first subtraction from your furry friend:”

“The eyes.”  She winked and stuck out her tongue.

Her wrist snapped upward, bringing the narrow point of the dagger so that it was just stuck under the little bead that made up its dark eyes.  Any deeper and it would’ve severed the string keeping it in place, and any force directed outward would’ve simply pried it off.  The horror of seeing a rabbit’s eyes being stabbed and almost scooped out might be too much to take.

“Do you have any last sights you wish to give?  Perhaps not so <em>violent,”</em> she laughed.  “Sending a rabbit’s vision away with the fright of his dear friend so <em>angry</em> and <em>petulant,</em> that’s no good.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The stage rises above the carpet, separated from the world, and yet intimately accessible by vision and sight alone.  Sight alone brought the mind directly to the side of the performers.

James was the sole member of the audience.  Everyone else privy had seen this play before, thought it droll by now, and thus he had his own show to see, and to be a part of.  He was dressed a genteel man, stockings and fine formalwear, richer than any suit even he had worn.  

The curtain rose.  The space beyond it felt real in a sense beyond mere production; it carried with it a sense of veritableness that prodded the mind into accepting it as reality, casting the space of the theater beyond the stage in a light most fake.  From here, it began:

A hovel.  Architecture warped upward and pinched at the top, laterally constricting, claustrophobic.  Wooden stools and old brickwork.  Tidy, despite it all.  The deep howl of a gale of wind bashing against the window.  Lived in.  A fire cast it all in orange glow.  James, left an observer: he stood and he stared, and the personages within this play paid no heed to him - or perhaps they did, but saw no need to within the context of the script at that moment.

Two players:  a girl, not much older than the one he knew.  Her body twisted and fluttered with the sound of the wind like a candleflame in a breeze.  Her features indistinct, her self shone a white light that existed as a shining comfort to all those who beheld her.

A woman, unfortunately familiar.  Short.  A heavy cloak and hat, both made up of a filthy material that seemed alive in its contortions.  No soul behind the eyes that were the only bright feature of her dark-stained self.

The girl sat beside the woman, running a slight hand down the back of the obscuring cloth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, empty apart from one other.

“So why did you keep at it then?” A simple hard hitting question was asked. The longer they remained here, the more memories James combed through off to the side. Each second meant more of her life was known to him. More of who <em>Triboulet</em> was beyond familiardom. 

With his daughter’s doll safe, James was able to finally breathe and relax a bit. This was because he was in control here, for as long as he kept his own emotions in check, of course.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet walked up the stage and to her own side, though the states of the two were far too different in their dress and mannerism to be mistaken for one another.  The opulent self picked up a piece of wooden debris from the floor, a little knobbed bit of broken-down bedframe, and jabbed it into her prior self’s ribs.  Both of the actors shot her worried glances, but nothing more than that - even if the strange bout of self-harm continued.

All the while, the two continued to recite lines.  That was a good word to use: recite.  The stuff of dreams seemed to make everything “off” by the slightest margin, and the unnatural cadence they took on brought it closer to a script reading than genuine emotion.  The play continued, in the middle of a soliloquy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The actor, looking from behind the wooden facade of the interior, pulled away sheepishly and made herself scarce.  The play continued, Blanche looking toward the sky and beseeching God for His answers.

The director was quick to dismiss her earlier anger and looked back to him, also smoking despite not bringing it up to her mouth.  “That is, indeed, Blanche.  There’s a girl of little renown - kept in her home all but every day for almost 20 years.  What can you expect from someone like that?  Someone who relies entirely on one other person simply becomes an imprint of their mind and personality…” she smirked, “...and boy, what a shitty person to imprint toward.  That Triboulet is a real curr.”

She pulled her pipe, very indistinctly shaped, and tilted her head back to look up at him.  “What interest have you in her, anyway?  She’s merely a vehicle for the tragedy to happen.  Don’t tell me you’re smitten with her.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No.” James got rid of some of the ash that built up before staring at Blanche’s performance again. “Just didn’t take you for the mother type is all.” Although, there was still the matter of why she acted out the way she did despite also being a parent herself. James thought another parent would understand given the situation. 

Perhaps there was something far deeper within…

“Another question, if you would humour me, of course. <strong>What happened to her, Triboutlet?</strong>” Oh, now he remembered her name. How rich. That aside, however, it wasn’t a question that was meant to have its punch pulled back. Something must have happened.

The only option left is death.”

“But, what would be the most heartbreaking death you could think of?  Let’s skip ahead a bit and find out.”

She waved her hand, with her tobacco suddenly having become the familiar felt-headed scepter she was rarely seen without keeping close-by.  There was a brief wave of clattering and the lights strobed in an alternating brilliance and darkness as days passed in the span of seconds, the space of the stage appearing just as real of a dimension as anywhere else in the dream.

“Act Two, Scene Three.  Act Five, Scene Four.  Triboulet, shaken by events we shall return to in time, returns home to find her most beloved daughter, and she consoles her - her very presence does so.  Triboulet, filled with a vim and vengeance fulfilled, drags back a sack and a body to her home, with expectation of finding the noble King Francis the First inside it.”

As she narrated, the scenes emerged and merged.  Overlaid on top of one another, it was as if they were two existences intersecting in three-dimensional space, and they revealed enough truth to make the course of events clear.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113993922096668725 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113993922096668725><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 7:54 PM">7:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The director continued: “Triboulet fears for her life, and for Blanche’s life, and has even sought a blade with which to cut down what she imagines will be the source of her eventual doom: the good King himself, as well as any courtiers who might get too close.  They’ve wronged her in unspeakable ways in the past, but now, there’s something far greater to be lost.  The same time, Triboulet fears no one.  She has had what she imagines as the final laugh, plunged via a knife in the dark twixt the ribs - a culmination of deep paranoia, she returns home with a body, identity unseen.”

The two scenes played over each other, both in the same hovel as before - though by this point, Triboulet was not the same woman seen before.  It must have been some decades since that point, as her face was wrinkled and nowhere near as pristine as it once was, her body was haggard and flabby, her hair was starting to grey and her hunched back was all the more pronounced.  Still, age hadn’t taken with it that unmistakable smile - it was clearly her.  Blanche, likewise, was no child but a young woman at this point.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet, in the shaded layer of the stage, laughed maniacally, much like she had just before they entered the dream.  Vindictive, entirely.  Her voice overlapped that of the earlier scene, but was intelligible all the same.
TRIBOULET: “That bastard…that lusting, imperious, unforgivable menace to all of France…I’ve finally done you in.”  She took her knife and stabbed it into the bag for no other reason than personal enjoyment.  “You thought me a supplicant to your magnanimity?  Some low tart to kiss thy feet, who you could take from freely?  I hope God finds a place for you in the great shithole of Satan’s latrine!

It wasn’t like this was locked away from everyone’s sights. A book, or even some minor research, would have told him all he needed to know about her past. But, it wouldn’t have been authentic. 

Even if she had it portrayed through the use of stage play, it was still her story being played out. That was something no book could capture. Not even if you were right there yourself.

“Assa…Triboulet…” Even if he caught himself, he could not find the right words to say. How could you in this situation? “I’m…sorry.” That was all he could muster as a fellow parent. Even if it was to end his daughter’s suffering, there was no force on this world strong enough to willingly make him end her life.

More words attempted to make themselves known but couldn’t reach far enough to be heard. 

“Who inflicted the curse?” He spoke softly. The truth sat upon the edge of the next scene. However, while he was fully capable of controlling this landscape himself, he gave Triboulet the choice to open the curtains upon the scene or not.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It might have been some figment to facilitate the narrative of a play, or an aspect of her personality, but whether returned or muted she had sunk.

She no longer stood beside him when he looked back, having called her name in earnest this time.  Triboulet sat down in one of the audience’s chairs, palm to forehead and a very uncomfortable look on her face.

“To this day, I cannot decide, Mr. Rellum.”  She winced.  “Was it one man that had done it, as he was the one that spoke the curse into life…or was it me, for pushing him to that point?”

Her head shook, and she rubbed her eye.  “We’ll get to that scene when I’m ready for it.  Just, if you would, tell me now.  Are you ever going to forgive me for that slight towards your own daughter?”

He took a spot on the ground with his back against the stage so they sat across from each other. The cigarette simply refreshed itself and returned back to the length it started when it was lit.

Before he answered a heavy sigh left him as he stared into the sky with his head making a soft thud on the stage. “A part of me doesn’t want to. The other part understands.” He allowed the air to settle around them. A small intermission between the plays being shown. 

“I wouldn’t, if t’were the other way about.”

There was a mutual understanding in those words of hers. Were the tables turned, he would understand her hatred towards him. 

“I won’t pretend to know what being a Servant is like. My actions will likely be forgotten and washed away with time. But, I do know how it feels to be a parent, Tri.” Without realizing just how deep he was getting himself into humanizing his Servant in his eyes, James felt there was common ground to be had between them. 

“So, in a way, I do forgive you.” A slight smirk formed on his face before he spoke again. “We all make bad jokes once in a while, after all.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The lights in the auditorium began to shift - they seemed to grow more distant, or it could be said that the darkened stage seemed to be crawling up behind James.

“It’s fine if you don’t.  ‘Tis the same, either way.  Whether I’m Assassin or Triboulet…or Tri, to you, your disappointment will go away along with me.  That’s just…no, it’s not merely the nature of a Servant.  It’s just my luck.”

By then, there was no theater, no auditorium, and the distinction between the two had vanished along with it.  Now, the world was a brighter gold and whiter marble than before.  Every surface glittered and shone in the light of the interior, were it not covered with gilded paintings of inscrutable shapes.  It wasn’t real, it couldn’t have been reality - this place was too beautiful to have existed on Earth.

To you, welcome to Act One, Scene Three.  Triboulet makes merry, and in turn, brings a terrible curse upon her head…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It ate away at his core from within. It was true. Though, that fact wasn’t much of a secret. He made it pretty transparent that he never wanted to see Triboulet for he lacked the coldness of heart to view her as human at the end.

Even now, despite his best attempts to distance himself from her, he saw just how human she was. Familiar or not, Triboulet was just as much human as he was. 

“I figured it would make it easier, you see…” But, he couldn’t tell the truth, now could he? “If I lost my Servant then I would only lose a Familiar if I kept them as such.” Quite pathetic, honestly.

Then, James allowed the silence to linger for a few moments while he pondered on what he should say next. “I know it won’t make up for treating you like shit but, whenever you choose to be you, and not just some jester, I’ll treat you as such; human.”

“What say you, Tri?” James held out his hand as the trail of smoke from his cigarette snaked its way into the air. A simple offer of a truce in hopes of mending the bridge he sought to sabotage from the start.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the same moment Triboulet was pulled towards James, the theater’s light was gone. The rage from the old man was nothing more than a fleeting nightmare only to be seen in the darkest of times. For the time being, at least, such memories were locked away back where they belonged; in the corner of one’s deepest darkness.

Through those memories, James was able to witness Triboulet’s humanity with his own eyes. Instead of merely a jester, or a tool, James saw a grieving parent who History has mocked and made fun of for their own laughs and amusement. 

A few steps back was done to steady himself after James pulled her from that memory and into another. To replace the theater was endless rolling hills of green. Beautiful, flower-rich fields painted the landscape anew. A massive oak tree stood tall in the distance with what appeared to be an incomplete house woven in between the branches. The skies were a tranquil blue dotted with just the right amount of clouds from either end. A memory James only revealed to one other.

Perhaps his instincts acted upon their own. 

The need to comfort another in anguish was all too familiar to James. So much so that his first thought was of this place.

It was almost two months since he last stepped foot in this memory. Fortunately, everything was right where he remembered it was. At least, anything he did forget about would be picked up on by his daughter if he gets back. If, of course.

As James took in the world around him, he withdrew the arm around her and simply held onto her hand with a gentle grip. It wouldn’t take much to free one’s hand from it, should they want to.

“You know, I almost forgot about this place. It feels like forever since the last time I came here.” He spoke as if reminiscing on one’s glory days.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet didn’t relinquish her own tight grip at first.  She breathed at a frantic pace still, and her whole form was tense, but given time and a bit of peace…she found that it was possible to calm down.

James, and his gentle reminiscence, brought her to a place where she could accept that nothing was going to come after her, or stab her in the back.  For what felt like a long time, she stood there and took in the whole panorama with nothing else to say…

…and then she realized she was still holding his hand tight.  She pulled away and shook it off.  “Aha, yes, forgive me for all but breaking your hand there,” she was quick to fall back into sarcasm.

“The countryside where I grew up. It rarely looks this beautiful on most days but this one day stood out from the rest.” James pinched the cigarette in his mouth before flicking it away. It faded away into the void before it could reach the ground. Apparently this man held a no-smoking rule to himself here. 

The sounds of others with them were faintly present, originating from the oak in the distance. “It’s where I took my daughter whenever she wanted to get out of bed and explore for a bit. I did my best to remember the changes we made to that tree over there for the next time.” The tone James spoke with was mixed with the sweetness of little joy it brought them along with the bitterness of the reality of this being the only way they could.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“A fine day, I suppose.”  Her hands brushed against the breeze and she held one out to feel it.  She made way to the tree. “I suppose you could have anything for yourself in this dream, though.  Fine enough to be the one you always go back to, though?  Ahaha…”

She trailed off, and looked behind her.  Nothing but rolling hills and the picturesque clouds of a blue sky.

“...you’ve got a terrible, frightful tool in those eyes of yours.”

For all the goodness she was being shown, her words were grave.  “If someone has it in them to regret, you’ve got a weapon that I couldn’t ever hope to match.

When I used it on Berserker’s Master, despite seeing events that should’ve left anyone who went through them broken, she refused to break once more after reliving them.” Soon, both of them reached the base of the Oak tree. “If their resolve is strong enough then the past can’t hurt them anymore. Worst case, they get stronger because of their resolve. Thankfully, by then, I can just break the connection before they can do anything.”

The voices became more clearer once they arrived. One of a young girl and the other a far more familiar one. The silhouette of James carried his daughter upon his shoulders while they both worked on a balcony to one of the many sections of the tree house. Their talks of future additions or changes they could radiate an aura of joy that can only come from a child experiencing true happiness.

“Unfortunately, this is no more real than a dream is to reality.” Slowly, the dreamscape around them faded, only to be replaced with a pink bedroom. Plushies and dolls adorn the room in piles. A large bed with an overhanging canopy took centre stage in the room. It had everything a little girl could ask for in a room to herself.

All of that made the frightening amount of medical equipment by the bed used to monitor the little girl laying down all the more stark in contrast. The rhythmic beeps echoed throughout the room.

Both of them were in a peaceful sleep together, dreaming that wonderful dream together to help ease the pain, even if for but a moment’s worth.

Without saying much, James stepped to the side of the bed closest to her so he could brush his hand across her hair. The forlorn smile on his face failed to capture just how much he missed her. How strong the temptation to leave and go back was for him. However, if he did, this would be the sight he would come back to rather than seeing her well again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It’d be hard to lie and say otherwise given just how violently she had reacted at the end.  Triboulet grunted, looked away, and gripped her upper arm.  She was supposed to be resilient…

Taken along with James to the side of the tree, she looked around, the edge of all of this washing away with the sight.  As was now clear, Triboulet never had the chance to give Blanche this life, nothing more than what she could do within the confines of a small, urban house in Paris.  She watched quietly, craning her neck around to see the bounds of the tree-borne house (what a novel idea…) and trying to get glimpses of the dream of the girl.

Though this was just a dream.

The reality was sadder, and as Triboulet stood both beside her Master and over his shoulder, she felt…sympathy.  “I’ve got a…familiar feeling, seeing this.”  She moved past him and looked closer at her sleeping face, melancholy on her own.  “To care for someone who can’t leave on their own.  I’ve…well…there’s still regrets about how I handled mine, and whether she still could’ve lived a pleasant life…a blind man could tell that’s what I felt, eheh…”

“...what’s her name?  This little…owner of a certain, notorious rabbit.”  She tried to smile and give a little levity to all of this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

On the nightstand closest to her, well within arm’s reach to be held whenever, was the notorious rabbit himself alongside a cute depiction of a frog posing as a knight. “She gave me him to keep so that he could watch over me to make sure I was safe during my trip. I suppose it worked in a way, I’m sure it would have been my eye instead if she didn’t.” Even they were separated from each other from the looks of things. At least one stayed behind to watch over Aveline while the other did the same for James. 

“You tried your best. As a parent, that’s all you can do.” James stared down at the Servant at his side with a faint smile. This was likely one of the few times they could share a glance together without shades impeding them in any way, shape, or form. “Nothing you could have done against a curse, after all.” And yet, this man was attempting the same with a sickness that seemed insurmountable.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her mood darkened for a moment before she worked to dismiss the thought of what-could-have-been, and keep a smile on in the girl’s presence.

“Quite a perverse way of protecting you.  I…can’t say I know for sure if I was prepared to end you right there.”  That’s honestly better than being certain about it.  Small victories.  “I think I just wanted to see you livid.  You’re a hard man to crack, and this comes from someone who’s nothing short of unparalleled in the field!”

Standing over the girl’s bedside, she looked down at her and, briefly, nostalgia for the same days of doting on her own little girl came up.  She really was all that she cared for in life after everything else had failed her…and in a way, though roundabout, this would be her own means of caring for her.  This war.  Murder and violence and degradation.

To think of the limit that James had already steeled himself for, as a parent willing to do anything.

…this does bring a question.  She looked up from her.  “Her mother’s…been gone for some time, then.  ‘Twas you and her, not the three of you, making that house in the tree.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A melancholy expression overtook his face as he sighed. His gaze went back to his daughter. “Yeah…”

It took some time before James could bring himself to say anything more. One can deduce all they needed from that one response though.

“My wife, Ava, didn&#39;t survive the childbirth. Something about complications. I couldn’t remember.” Some memories are better left forgotten, even from those with the power to relive them. “I’m not sure if she would’ve preferred Aveline being named after her but it was the best name I could think of at the time.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet waited for him patiently, and in turn, he would have to wait for her.  She sat at the edge of the bed and let the nostalgia, concern and contemplation play across her face.

“This all has been…quite something, James.  A day where I’ve had a good deal of pain played upon me, and in turn, some…real pain played by my hand.  Let it never be said that I am anything but masochistic.”  She chuckled and smiled, before trailing off.  A hand ran through her hair, and her smile was lost.

“I still had so many jokes for that dog.”

Her head hung low, and with some difficulty, she mustered the words she wanted to say.  “I…propose a trade, my Master!  I can’t promise it’s fair or balanced, but it will be my only offer.  What I want is this:  I…need a day off.”

This was quite the ask.  There could be only a few days left in this war for all they knew; there were only hints and guesses to tell them how many of their opponents were left.  Could a single day be given?

“I’ve got nothing left in me.  You’ve shown me a good thing at that end, this was good,” she held out her arms to the room, “but also just…a bit painful, no?  Bittersweet.  You’d have a Servant with not a single joke and a dulled mind if I don’t get some time.  And…well, I still have my little goals.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113996795593363577 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113996795593363577><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 8:05 PM">8:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“In return…”

She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, placed her hands on her knees and braced herself, for what she was going to say was quite the admission to make.  “...when I…make humor, this isn’t something I always feel like I <em>have control over.</em>  It sounds like an excuse for a right bitch to continue being such, I know, and sometimes I feel like that’s all it is.  But when you are someone like me…where the only difference between standing with the elite and hanging with the common criminals is the need to be constantly, <em>horrifically derisive of everyone you can see…”</em>

“...it comes...it <em>becomes</em> natural.  Please, when I can’t catch myself doing it at the wrong time, try and catch for me.  I will do what I can to cease.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No pressure or eyes were set upon her. He merely just kept his gaze upon his daughter. While he could easily spend as much time with her in his dreams as he can, he knew it would only weaken his will to stay. Nothing could compare to seeing the real deal, even if it pained him to see her suffer. But, seeing her rest so peacefully was just enough for him. A reminder of what he was fighting for.

Then her proposal came.

“A day off?” The war could very well be over in a day. They could also miss an opportunity to strike at one of their targets as well. Time was a precious resource that neither side could ill afford to lose, despite that, though…

“Sure.” The landscape around them slowly began to erode and return to the empty void they first fell into. “A day sounds fair to me. I can use that to try and make sense of some of the clues and track down our next target.” When the dream version of his daughter faded with the pleasant smile on her face is when he turned to face Triboulet. 

“Although, I might have my work cut out for me if I have to catch every single one of your bad jokes, Tri.” The slight smirk showed that this man had some inkling of humour inside of those old bones. At least it wasn’t some kind of dad joke. 

With that, James held out his hand once more as the last bits of the world flew up into the air. An agreement to the deal she offered. “Shall we wake up then or do you still wish to remain dreaming, even if it’s for a little while.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet laughed at someone else’s humor for a change.

Her wish granted, reprieve soon to be hers, she felt comfortable enough to laugh.  James…well, there was no doubt that he had seen far worse in these dreams, so the ease with which he did this was not a surprise.  Triboulet had just walked out from something that she didn’t want to have shared, though, and to be honest?  She wanted to laugh.

There’ll be time to cringe and to mourn later, in the waking life.  A moment’s levity was needed, and at that moment, James Rellum served as her own jester.

“You’ll keep up, good sir, or you’ll find yourself in far worse trouble than what landed us in this mess.  Or is your wit’s speed only matched by the creakiness of those old joints?”

Taken from the bedroom and returned to the liminal space between dream and reality, Triboulet coasted to his side.  “Let’s get up.  I’ve slept for too long.  Any more and our enemies will chance upon me with a stuffed rabbit in my arms.”

She took his hand with little hesitation, and waited to go on up.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Life in denial was something he was fine with if he could ignore getting old as long as he could!

“Alright then. Let’s wake up…” His last sentence faded into an echo as a bright light overtook both of them until even they were gone from this world, leaving behind nothing left but the memories they made while inside. 

Then, both of them returned to the room prior to the activation. James, having been experienced in this, woke up much quicker. With his shades already back on his face, and his Silver Nail gone from his hand, James sat with his back against a small cupboard where he was when he used his Mystic Eyes on Triboulet. His knee was up so his arm could rest upon it.

“Enjoy your day off, Tri. Just be safe, alright? I’ll try and do the same.” James spoke with a soft smile on his face. The sag in his shoulders told as much as one needed of the strain those eyes had on his body, especially after showing so many different memories. Perhaps entering a Servant’s mind took more out of him than it would with anyone else.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When she did, she found herself in the much more undignified position between the two.  Half-slumped against the bedside, sprawled out, and just like she imagined, she was clutching onto the rabbit tightly.

It was quickly placed back where it belonged, lest James take offense and they have to repeat this whole mess again.

Tired in a way she didn’t imagine a Servant could feel - mental fatigue had plagued her often, but not physical - she stretched long and wide as she got up.  Meeting James’ eyes, she tried to match his smile, but couldn’t.  “I’ll hold you to it,” she pulled her gaze away.  “You’ve seen what I’m like scorned, so you know better than to risk it.”

She wouldn’t leave right away, not for some time, but she did take her leave of him.  Triboulet stood up and walked to the door, and after some internal deliberation, quietly said “Thank you for understanding.”

Assassin hoped he understood.  Even if it was just the slightest connection, that they were parents of a confined child, it was all she could ask for right now.  She knew that she had wronged him, and mostly, she wouldn’t let herself rest easily.

Rest…

<em>God, she needed rest.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>
