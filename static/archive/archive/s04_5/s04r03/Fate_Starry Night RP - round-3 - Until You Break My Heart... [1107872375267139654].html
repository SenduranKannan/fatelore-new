This was for a multitude of reasons. Certain people did not experience death very often throughout their lives. For some, it was the death of loved ones, but nothing beyond that. The stench of death is divisible into three categories: rot, sickness, and bloodshed. Rot was what happened when Illyn lacked access to IBM, so he simply stuffed a corpse into the trunk of his car until he could get access to one. Sickness was what happened to Illyn’s father. At the end of his life, the rot of septic infection was distinct and palpable. When Illyn left that hospital room, his heart died completely. It is truly painful to watch the slow rot of someone you love.

Bloodshed is what happens when the bag that is the human body is cut, and the water within spills out. This was the worst of the three. Rot was avoidable. Sickness confined to hospitals. Bloodshed got into clothes, seats, and anything of value that Illyn had on him, with the exception of IBM.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107872515801481256 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107872515801481256><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:29 PM">10:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>IBM simply swallowed the metallic scent. It was a proverbial void that treated all death equally. There was no random chance in regards to what happened to dead bodies with IBM. They all simply vanished and were swallowed up.

Illyn’s clothes were covered in blood. The seats of his car sucked in the metallic stench and produced it. The red liquid congealed in his hair, and Illyn wrinkled his nose in discomfort. It was not an emotion, but a reaction. Yes, just a reaction.

It was the only expression that Illyn made as Rider drove the two home from the fight from Berserker. Firetrucks and police cars passed their car on the way to the scene. There would be no witnesses, and several missing persons reports would be filed. For both the Benerice Police Department and Illyn, it was a spectacular failure. Berserker had escaped, Rider had to face his steed getting eaten before him, as well as witness for the first time that his Master was an absolute monster. 

There were moments before where it was possible, but fate had made sure to keep Rider unaware of Illyn&#39;s activities. The child in the park that had followed Illyn was swallowed by IBM, and never returned to their parents.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107872525003796601 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107872525003796601><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:29 PM">10:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Driving home was awkward. The tension was palpable. Illyn waited for a blade from Rider to cleave into his throat. Illyn silently kept his Command Spell on standby. Who was faster: Kalki or Illyn? Perhaps it was best to not find out. Nonetheless, Illyn waited. He waited some more. He blinked. He continued waiting.

Yet no blade ever came.

Eventually, after arriving safely at Illyn’s home, Illyn checked IBM. “You will be cleaning this car tomorrow. This is a company car, and I expect it to be spotless.” Illyn said, as if the deaths of innocents was nothing more than a mild inconvenience to maintain his secrecy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107872572332326992 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107872572332326992><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:30 PM">10:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="nimbuss_">@Nimbus</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were many things to think about, from the corpse who had been charred, to the littering of bodies that now were in the maw of IBM, everything about today had left the incarnation in a torpor he felt was almost impossible to get out of. His mind continued to visit that same scene, how he had seen such a Mephistophelian device simply take bodies as if they were nothing. The fact that such a tiny device sat behind them in the car and yet took up most of the atmosphere was suffocating on its own. 

Occasionally, the Rider would look at the man who claimed to be his master, his brown eyes hidden beneath his bangs and yet imaging what could happen next. Just like Illyn, the idea of Kalki manifesting his sword to cleave cleanly through his neck was something that entertained the man’s mind. Would he have bled the exact same way those bodies before had, mangled and grim? Would his blood bleed black, ink on the page of the world to show how inhuman he had been? He couldn’t tell. Yet, something in his mind told him he simply needed to have his metal kiss flesh to find out. . . 

When they returned to Illyn’s home, the scent of fresh air was almost as chilling as before. Like bleach on a bloody floor, he could erase the presence and yet not the memory. He hadn’t taken a good look at the device, but now, as Illyn hauled it inside, the sleek look of it was almost disturbingly alluring. Had such infernal devices looked so plain? In his legends, those who were evil had gone and turned monstrous in appearance, and yet to Kalki, IBM looked as if it were nothing of the sort.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107872897646735420 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107872897646735420><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:31 PM">10:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>To their own surprise, the first things were said. And yet, it was a demand to clean up the mess that Illyn had made. Kalki turned to him once more, this time, his face just as bleak and dead. 

“What was that back there? That obscene display you happened to be doing? Tell me, you are no worse than the damn Berserker are you? I will not – no, cannot – allow myself to help you with this.” 

The questions were loaded and ready, each one aimed directly for answers and would be repeated until Kalki felt they were sufficient. He looked at the car, back how the blood had splattered about the seat. He couldn’t do it. To clean it up meant he’d be an accomplice to such a filthy hobby of his master’s. He waited for a second, his patience thin and taunt. Had the man not answered in time, Kalki’s once demanding voice grew agitated.

<strong>“Answer me Illyn.”</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107872932623028254 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107872932623028254><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:31 PM">10:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Mystic Code known as IBM hung from Illyn’s hands, exuding the noxious presence that disgusted Rider. Illyn turned back to his Servant, and cocked his head.

“<strong>How dare you.</strong>” IBM dropped to the ground with a metallic clang as Illyn pointed his finger towards Rider. “You compare me to that Berserker? It is my obligation as a magus to make sure that Magecraft remains secret. That <strong>I</strong> remain secret. Do you understand what that means? As long as I’m alive, people will never stop hounding me. Those people who I placed within my life’s work? They were not the first. Their bodies are stored, then I can copy them as I see fit. I was simply being efficient when I killed those people. You are my Servant. I command, and you obey. Do your job, and don’t talk back to me.”

Illyn walked to the edge of the porch, where he stared directly at Rider. His eyes were pits. Hollow and sunken. Whatever life that had been in them had been squeezed out long before Rider was ever summoned.

“What did you think this war would be? Some honorable story where people fight with shining armor? Life is cruel. It is unfair. It is <strong>unpredictable.</strong> Yet all you can ever babble about is your wheel and how it will improve everything.”

The laugh that echoed from Illyn’s mouth was cold.

“<strong>Then where was it when I needed it?</strong>”

Kalki shouted back, his face torn between anger and concern. This man. . . This man thought that because of his situation, this was the solution? This was the exact opposite. Illyn may have said that he commanded him, but Kalki stayed back in defiance. He knew his place as a servant, but he was no butler to crime. He was Vishnu’s avatar, Preserver God’s final welcoming to humanity before it would change its course back. Illyn? He was but a mortal, nothing special to him but the fact that he had learned the arts the gods had bestowed him, and even now he used such a thing for heinous deeds. 

“Your deeds are to be fixed by yourself! Are these people not after you because of this? You commit a crime and expect to not be admonished for it? You are a fool to think I’d follow you. You’ve dug your own grave.”

In Illyn’s display of anger –If one could even call such a calm look on his face one at all– he moved towards the porch, questioning the Rider’s mindset of the war and its entirety. But Kalki knew how wars would go, he would fight many in the future, but that did not mean he would be some tyrant on the battlefield. Wars were fought with benevolence and dignity, there was no benevolence or dignity in this! And for him to besmirch the wheel because <strong>he</strong> couldn’t understand it, the rider this time manifested his sword out of anger and slammed it into the ground, his neck bulging out as he bellowed a reply.

“Speak not of what is unpredictable you damn fool. The wheel is exactly what it is, fair and unpredictable. That is what life is! <strong>You</strong> are not to sway it, for there is already a path predetermined for those who are unwilling to learn. You speak of breaking something you truly do not understand and yet you argue with someone who does?! Tell me, what has happened to you that you can so easily boast is worth changing the very way the world works as we speak? <strong>Out with it!</strong>”

“Ha.”

“<strong>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</strong>” Laughter rang out loudly from Illyn’s mouth, though it was stiff as stone. He blankly stared at Rider.

 “Because my wife is dead. Was her death part of your ‘fair’ path, Rider? Is unpredictability fair?”

Illyn’s voice was quiet. His mechanical expression was in direct contrast to Rider’s. He was a thinker. Kalki was a doer. Everything that Illyn did was for research, to fulfill the contract that he had made long ago, even if he could no longer remember it.

“Was it to <em>test</em> me? To test them?” Illyn’s expression flickered. “You cannot understand. You will never understand. Our fates should be determined from the moment we are born. But really, how could you understand, coming from a future that is not yet set in stone? Because it is unpredictable?”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107873251595653220 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107873251595653220><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:32 PM">10:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“People are simple creatures.

Ask them to gamble away their life on everything, and they buckle under the pressure.” Illyn shrugged. “Only when our backs are to the wall and when there is no other choice. <strong>That is when we embrace randomness.</strong>”

Displaying a rare moment of emotion, Illyn clawed at his face. Yet his expression refused to change. It was positively unnerving to see somebody perform such an emotional action without the slightest hint of emotion. Illyn’s body remembered how to feel, but Illyn himself did not.

“My wife…” Illyn’s voice broke. “My child that I’ll never see or know anything about. Do you know that I can’t even tell you what they look like anymore? I have fed my heart and soul into my work: into <strong>IBM.</strong>”

Illyn’s face reddened as he screamed at Sri Kalki, getting directly into his face as he walked down the porch.

“<strong>I wake up every day, and every time I look back... There is less of me there each time! I don’t remember anything. Yet I persist. I work. I push Magecraft further than anyone at Atlas or the Clock Tower. You want me to learn?</strong>”

Illyn cackled again as his vacant eyes stared into Kalki’s soul.

“<strong>I have been learning for my ENTIRE LIFE!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Martinson, he could say that he felt there had to be something gut wrenching to many. His laughs felt unhinged, his questions directed not to him but some higher power that he could have thought would answer it, even with his name on it, Kalki felt he answered for someone else. 

Something about how the scenario felt familiar, people pleading to the gods to alleviate them of their issues, to understand and glean at the knowledge that the gods hoarded with them. 

<em>My child is sick. . . Please share your knowledge, Dhanwantari.</em>

<em>Our village. . . Annapurna, bless us with your golden ladle.</em>

<em>Lord Ganesha, what must I do to get rid of my competitors for our business to grow. . .</em>

While he hadn’t heard them himself, the prayers had often felt quite familiar. Everything was asking to be given. <em>Give</em> them knowledge to help the sick. <em>Give</em> then the chance to taste from the golden ladle. <em>Give</em> them ways to defeat their enemies. Was Illyn’s another example of such? To give him his deceased wife back? He couldn&#39;t tell. 

“It is to test humanity itself. You say you wish for consistency but had everything stayed stagnant and repetitive, there would be no progress. Your use of randomness is something that makes your lives both a large blessing and a large curse, unlike a cat and dog. With people, randomness brings a sense of understanding. You understand that life is not something you can control, that death happens as the god’s whimsy, you learn that things are but courses you are accepted to take and that the truth is, you should be happy whatever situation you are in.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107873388258676756 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107873388258676756><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:33 PM">10:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Kalki’s words were kurt and short sliced through whatever Illyn spouted, his theories and opinions on what the world felt like nothing but a madman’s dribble to the Rider’s ears. He made excuses, humans would want things that convinced them, but life was nothing of the such. Convenience led to vice, vice led to sin, sin led to death as well. 

Illyn’s voice cracking however, did put a moment of pause on the man though, the Rider had been so angry before he could only stare at Illyn’s body, his face obscured by the Rider’s black lashes, but to hear such a weakness, he couldn’t help but look up in a way to show he too listened, but he wasn’t oe to back down from such. His master’s face a bright red, Kalki could count each indent his fingers made into his skin, and when he was in full view, Kalki felt a wave of guilt and yet unresolved anger rise in him. Before he could yell, he caught himself, letting himself choke on the words he felt would have shattered anyone’s spirit as his gaze went back to the floor.

Rider’s face felt tired, as if the muscles in his skin felt the need to sag, adding an ample amount of years to his once youthful and charming features. Now, he feels older, as if the years came and swept him away all at once, leaving his face ragged and gritty. The incarnation grabbed his sword and watched it dematerialize, sighed, and moved away, walking into the home of the mage, his face watching the ground as he muttered to himself. Whatever it was, he kept quiet to keep from Illyn’s reach.

For a moment, his heart remembered how to feel things. Illyn was a machine. Every day, a little less of him remained. He was eroding away into dust, yet he could not falter.

He wanted to kill his Servant. He utterly longed to do it. Yet that would be a waste of resources. It would be inefficient. Kalki had value as something to be analyzed by magi, and so he could continue to breathe.

“<strong>Then what is this on my hand?</strong>” Illyn’s voice rang out from behind Rider. He flexed his command spells. “One word, and your existence ends. No trial, no tests, no will of god. What of the summoning ritual that brought you into this world by chance? Who was that testing? Me?”

Blinking once as he calmed himself, Illyn shook his head. “No, I am an alchemist from Atlas who develops things. Trust me when I say that mechanically, all Servants are the same. <strong>You could be some other Servant, and I would not give a damn.</strong>” Illyn said truthfully. “I think it was a test of <strong>you.</strong>”

Illyn pointed a marked hand towards Kalki.

“<strong>And what need is there to test a god?</strong>”

So, this was how low his own master had stooped to. Kalki’s eyes were stationed forward and unfazed, turning around to get a glimpse of the command spells that Illyn boasted so proudly. 

“Then use them. If you are so hellbent on assuring me that you do not have much of a need for a servant, you can easily do so. Do it then!”

He could see the crimson engravings that etched itself onto the master’s skin, the pattern of a beautifully drawn yet used for deadly intent. It was a sick irony. Illyn’s ramblings went on, Kalki steeling himself so he did not act irrational, these were volatile moments, both of them, and he knew anything could have caused anything from Illyn. And yet, part of him nearly goaded his body to test what could happen.

“You act as if you had some sort of control on such a summon, do you think Anubis would come and help you? The Egyptian God of the Dead? You have nothing you could truly offer such a thing, and yet here you are, to act as if you are not blessed enough to be standing and not cleaved in two by any one’s servant or your own. This is not a test for me, this is what life would have happened if I’m summoned by some crank who wishes to get his wife back, or some moron who knew nothing of the consequences. Unlike you, I am destined for such, my coming is foretold regardless, you only expedited the process! So go ahead, use them Illyn! I urge you to! You only slow something you wouldn’t be able to control anyways!”

What? “Before you were summoned, I spoke to a woman about the importance of wishing. She asked me what I was going to do with my Servant. Do you know what I told her?”

“<strong>I told her that I would kill the Heroic Spirit if they had no value.</strong>” Illyn looked at Kalki, as if answering an unseen question: <em>Then why aren’t you doing it?</em> “Because I only needed one thing from them: their power. I need no Holy Grail. You might be right about Anubis. You might not be. An alchemist expects all possible variables. That question that you are raising means nothing to ‘me’ because ‘I’ am not being faced with that question. Anything regarding Anubis should be left to the potential version of ‘me’. Not ‘me’ as I currently exist. Just as when ‘I’ summoned you, I did not entertain the notion that you would discover my plans.”

Illyn pulled up a chair and sat down. IBM converted itself into its smaller form right before Rider’s eyes. It folded into itself like origami as Illyn placed it in his lap. 

“If Anubis had not done what I asked, I would have copied his mind using a command spell, before ordering him to automatically erase his mind each time he failed to answer my command.” Illyn coughed to himself. “I would then use my device to project his mind back into his body. It would be a cycle. Eventually, Anubis’s mind would degrade over time. He would bend to my wishes. Or he would not. That’s what the third command spell is for.” 

Kalki would feel his skin crawl as he envisioned a constant cycle of life and death in servitude to Illyn.

“Besides. <strong>It’s what I deal with everyday.</strong>”

Kalki felt his words were a hard truth, something he had realized could have been some sort of truth for the situation. This rider was stubborn if anything, seeing how Illyn’s past promises and repetitions of old threats meant little to him now. 

However, what he had said after unnerved the servant fully. The box he carried had been something he felt was already a blight on the world for what it had done previously to those innocent people, but hearing what Illyn would do to failed attempts and what it could do to him, something about it made his face waver.

“You’re sick, do you know that? Is that what you are doing to those people? Feeding them to this. . . this <em>demon</em> and having them copied for your sick wish? Have you fed yourself willingly to this?”

There it was, a creak in his voice to show the way the idea of it was just twisted enough to where he felt something about this entire thing crack beneath him. This bastard wouldn’t dare would he? To take a servant’s mind away with such a dastardly device was almost as twisted as any other thing he could have concocted. Kalki balked, a piece of him blanching at the idea of it all.

From my calculations, it is 97.45% likely that I have done so multiple times, even though I do not remember it. Minds are harder to copy than bodies.” Illyn said casually, his indifference to the potential of being a replica was shocking. “Servants are the same. Aren’t you all copies of the original hero? It came up in my research of the Holy Grail War.”

The man clenched his fist, causing the command spell to ripple slightly.

“This existence is pain. And yet…”

“<strong>I would not take it back.</strong>” Illyn pointed at Rider. “That is what makes us different. I would endure everything to fulfill my goals. In that way, we are kindred spirits, marching towards a grand vision we do not understand. Your <em>wheel</em>?” Illyn said the word with a sneer. “You might call me a demon, or a monster, or an inhuman fiend. Sticks and stones. Your wheel will preserve the status quo, yet what if the status quo were to change? The wheel would preserve that as well.”

“I copied them and replicated them at first… to fine tune Internal Brain Manifestation’s mind transferring capabilities. After that, I used people to see what would happen to transferred minds. I don’t kill people for the fun of it. They aren’t even really people, if that puts your mind at ease. They’re just echoes in a cave or shadows cast on a wall.” 

“So I will keep going.” 

“I will use as many people as needed in order to push magecraft forward in order to bring my wife back. I will destroy unpredictability if that’s what it is needed to <strong>keep her here</strong>. If I need to destroy the Holy Grail, you, or anyone else…”

Illyn shrugged.

“<strong>So be it.</strong>”

For a moment there, emotion almost flooded back, embers igniting a facial feature or two from the incarnation before dying at the precipice.

“You need to give up trying to change something outside of your scope. There is nothing that can be done about your wife, no matter what you may try. For all you know, she could already have found her truth, set off the course of reincarnation.”

With it, the Rider turned back away, ready to head towards the mango groves that had been exactly where he was first summoned, silence followed behind him thankfully. He needed it anyways, the events had drawn so much out of him and he had nothing to give more towards the subject. Maybe he should have meditated, talked to the former god inside him and asked for guidance on such a difficult task. Yes. . . Maybe he should have meditated for a moment.

No. You killed indiscriminately. You do such and then claim you are so consistent. . . When really, you’re nothing more than a hypocrite who preaches lies of dreams that would never be achieved.”

He had taken to a halt at the back door, his gaze not even meeting the Magus at all anymore. Kalki took a breath, shook his head and continued forward, this time to leave Illyn with the machine that he had relied on. 

<em>Ah, Lord Vishnu, I hope that you hear what I had to say and would watch for this world once it goes into the new era. . . Maya has become something that clouded the judgment of the people here, and now many find themselves so deep in their sickness that it plagues them every day.</em>

The prayer was solemn and silent, a wish that he knew would only befall onto his own shoulders. Lord Vishnu had left this world for the moment, and remained inside him. He was speaking to himself. With it, the atmosphere would never leave the man inside the home, its tension gone even with his servant away from him. For a second there, Kalki was beginning to meditate, his body getting ready to get back into his daily pose so he could focus on the next step of getting the world on its track. . . But even when he was about to close his eyes, he could feel Illyn’s stare on him. Their gaze was a heated accusation that was nearly tangible on his skin.

I need to think.”

Illyn’s thoughts were rapid and multi-faceted. Atlas alchemists were capable of dividing their thoughts into different rooms in order to increase calculation speed. By squaring those rooms, Illyn was capable of thinking at the same level as a computer. Due to their connection, even Rider felt an obscene rush of data as Illyn digested Kalki’s claim.

It was enough information for the Servant to drown in. Flashes of faces, dates, ethnicities, races, professions, and all data regarding each person Illyn had ever killed was flashing through Illyn’s eyes, and Rider was experiencing the runoff.

This was just the runoff? The information was enough to make Kalki’s head hurt.

Millions of thoughts surged through Illyn’s head as he considered Kalki’s claim. The Servant was false. All it knew was self-righteous prattling about its own ideals while claiming good over evil. Yet there was one absolute law that plagued Atlas whenever a theory originating in the Clock Tower or from a third-rate magus was correct:

A broken clock is right twice a day.

“<strong>No…</strong>”

Information continued to erupt as Illyn referenced everything. An algorithm of thought formed itself in Illyn’s mind in order to reference every single person that Illyn had killed. Illyn’s targets were specific. They were deliberate. It was very rare for Illyn to walk down the street and decide that somebody had to die.

And yet…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107874921104810044 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107874921104810044><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:39 PM">10:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He had killed several taxi drivers from all over the world by simply calling up the taxi company. They had likely been on staff alongside several other coworkers all at once. Individual chance of death? The mental algorithm finished: 12.5%

What about calling that specific taxi company? The number lessened even more. 

“<strong>No…</strong>”

And Theo? What of that man that Illyn killed before the Holy Grail War? He had been an intentional pick. He fulfilled all the parameters required for Illyn to kill him. What of that child that Illyn had copied using IBM? What of everyone?

That driver who killed ■■■■■■ had not been random. That was a deliberate act done by a deliberate choice. Illyn had deliberately crushed the life from his body on his own. Same with his mother. When she chose to abandon everything for her work, he had separated it from her. That was <strong>warranted</strong>.

For everyone else…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107875140060053534 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107875140060053534><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:40 PM">10:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Oh god. <em>He</em> was the drunk driver that took ■■■■■■ away, just for everyone else. All those nameless relatives of those Illyn killed... They didn’t know that it was deliberate. They didn’t…

“<strong>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!</strong>” Illyn fell to his knees and screamed. He covered his ears and closed his eyes. He didn’t want to hear anything. He didn’t want to experience anything. Yet he had to accept that his goal had been noble, but it had come at the cost of creating Illyns across the globe.

Several had to go, but many infinites had perished for the same reason that she did.

■■■■■■.

What was her name, again? It did not matter.

After a few moments, Illyn stood to his feet. His eyes were glass. He stared at Kalki with his haunted eyes, and he held out his hand. “My goal was not wrong. It is a noble goal. Therefore, it is just to continue moving forward with the great experiment of RE:VIVAL.”

“<strong>It is finally time for you to fulfill your purpose for summoning. I spit on the Holy Grail. It is a worthless trinket barely comparable to the works of Atlas.</strong>”

“<strong>By my command spell, I order the Rider-class Servant known as Kalki…</strong>” 

Illyn pulled out IBM, now in the form of a Sony Walkman. Its presence unnerved Kalki and seemed to mock his very soul. Yet to Illyn, it was everything. This revelation meant much, but the goal was still just. The research Illyn had done was still just. He was a Seal Designated magi, and he would not bend from his goal so easily.

Kalki waited for the order: <em>To kill himself.</em> Instead, he heard something through his mental link with Illyn. <em>Sorry.</em>

“<strong>...to listen to my song. Upload your mind into IBM, Sri Kalki. Become the next step in my experiments.</strong>”

The room erupted into a red light as a command spell was used. The device known as IBM beeped to life, and Kalki heard a song. 

“<em>Stop! In the name of love…!</em>”

He couldn’t turn to him now, show the way his eyes lost their light when he heard of the things his master confessed to so easily. No. . . He couldn– The thought wasn&#39;t finished before a searing pain shot through him. Images of places, faces, and deeds roared before him as a movie at full speed. A blonde woman during her stroll, a man mere hours of his summoning, they all bled together in a series of features, eventually till faces became unrecognizable. How many had he killed? <em>How many had suffered at his hand?</em>

“<strong>RAAAAAAAAAHGHHHHHH!</strong>” 

Kalki tried to take a breath, though it felt as if his lungs had stopped working during such a thing. Each photograph of a person taking what little oxygen he had kept in him, till he felt himself ready to heave over. Sweat began to perspire, god how it dragged on, the man tried to steady himself, but even in that he felt the world tilt over. 

A woman appeared in his blurred sight, a repetition of her being hit by a car that felt too fast, a hand not his own outstretched but he wasn’t sure if he were reenacting such or if it were something his mind had simply created to torment him. What was her name? He could hear something of it, and yet each time he found himself trying to utter it it felt like he slurred the name to be inconceivable.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107875347812327506 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107875347812327506><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 10:41 PM">10:41 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Was this the wife he had seen? Was this the wife that death would have caused the string of murders? Her image cleared, yet with the crispness of such in his head, a static took over behind her, blurring her face. Illyn’s suffering only enhanced it, with the woman clear in his face she too began to fade away with the throes of her husband’s panic. Her face warped and swayed more, and soon when he felt his brain feel as if it were to be torn in half, she was gone entirely. Then there was silence. A white silence that had consumed the Rider’s mind and hearing. His sight glazed over with what felt like the sting of bitter tears, only the echoes of what had been Illyn’s distorted voice being caught in the midst of it. He couldn’t tell exactly what he heard, but his body filled in the blanks with how his lips moved. Kalki. Order. <em>Kill yourself.</em> He hoped that would be the end of it all then. His sight went white to match the other senses. 

He couldn’t tell exactly when he had found himself walking back, what had caused him to do such without much of a fight, or even when the headphones nestled into his ears. . . But his vision cleared with the feeling. His eyes gravitated to the strip of the command seal that faded to a pale red, Illyn’s hand missing one of the three from before. This bastard. THIS BASTARD. 

The Rider’s lips tried to move, but the curl of them was evident but yet they never opened. But, to add to the hellish mind Illyn suffered through, right before the music cued up, right before the beginning of the Internal Brain Machine could work, was a voice with a hatred like no other, but it didn&#39;t yell. . . No, the worst part of it all was the calmness it had with it. For Illyn, it’d be the last moment he’d hear before the chorus began.

<em>You welcomed insanity. Insanity.</em>
