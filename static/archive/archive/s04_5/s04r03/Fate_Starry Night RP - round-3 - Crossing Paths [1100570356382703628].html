There hadn&#39;t met any other master- servants pairs in the past few days but that actually worked in her favor. 

While she and Saber had already talked about it she was still really concerned about the rise in death in this island. So on the past few days they had slowly been following the trail of one of this killers, as she assumed that they were also enemies that meant that killing them was like killing 2 birds with one stone. Still if there was any sort of silver lining in this whole situation was that due to all the deaths people was no longer leaving at night, It was an understandable response, against an unknown danger all they could was to refuge themselves in a place where they could feel safe.

Sadly this didn&#39;t apply to everyone, regardless of how dangerous it may look there would always be some which were either too brave or stupid to understand the real danger. Well not always, sometimes it would be something akin to 

<em>&#39;No way that is gonna happen to me right?&#39;</em>

&quot;Saber keep an eye for any possible servant being nearby&quot; Gloria with a serious expression as she made her way to across the streets where she had heard the last murder had ocurred. The empty streets worked on their favor as whoever they found had a high chance to be their target. &quot;Also don&#39;t worry I will try to keep a cool head this time.&quot;

She knew she needed to express that to Saber, in their last fight her temper had almost lead to their possible demise. She had gotten lucky that the one who stopped was so na&#239;ve and seeked an alliance instead of just picking a side. She knew such luck would rarely repeat so regardless she would need to be cautious in her first move.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Saber you smell that?&quot; she said as she turned serious. The house was quite run down, part of the wall on the left side was missing but due to the darkness of the night it was next to impossible to inspect the inside. It was a dangerous move, as they would probably end walking up into a trap. 

Still their options were limited, were they to wait till there was light the police may already be on their way and the longer they just stood there any neightbor or some poor unlucky soul passing may identify them as the murderer drawing even more unwanted attention towards them. 

Flames in the same of 2 small spheres appear next to her as she enter the house through the hole in the wall. It was hard to make sense of the whole situation nor details but she made sure to remain close to Saber were the worse to happen. In what she assumed was the living room they found it, a corpse on a chair with its head removed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber does not exactly have any gripe with Gloria&#39;s temper, but he definitely prefers to check out their enemy first before engaging. Once information is collected based on their reactions, that would be enough to gauge their style when it comes to battle. Without that, they would be taking an extremely risky approach as anything could happen, and it most likely won&#39;t be good.

Walking along the street before coming across a run-down house, Saber halted at the same time as Gloria. It really smells like dead &#39;round here, Saber thought. From the look of things, they&#39;re going to break in, but no one would mind as the house, as if the smell wasn&#39;t enough, isn&#39;t exactly habitable.

 &quot;Do we really have to go in here...&quot;

Saber said as he joined Gloria in entering the house. Taking a good look around, it was not long until Saber&#39;s gaze met the headless corpse just resting on the chair. Another situation involving bloody and messy corpses, at least, from what they&#39;ve seen so far, it&#39;s just one.

 &quot;I wonder what their last thoughts were...&quot;

Based on what&#39;s been happening recently, especially recently as in really recently, some Master-Servant pair with some screws loose is most likely responsible for this. This thing&#39;s getting old, Saber thought. Saber wonders if he&#39;ll ever meet an adversary who at least has some form of sanity in them, maybe someone like that other party he met last time.

 &quot;—but I guess we can&#39;t find out anymore.&quot;

And here&#39;s the punchline. Saber seems to have a tendency to make a wisecrack out of disturbing scenes such as these. It is not the first time he&#39;s done it so it&#39;s probably something to note.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Berenice was as backwater as it came. It was easy to disguise the island&#39;s issues with &#39;rustic charm&#39;, but the place was a shithole, especially if you knew where to look. To Bill, it felt almost nostalgic: The ratio of buildings and landmarks was massive back in America, but a lone Egyptian island? It reminded him of the Old West. Nothing but wastelands for ages with sparse cities connecting them.

Of course, Berenice&#39;s mayor had the same competitive spark of the Americans of old. Industrialization and progress were key, hence why some of the old buildings and ghettos needed to be torn down. Empty space could be turned into places of value. Luxury hotels, water parks, taverns. Anything to improve the island&#39;s economy.

Which is why the Berenice slums were dilapidated, barely filled as its inhabitants had either moved elsewhere or pursued new lives in Aswan. Those who remained were either the poor or the disabled, those who didn&#39;t have the luxury to move. They wouldn&#39;t have the choice once the renovations started, however.

Perhaps they should have happened earlier, then, for the place was a slaughterhouse. Someone had infiltrated the slums at night and fully indulged in a macabre killing spree. Blood was on the walls and houses were filled with corpses. Those who survived were either too shocked to report it, or ignored by the cowardly local police.

And a place outside of the law was the perfect home for Bill.

&quot;Steady, steady-&quot; The cowboy repeated, holding the reins as he approached a bloodied building that was dimly lit by a broken street lamp. The thumping of flesh and cracking of bone could be heard as Leapfrog parked next to the road, Bill on top of it and using it like a makeshift horse. It was surprisingly comfortable, with its top even having enough space and proportions to place a saddle if Bill were so inclined.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103066043896836157 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103066043896836157><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 2, 2023 4:10 PM">4:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Practical value aside, Bill wasn&#39;t exactly too pleased by it.

&quot;Brrrrr.&quot; Archer grumbled, feeling icky at the mere sight of the puppet chimera. It would be fine if it were just a shambling corpse, conjured back to life thanks to black magic. But to think that these were living people forced to move unnaturally with their spines and limbs contorted...

&quot;Gotta say, at least you&#39;re more obedient than a horse.&quot; Bill lightly tapped Leapfrog&#39;s side with his spurs, silencing those thoughts of his. If this was Lachlan&#39;s way of doing things, then he&#39;d simply carry on. Being a puppet was a fate that he wouldn&#39;t wish on his own worst enemy. He enjoyed violence, but not bad mojo that would curse his entire bloodline. That&#39;s what his momma always warned him about.

&quot;Are ya done yet?&quot; Bill shouted at the apartment he had parked it, the door slightly ajar with nothing but darkness within. &quot;Do you need me to come in? Can&#39;t hold that scalpel when you&#39;re half dead, can you?&quot; He laughed, loud enough for Lachlan to hear. Archer had suggested they grabbed corpses from the graveyard, but that would have been pathetic. Grabbing the spoiled leftovers of Marcus Adler would have brought shame to any magus. No, it was more logical to grab them fresh and ripe, courtesy of a rogue Master/Servant having the time of their life at Berenice.

Lachlan grunted as he hoisted a corpse over his shoulder, the weight almost causing him to stumble. Against his better judgment, he shouted back, causing a wave of discomfort to radiate from his freshly healed wound.

It hadn&#39;t been too long since the fight at the graveyard, and to some degree, Lachlan knew he was pushing himself. While Healing Magecraft had sped up his recovery, his body still had its limits. After the pain had receded came a deep sated fatigue. It made him feel as if he were moving on autopilot at times. Going through the motions, performing the necessary tasks required of his role as a Master.

The task description didn&#39;t mention anything about mutilating Leapfrog beyond its original construction, however.

The blueprints for the puppets were not to be followed to the letter, but they carried years of R&amp;D to ensure that the joints and mechanisms functioned without fail. While a Dowling magus could create new designs on the fly or follow their inspiration to make whatever they pleased, a design without proper research was likely to be useless in the long run.

Leapfrog&#39;s model had been designed with mobility and balance in mind, optimized for transportation and travel through even the harshest terrain. But now, at Bill&#39;s behest, and perhaps to the puppeteer&#39;s own amusement, the arachnoid Skinwalker had been transformed yet again. Only that he had operated without a set blueprint in mind.

The puppeteer had opted for something a bit more grounded in reality as he augmented the puppet&#39;s body, contorting it to fit the mold...of a real-life horse.

No cowboy was complete without a horse. And now that Lachlan had fulfilled that ideal image, Bill was finally complete.

...Or something along that line. It was the answer he had given Bill, or would give anyone for that matter, should they dare to question his decision.

But, the truth was, he just wanted to savor Bill&#39;s reaction. 

&#39;I&#39;m almost done,&#39; he added, almost breathless at this point. Carrying a lifeless body was far more strenuous than he had anticipated. Even live prey provided some resistance, some hook for him to grab onto, but the dead weight was just that — a dead weight — and he had to position it with care to prevent blood leaking out of the severed neck to stain his clothes.

<em>Whoever decided to go on a killing spree in this part of town clearly didn&#39;t think this through</em>, he silently judged the mysterious murderer. Not that he was one to speak, especially after the lake incident, but if it were up to him, he would have opted for a cleaner method that was easier to tidy up.

And so, with his mind preoccupied with the thoughts of efficient killing methods and the body parts he would get to salvage from the corpse, he shouldered open the door from the basement to the main room...

And froze upon the presence of two intruders.

She had learn her lesson although honestly she rather not have dealt with such situation to begin with. Still her hand moved towards her gun as her cape hide her motion as even if she was not aiming to attack first it was never bad to be prepared. 

Still a bad feeling was ever present in her mind. The normalcy in his tone and his lack of reaction to the fire spheres around her. That person was not a regular human, that much could be inferred but besides that there was nothing that she could be sure of. 

&quot;Oh this is your house?&quot; she said feigning ignorance. While she wanted to call him a liar there was no real proof this wasn&#39;t actually his house. For all she knew he legally owned this property and was just a shitty owner. 

&quot;I am sorry for the intrusion&quot; she spoke as she gave the young man a small bow. 

<em>&#39;Saber, keep an eye for any enemies around us&#39;</em>

She was trying to remain peaceful, but that didn&#39;t mean she was just gonna leave herself open. With multiple possibilities in front of her she couldn&#39;t just rush into action as even with the dead body it didn&#39;t meant that the boy had commit the murder. In that case she couldn&#39;t just waste time as there was a chance the killer was still somewhat near. 

&quot;We will leave soon but if you don&#39;t mind telling me&quot; she turned around giving Lachlan a perfect chance to stab her in the back were he wished to. &quot;You know anything about what happened to this person?&quot;

It was worth asking,  int he worst case he didn&#39;t anything and therefor she and Saber could deal with him later an in case he did it was still an useful piece of information.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Looking around, his gaze went to an approximate origin of the sound, then to Gloria just to check on her well being, then to everywhere else to take in the surroundings around them.

He does not need to be told to keep an eye out for what could possibly be their next adversary. Knowing the pattern, this will definitely lead to a physical confrontation unless they happen to be the diplomatic type. It was not long until he saw movement and then what seems to be a person, one that is definitely alive and thinking.

 &quot;You heard the lady, you can choose to remain silent or entertain our question. Either way, we&#39;re leaving.&quot;

Saber voiced out his thoughts while taking his time to slowly break into a stance. Despite the offer of not wishing to confront the other in a fight, Saber felt that it is only right for him to be on guard. The enemy could strike at any moment, and it does not help that Gloria is letting her own guard down.

Breaking into a stance. Plant the left foot forward, shuffle the right foot backwards, pull the blade out and place over the head. Both hands gripping the sword, the right near the guard, the left near the pommel. Servant Saber, ready to engage.

 &quot;If you&#39;d like us to say, then go ahead and give us a warm welcome.&quot;

Several thoughts raced in Saber&#39;s head: Is there anyone else? Is this kid here a Master? If so, where&#39;s their Servant and what is their class? Regardless of his concerns, once everything hits the fan, all he has to do is cut that thing down and nothing else. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Looks like their graverobbing had been noticed.

<em>&lt;You think I&#39;m a fucking Caster?! And here I thought mages were supposed to be useful.&gt;</em> Archer spat out, kicking Leapfrog to the side and forcing the puppet to move. If there was one thing Bill couldn&#39;t complain about, it was Leapfrog&#39;s speed. And versatility. The horses of old were not only slower, but temperamental as well. They would refuse to walk uphill, or go around rocks instead of braving them.

Leapfrog had no such concerns. One would normally circle around the building&#39;s side if their plan was to approach covertly, but not Bill. Instead, he ordered Leapfrog to climb the apartment walls with its able limbs, nails digging onto the surface as it put professional rock climbers to shame. All Bill had to do was adjust his position, namely getting off his seat and instead hugging at the mass of bodies as it reached the apartment roof.

&quot;Good boy.&quot; Bill patted the vile creature, then ordered it to stay put. &quot;Your hear gunshots, you come running. Got it?&quot; He asked, receiving only a grumble as a reply. The silent type. Oh well, if Lachlan was in real danger, he was sure his puppets would join in on the rescue.

With that done, Bill started to descend on his own. He crawled through an open window and entered the apartment living room, slowly making his way back to Lachlan as he overheard the ongoing conversation. He took a peek, hiding himself as he saw the people in question: A woman and a boy in an odd garb, usually the telltale sign of a Servant. His theory was confirmed by their attitude, brandishing a sword and putting themselves between Gloria. He&#39;d be shocked if that weren&#39;t a Servant.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103409787036770314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103409787036770314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 2:56 PM">2:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
They seemed to be alert. A bit too alert for Bill&#39;s tastes. That&#39;s why he didn&#39;t even bother hiding himself, instead entering the scene with a judgmental look on his eyes directed straight towards Lachlan.

&quot;Well well, what&#39;s all this then?&quot; Bill asked, stroking his chin. &quot;Y&#39;all checking out the corpses here as well? Nasty stuff, I tell ya.&quot; He said with a smile, appearing friendly. Deep down, he was judging the length of Saber&#39;s blade and if they were fast enough to slice through one of his bullets. Meanwhile, Gloria and Saber would no doubt expect that Archer was a Servant. Their appearance and general presence gave it away.

&quot;Now, that guy looks dead for sure.&quot; He burst in laughter, pointing at the corpse that Lachlan was carrying. Saber couldn&#39;t tell if Bill intended to fight just yet, but his casual demeanor was unnerving to say the least.

<em>&lt;I got a clear shot to the woman&#39;s head.&gt;</em> Bill whispered in Lachlan&#39;s mind. <em>&lt;I can take it. Unless you got other plans, that is.&gt;</em> He kept staring with that dumb smile, awaiting an answer. The cowboy looked docile, but his fingers were twitching with anticipation. The chance of an easy kill was not one to be taken lightly in the West. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan was willing to bet on the latter. It was hard not to, when the two of them had clearly put up their defenses: defenses that would have been overkill if Lachlan were an ordinary civilian. 

So, they knew. That made things easier.

&#39;Are you requesting an autopsy? I don&#39;t have the facilities for a proper examination, but I can certainly offer you my best guess.&#39; 

He replied to Gloria&#39;s inquiry with a touch of dramatic flair, unloading the corpse onto the chair in the middle of the room as he did so. Now there were two headless bodies stacked on top of each other.

&#39;From what I can tell, the cause of death was severe blood loss from a severed head.&#39; The puppeteer continued to explain. &#39;Most likely done in by some sort of beast, or perhaps a <em>phantasmal</em>, if we want to stick to more familiar grounds.&#39;

His response was nothing but trivial banter. It was obvious that anyone with even the most basic observational skills could have arrived at the same conclusion by examining the corpses themselves. However, in using knowledge that only mages possessed, he had inadvertently confirmed the Saber pair&#39;s suspicion about his identity.

A magus. Or, a fellow Master. Where was his Servant?

The noise on the wall outside signaled them to the Archer&#39;s presence. Bill wasn&#39;t exactly hiding. There simply wasn&#39;t any point anymore. 

As the outlaw entered the house in typical burglar fashion, Lachlan seized the opportunity to wipe his hands on the rags hanging off the corpses. 

&#39;Really though, I have no idea. Didn&#39;t arrive early enough to catch a glimpse of the murderer.&#39; He admitted with a shrug. &#39;But hey, who cares? There&#39;s nothing for you here anyway. And even if you insist on staying, I&#39;m afraid my tea-brewing skills aren&#39;t quite up to par. And as such, I must ask you to leave.&#39;

She turned her head for a bit to see the new arrival before Lachlan began speaking just to turn her back towards them again. Still on first impression alone it was hard for Gloria to decide on her next move. The young man and his servant provided her no information she hadn&#39;t already got by herself at this point. 

Still their attitude did in fact gave her a hint, it was obvious they didn&#39;t care about the murders or if they did they could hide their disdain so well to even fool her. So a question popped into her head

Why were those 2 here???

<em>&#39;Saber if the servant tries to attack me you think you can protect me?&#39;</em> the question run through their mental link as she remain still looking at the corpse. It was hard to tell how this would go but it was better to have a plan. Saber answer would determine whenever they were to run or fight.

<em>&#39;They are lying, not sure about what but just in case be prepared.&#39;</em>

Despite the question she trusted Saber, but trust doesn&#39;t change facts and they knew so little of the other pair to rush into action. 

Still the previous question remained in her mind, Was this meeting just a simple coincidence? Bad luck? It was possible. Still they called this place their home, was that also a lie or it was truly their base?  That would explain why they wanted their gone but it didn&#39;t fit with their lack of knowledge about what happened. 

<em>&#39;Saber I&#39;m gonna take a gamble, sorry in advance&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103867136566362252 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103867136566362252><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 4, 2023 9:13 PM">9:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Oh I see&quot; she said with a sigh. For a moment it seemed like she had accepted their words and was ready to leave. &quot;Sorry for bothering you then, I guess we will be on our way&quot;

This was a gamble it could lead to nothing happening or worse something happening but them not gaining anything from it. 

&quot;Still it must be very embarrassing, having so many people coming into one house, doing whatever one wants and one being completely ignorant of it&quot; she said as she let out a small smirk as she turned her head towards Lachlan with a smile as if she was trying to to hide her laughter.  

&quot;Like how dumb must one be? Specially with such a big dude there to watch your back well guess some pleople just suck at remaining vigilant.&quot; she turned her face away from Lachlan &quot;Well be careful kid, and maybe you should clean this, others may not be as understanding as me and think you are responsible. You being quite helpful so I wouldn&#39;t want you in trouble for someone else messing with your house.&quot; she didnt even dare to look at Lachlan as she lifted her arm and waved as she began to walk away from the two. 

&#39;Saber if they move give me a shout&#39; she ordered as she knew there were few ways this could play. 

She had met many magus before and if there was something most of them had in common was the arrogance. With any luck the kid may spill some more info after being talked that way but he may also just freak out and try to murder them for the disrespected.

Saber gave a light exhale, expressing his contempt for the other pair&#39;s lack of secrecy. While it is not the first time it has happened, it is getting quite old now.

Checking them out, looks like all Saber wishes to know is satisfied. It looks like the Servant is a sharpshooter, huh, like the ones from the movies. It makes Saber wonder what the Servant has to gain from exposing themselves like this.

Saber is not exactly foreign to fighting against opponents that excel at range, it just means more effort is required to come out on top. However, it does not really matter, especially at <em>the distance between him and them</em>. If Saber were to take a few steps forward, the pair would enter his effective range and, knowing Saber, it would be rather difficult to leave.

As Saber was deep in thought, it took him a while until he realized Gloria was making her way out of the area. Tch, they were positioned perfectly, Saber thought. Expressing his slight annoyance with a sigh, Saber too began to make his way out, of course with caution.

 &quot;Very well, we&#39;ll just go on our merry way then.&quot;

Saber went along with Gloria, still facing the pair with his sword held on one hand, moved to a lower level pointing at them. While leaving, Saber can&#39;t help but feel as if they would initiate their pursuit of them as soon as his eyes are away from them. Perhaps a little distraction is warranted?

 &quot;Before we go though, how about a little parting gift?&quot;

Hastily reaching into his garments, he pulled out what looks to be a firearm. It was not long before he began emptying the magazine into the general direction of the pair, a sprinkle of lead 45 inches in diameter on the way to their beloved recipient. While he could have taken the time to aim, the attempt would lose its effectiveness upon doing so... and Saber isn&#39;t exactly a great shot with any gun. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He felt that plenty from Gloria and Saber&#39;s actions alone, causing him to tilt his hat a bit and hide his gaze. 

<em>&lt;Oh, bother.&gt;</em> He remarked to himself, the stray thought crossing over to Lachlan&#39;s mind. Instead of sharing his plight, his Master joined in on the judgmental glares. 

<em>&lt;Shut up, brat, or I might shoot you too by accident.&gt;</em> He spat back, rolling his eyes. Lachlan did have a point, perhaps Bill was acting soft, or maybe his attempt to be &#39;nice&#39; and respect his Master&#39;s autonomy had backfired. Some people simply didn&#39;t deserve to be spoiled.

<em>&lt;Next time I&#39;ll just do things my way, alright? Don&#39;t go complaining then-&gt;</em>

They were about to get into another petty squabble before Bill noticed the subtle, fidgety movement in Saber&#39;s hand. The sign of someone reaching for a gun, but lacking the experience to mask their intent.

<em>&lt;Get down, boy!&gt;</em> Bill shouted, immediately throwing himself at Lachlan and kicking his Master away, sending him flying into a corner of the room. This meant that the cowboy received the brunt of the blow, bullets grazing his skin and ruining his coat&#39;s exquisite appearance. 

But one thing he couldn&#39;t stand was Saber&#39;s amateur marksmanship. He was no Archer. He didn&#39;t even know what class he was, but it was laughable.

&quot;You call that a gift? Don&#39;t be so stingy, you lil&#39; shit.&quot; Cherokee Bill howled, taking out both of his pistols and crossing his arms into an X, the two barrels pointed at different targets. 

<em>BANG! BANG!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104507337709981809 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104507337709981809><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 6, 2023 3:37 PM">3:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The bullets crossed, heading towards their separate targets. Gloria wouldn&#39;t realize that a bullet was homing straight for her back, but Saber could see it clearly, the projectile faster than the naked eye and being visible only in the realm of Servants. This confirmed their suspicions, that the gunslinger in front of them was no doubt Lachlan&#39;s Servant.

Of course, it was hard for Saber to react when the other bullet was headed straight for his face. He didn&#39;t have the luxury of protecting Gloria, since that would mean him taking the hit. Somehow, Saber had to find a way to both protect himself and his Master. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A staccato of bullets as Saber withdrew a gun and started spraying in his general direction. Lachlan had not anticipated such maneuver: he was preoccupied with Gloria and his own Servant&#39;s belligerent attitude.

Before he could even process what was happening, a shadow passed in front of him, knocking him out of the way. Lachlan staggered sideways. He grabbed the back of the chair out of pure reflex, the weight of the two corpses providing an anchor of sorts as he came down on his knees, painfully hard. 

<em>&lt;Bill, what the fuck!&gt;</em>

A little thanks wouldn&#39;t have hurt, but his kneecaps were too busy absorbing the shock from the crash landing, while his tongue was too busy biting down on curses to formulate any nice words for the Archer. But who needed gratitude when you shared a bond with an outlaw? A &#39;fuck you&#39; was practically a &#39;thanks, brother&#39; in the world of rough-talking, trigger-happy outlaws. 

And so he jammed the outburst into Bill&#39;s cranium, wincing as his eyes finally caught up with what had transpired. The gunslinger had drawn his own weapons and fired, while the enemy Servant, despite wielding a sword, had foolishly attempted to beat an Archer at his own game.

Not the brightest moment he had witnessed in Berenice so far. But annoying nonetheless. Since when did guns become standard equipment among Servants?

&#39;You know what, you are right,&#39; he snapped at Gloria. &#39;How foolish of me to allow unwanted visitors just waltzing in like they own the place. Thanks for enlighteningly silly old me,&#39; he said with an eye roll, fingers digging into the chair as he pulled himself up.

&#39;Unfortunately, my schedule&#39;s packed with other important matters, such as contemplating my regret for ever inviting you to <em>speak</em>. But let me and my Servant fix that right now,&#39; he said, then tugged at the mental strings that connected him to his puppets.

It proved to be nothing but a negligible happening to the Servant, only managing to dirty his attire. However, it, to Saber&#39;s surprise, managed to cause a little mess for the pair. They probably didn&#39;t expect this to happen, Saber thought.

With the bullets loaded spent, Saber pulled his firearm back to return to a melee guard. As they say, switching to your secondary is faster than reloading... well, it&#39;s more like primary here. Though they had planned to leave right away, Saber kept in mind the fact that the Servant is not bothered by his attack.

His vigilance for the worst was not for nothing however as it was not long till the Servant, or rather, Archer made a rather threatening statement followed by the threat itself. His senses heightened, a moment of information presented itself through the ripping of the air. Two bullets, one is headed somewhere past his peripherals, which may as well be Gloria, and the other appears to be making its way between his eyes. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1105436083329703966 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1105436083329703966><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 9, 2023 5:08 AM">5:08 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Whoosh.

Evading one with his rotation and facing the other with his blade, with the angular momentum and a little flick of the wrist, the bullet was sent off.

 &quot;Nice one, pardner.&quot;

Saber spoke in a stereotypical accent, referencing the Western movie star looking Servant&#39;s appearance. While they may not be in any serious harm, they may as well be bleeding.  Saber&#39;s chance to close in is dispelled by the distance between him and Archer combined with the fact that Archer is already set up to do what he does <em>best</em>. There is <em>nothing</em> stopping him from resuming pressure with a hail of bullets.

?!

What in the world is that... Saber called for his Master&#39;s attention as the ceiling started collapsing. There is something coming through as well, that something also looks really ugly too. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Except that Saber decided to do its own thing, honestly she couldn&#39;t blame him she would had been wanting to do the same thing for a while but she had decided against it due to not wanting to avoid being reckless. But if it was Saber the one starting things up then it wasn&#39;t her fault right?

Only shame was that he moved to fast he wanted to give the pair to get a bit angry and see if they would spill the beans about this place and something they may know about the killer but there was no point in complaining about that right now. As soon as she hear the sound of the gun being fire she turned to where last remember Lachlan being. She was used to conflict and her experience alongside of what to expect make her react slightly better than Lachlan. There was also the fact that unlike the young man she wasn&#39;t kicked out of the way, 

Either way Bill and Lachlan were now separated and that was exactly what Gloria needed. She had total trust on Saber and his judgement at least when it came to battles. In her eyes the fact that Saber had taken the first action meant that he could deal with the enemy. She had no idea if that meant winning or just stalling but it matter little. If he could beat him then there was no problem and if he couldn&#39;t then she just needed to kill the master as quickly as possible. 

She began to run towards Lachlan not caring in the slightless that Bill was aiming at her. She couldn&#39;t do anything even if she did afterall. She had seen Saber in action enough times to know that even if she tried to run or dodge those bullets would kill her. So all she could was trust Saber.

As she run towards him Lachlan did mouth off, honestly in Gloria&#39;s eyes he was no different from a child. Scratch that even her small kid behaved better than that.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;You didn&#39;t invite us, you were just too careless to realize we were here in the first place.&quot; she pulled her guns and aimed at him but before she could even pull the trigger Saber warning came out. 

As soon as she heard the sound of Saber warning she heard the ceiling cracking. Something was coming down and her many options were suddenly reduced. 

She couldn&#39;t stop,  if she stopped moving not only whatever was falling but the debris could just smash her into pulp. So she moved forward, flames wrapped around her legs aiming to push her as close as she could to Lachlan. It was a gamble, but she assumed that the guy wouldn&#39;t be as dumb to try and kill himself due to the debris and so she rush forward trying to tackle the young man.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not like he needed to, since Lachlan was only unharmed thanks to the Archer&#39;s quick intervention. Soon, Lachlan went silent, allowing the cowboy to focus back on the Servant, who just like he had predicted-

&quot;Tch, a Saber.&quot; Bill grunted, noticing his opponent&#39;s blade effortlessly cleave through his bullets. No ordinary sword could have done that, meaning that it was most likely Saber&#39;s skill at display. That, or the weapon itself was a Noble Phantasm. Possibly both.

&quot;We don&#39;t talk like that.&quot; Archer spat back at the Servant&#39;s poor Western impersonation. He repositioned, kicking up a table towards Saber&#39;s location to mask his approach as he circled around it and pointed his guns sideways.

<em>CRASH!</em>

That&#39;s when the ceiling gave away, a huge lump of flesh descending from below like a pile of molasses. Bill knew perfectly what it was, especially once he caught the grin on Lachlan&#39;s face. He couldn&#39;t help but smile back.

&quot;Word of advice, <em>pardner.</em> Mind your own back first.&quot; Bill replied, watching Saber warn Gloria and leave himself open.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

In the span of three seconds, Bill had circled around his opponent fully, letting six bullets spiral towards their target like a blooming flower. One for the hand holding the blade, another for the head, the other for the foot and so on. Targeted spots that had been handpicked to cripple Saber&#39;s capabilities.

And of course, instead of pushing his assault, Bill simply backed off, staying a safe distance of over ten meters away. An Archer like him could be as scummy as they pleased.

<em>&lt;Ya think you can kill that Master for me? Pretty please?&gt;</em> He poked his words back into Lachlan&#39;s head. <em>&lt;Unless that suck up of yours is recording this too.&gt;</em>

Don&#39;t forget to pick him up from the news station later. If that Saber hasn&#39;t turned you into a pincushion, that is.&gt;</em> Lachlan said snidely. He hauled one of the corpses from the chair as Gloria rushed towards him, shoving its limp body into the woman.

An unappetizing <em>squelch</em> followed. The corpse burst open like a revolting, swollen zit, showering the woman&#39;s cloak in aged blood.

The sight was intriguing, to say the least. The fact that the blood hadn&#39;t yet coagulated indicated a relatively fresh kill. Lachlan filed away that piece of information. If they were fortunate, the perpetrator might still be nearby, leaving behind a potential trail. All they had to do was eliminate the obstacle in front of them, and they would be free to meet this alleged serial killer themselves. A potential deal could be struck then.

All they had to do was get rid of the Master and Servant before them.

&#39;That&#39;d be implying that you are an actual <em>threat</em> that deserves my attention.&#39; He made a &#39;good-natured&#39; suggestion to Gloria as he used the corpse as a makeshift shield, and attempted to throw them both to the side. &#39;Well, are you?&#39;

<em>THUNK</em>

Before the dust and debris could settle, a grotesque figure descended from the ceiling and landed firmly on the floor. Its body had been horrifically deformed, with multiple human limbs fused together to serve as legs and a neck-like extension supporting a protruding head, resembling that of a equine.

The creature emitted a screech that was reminiscent of a heavy smoker&#39;s wheeze, before darting around the room with the agility of a galloping horse. It was headed straight for Gloria as it attempted to deliver a headbutt from the side!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 12:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107355189930897500 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107355189930897500><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 12:14 PM">12:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With each new encounter that belief was reinforced as despite being quite familiar with it it it also made her sick to her core. The blood painted her white coat as the two bodies collied stopping her in her tracks at least for a moment. 

The flames on Gloria&#39;s legs boosted her speed for a few moments but at the same times the sudden acceleration make it so once she had chosen a direction she couldn&#39;t change it, that also meant small movements like dodging as she dashes were not possible unless she wanted to risk changing her course completely and crashing somewhere else. 

Still while normally due to her small frame a body being throw at her would not only stop her but even threaten to push her into the floor the acceleration actually let her remain on her feet. After all her main goal had been reached which was to close the distance between her and Lachlan. 

And so she stood firm, holding for a moment the corpse. Even now she couldn&#39;t get rid of her own hipocrecy. She couldn&#39;t afford to worry about this bystanders, she needed to harden heart and do whatever&#39;s had to in order to survive and reach her miracle yet....

But she didn&#39;t had time to let her mind nor emotions wander as the crashing stopped and she witness being which she didn&#39;t knew how to define. Even the word monster was something so generous. 

&quot;An ugly beast for an ugly child.&quot; Her  words were short as once again more and more decision presented themselves in front of her. 

She pointed one of her guns at the beast running at her and just began shooting at is head with regular ammo. She didn&#39;t expected those low caliber bullets to have an effect, they were a means for her to gauge the distance and timing of her next attack. Still she couldn&#39;t just focus on the monster.  Was the monster Lachlan&#39;s? Or his servant ability? She had no way of knowing but for sure at least not now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had blood on her face and clothes. She was definitely gonna need a shower later. 

She stared right at the coming beast and flames began to gather around her. From the corpse, a crimson beam sprouted, without looking Gloria had shot one of her charged shots through the body, leaving a charring black hole in it. She gritted her teeth as she pulled the trigger, she knew that the poor victim had suffered enough and if possible she didn&#39;t wanted to desecrate its body even more but right now she had to use whatever means she had. 

The beam was aimed at Lachlan, still while the attack may come from an unexpected spot, The corpse did affect the power and accuracy of the shoot. Even if Lachlan were to get hit it wouldn&#39;t be fatal as it would only hit him on the shoulder but it would most definitely hurt

Yet that left the issue of the other problem, how to deal with such massive beast. Honestly she didn&#39;t knew but she had to try her best.

&quot;Ignia!!&quot; she yelled as a crimson arm appeared next to her as it push forward meeting what appeared to be the monster head in a direct clash of power.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Following wherever Archer was headed, he turned around to a sound and sight similar to one just minutes ago.  Bullets, this time headed towards him in a rather artistic manner... damn, they&#39;re awfully close too.

Since they&#39;re spread apart, they&#39;re rather difficult to intercept and parry, even more so since they are bullets. As pretty and smart as they are however, Saber did not need to think that much, his turning motion naturally allows him to evade a shot and another. Just raise the sword and block the ones headed towards the vitals...

Clank. Clank. Clank. Whoosh. Rip. Thump.

A bullet managed to rip through Saber&#39;s <em>hakama</em>, trousers, cutting his skin and shedding a little blood. The cut is negligible though he did stumble backwards a bit. Staggering on his feet, he went ahead to pick himself back up.

 &quot;That&#39;s a really good one, I like that.&quot;

Saber complimented Archer&#39;s thinking, how could he have missed that, he thought to himself. That one up the other in their little battle of wits is only for this one instance however. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108273511052607498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108273511052607498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 1:03 AM">1:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Moving his head to take a small glance over his shoulder to check on Gloria, making sure to not turn all the way, before looking back at Archer.

With the show the two put up, it seems like Saber needs to step up his speed in thought and muscle. Saber started to loosen up his body through a short little on-the-spot warmup, conditioning his body for what could be a really long fight.

 &quot;I catch on things pretty fast though, I&#39;d suggest you change it up this time.&quot;

Saber, with his mind, body, and spirit in tune, is prepared to resume the fight with Archer, breaking into a similar stance as earlier. Though Gloria may be in a pickle, Saber can&#39;t intervene without putting both of them in trouble, he&#39;s going to have to deal with Archer first unless an opportunity to strike their Master arises. Saber will have to trust Gloria to handle herself while he does his thing at the same time.

It&#39;s go time. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If his Master was in a good enough mood to joke, then they were probably fine. He would leave them to their own devices, since that was part of their agreement. Respect each others&#39; boundaries and all that self-help stuff that people would peddle to you in this day and age.

Plus, Archer already had his hands full with the other Servant. Despite the varied angles, the instinctual calculations and the quality of his bullets, Saber had swatted them away with ease without breaking a sweat.

...Save for a slight cut on the skin. Droplets of blood poured, but it was a mere scratch to a Servant. There was no shock, nor rage. Saber simply recomposed himself, took a stance again and adapted. Just like Bill, he left his Master behind, because he was confident that they could take care of themselves.

This was what it meant to be a participant in the Holy Grail War.

&quot;Hah.&quot; Bill laughed, even though he was getting slightly ticked at how lowly the gun had fallen. First the mutt from the graveyard and now this Saber. Why was he bothering to use guns in the first place compared to sticks and swords?

But there was one thing a gun had over a sword. It was something that had been discovered since the dawn of time, when mankind found a weapon far more effective than an axe, a spear, a sword or a hammer.

<strong>The bow.</strong>

The very representation of the Archer Class. The ability to harm from a distance without sacrificing one&#39;s safety. It might lack in power, it might lack in speed, but an archer would rarely come to harm if they played their cards perfectly.

Which is exactly what Bill intended to do.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108528299610750986 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108528299610750986><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 5:55 PM">5:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Do I <strong>need to change things up?&quot;</strong> Bill asked, louder this time around. Blood was pumping in his veins as the thought of putting Saber down filled him with excitement. He whipped out both of his guns and took aim, right towards Saber&#39;s existing injuries.

&quot;Ten, eleven, twelve,&quot; Bill started taking steps back and counting them while still keeping his guns steady. They were rigid like stone, preventing any form of imbalance or shambling from affecting their trajectory. <strong>&quot;twenty meters.</strong> Is your sword that long? That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know. Can you still advance with a rain of bullets on you? That&#39;s <em>also</em> something I&#39;d like to know. Heheheh.&quot;

He placed his finger on the trigger.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Six shots from each gun for a combined total of twelve bullets directed straight towards Saber&#39;s injury. The torn <em>hakama</em> was an excellent reference point, giving Bill the perfect target to aim for. Instead of the elegant floral pattern from earlier, these bullets were straight to the point, aimed in a straight line with minimal sway. If anything, Archer had weaponized the sway, spacing his bullets just enough so that if Saber blocked one projectile, the other was designed to fly right past their katana during the downtime that it took to perform a second slash. This wasn&#39;t calculated: It was pure instinct, something that Cherokee Bill had learned throughout years of gun warfare. Those guns of his were no longer weapons, but key organs.

It seemed as if Saber had finally found an interesting opponent. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He did not particularly enjoy the way Gloria spoke. 

With the corpse sandwiched between them, he took a moment to assess the Master in front of him. Flames danced around her, while her ensemble gave off the impression of someone was either a seasoned traveler, or watched one too many hero flicks. It was clear that she was accustomed to physical confrontations, which was a far cry from the elderly necromancer of the Adler family. 

Bill&#39;s warning echoed in his mind, but just like the Archer, he was quick to dismiss it with a scoff. It was easy to handle someone like Gloria, even if he wasn&#39;t particularly skilled in hand-to-hand combat himself...

After all, puppeteers were never meant to stay on the front lines themselves, were they?

&#39;You&#39;ve overstayed your welcome, woman!&#39; 

He stepped back then, just as his eyes caught movement under Gloria&#39;s cloak. But before he could scrutinize her actions further, the floor beneath them emitted a terrible creak, its aging structure further strained by the presence of Leapfrog hurtling towards her like an enraged beast.

Followed by a resounding <em>BANG!</em> from the woman, camouflaged by the deluge of bullets Archer had unloaded into Saber. Heat seared Lachlan&#39;s shoulder as a glowing arm appeared behind Gloria, pounding Leapfrog into the floor—

<em><strong>CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK CRACK</strong></em>

A series of thunderous cracks reverberated throughout the room as the poorly maintained floorboards, no longer able to withstand the abuse caused by its unruly inhabitants, finally gave away. For a fleeting moment, weightlessness overtook them all...

Then they plunged into the darkness below.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108850860051665016 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108850860051665016><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 3:17 PM">3:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While the fire fist succeeded in stopping the beast,  her constructions weren&#39;t indestructible or anything of the sort. Flames are shapeless, but by giving them shapes you also give them weakness they lacked in their natural form. 

So even when her constructions were made of her flames, they could be cut down or broken by attacks which were more powerful than hers. Cracks appeared on the fist, it wasn&#39;t that much of a problem as as long as she didn&#39;t exceed the amount she was capable of creating. Still the situation was far from ideal, she had managed to deal some damage to both or at least that is what she though. Like as sturdy as that ball of flesh was she didn&#39;t think it was completely unscathed. 

This was gonna be tough, the kid was either smart of afraid as from that little exchange she could tell that he was trying to keep its distance from her. But before she could even start her next move the floor caved. 

She didnt had time to yell, as she fell into the darkness  as he construction disappeared. For a moment all turn black. She rolled and rolled without any sense of direction till she finally hit something rock solid. Her body hurt due to the fall but it wasn&#39;t so bad. She would need a moment obviously but at least she could still move without issues. 

She looked around, the rubble and dust make what was already a really dark place even darker. She look around but couldn&#39;t really tell where she was. Her first instinct was to create another small fireball to serve as light but she kept herself from doing that. She didn&#39;t knew if the enemy had the same issues at her and even if they did the sphere would give away her location. 

&lt;Saber? Did you also fell down? If so any idea where we are??&gt; she asked the swordsman through their mental link aiming to gain any bit of information possible.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Does he really think he can beat an Archer at their own game? No, Saber knows he is a Saber. A Saber can never play the Archer game better than the Archer themselves. But, was he really playing the same game to begin with?

If Saber actually tried to play the Archer game, he would lose every single time. He could have taken his time aiming but Archer would just put him down without even giving him a chance to try. Saber can&#39;t even be summoned as an Archer, as, in legend, he never showed any significant feats in the way of the bowman. He is a Saber through and through, so why is he doing this?

It&#39;s going to be like in the movies, Saber thought early into his summoning, upon being exposed to firearms in person. It is a foolish thought however he did not mean it literally. In those flashy martial arts movies, the gun was used as if it was an extension of the limbs instead of a ranged weapon.

That&#39;s right, for Saber, the gun serves as an extension of the limbs... <em>just like in the movies</em>. It will never hurt a Servant directly, but it will be like sand in the eyes except it reaches really far this time.

 &quot;My sword is as long as it needs to be, nothing more and nothing less.&quot;

Saber said with great confidence and strong conviction. A swordsman must always put all their trust in their skill with the sword. The moment they have doubt in themselves, they will hesitate... that very moment could mean the difference between life and death. As always, all Saber needs to do is just to cut the enemy down.

The muscles never lie, a thought that Saber learned and followed in life. A good look at their extensions and contractions is all that is needed. Once a reading is made, a sharp response will be a given. Saber will do exactly just that as he has done several times before, though it will be a little difficult for the fingers and the window for a response is tight since it is a gun. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109228814514536498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109228814514536498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 4:19 PM">4:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>?

That was a really telegraphed attack. Does this guy have something against the floor? Saber stepped to the side as soon as the bullets were fired, to his surprise, that was all there is. The trail of bullets were headed straight for legs, understandable action but he does know it is still fully functional, right? Were they trying to hit something else?

 &quot;You certainly changed things up, but I did not mean it like that—&quot;

!!!

 &quot;What in the—?!&quot;

It was not long until the floor beneath his feet collapsed and sent him falling down into a place where darkness was its&#39; only resident until they all fell. Saber spun as he fell, unable to tell how far he is from solid ground because of disorientation.

Thump.

After a rough landing, Saber is on something solid now. Looking around, it sure is dark around here... can&#39;t even see the hole where he came from due to how dark the house interiors was to begin with. Picking himself back up, he felt himself for any wounds and injuries. Aside from the cut from earlier, he does not seem to be in any serious harm.

 &lt;Yeah, I fell too. I have no idea where we are but it smells like rotten egg here.&gt;

Saber took his time to adjust to the darkness. In the mean time, he felt for his gun around where he fell as well for another magazine. It was not far, so it did not take much for him to find it. Saber loaded in the new magazine and prepared himself for what comes next. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Good, just what he would expect from the so-called strongest Knight Class Servant. &quot;I like your style.&quot; He gave a brief compliment, licking his lips in anticipation as he watched the swordsman attempt to expertly dodge his volley of bullets and close the distance.

The great thing about being an Archer was that you didn&#39;t need to be the fastest draw in the West. The further away you were from the target, the less reaction times mattered. It gave Bill a head start on any decision to make, a chance to calculate where his target would be next and an opportunity for his bullet to match their speed.

&quot;You call this changing things up? You haven&#39;t seen nothing-&quot; He boasted, about to blow Saber&#39;s mind with the next trick up his sleeve. Except he never got the chance to show it, since the two of them were so distracted by the duel that they neglected to notice the floor crumbling beneath their feet. Leapfrog&#39;s thrashing had exposed the house&#39;s shoddy construction work, the marble tiles giving way as the world turned dark.

<em>drip drip SPLASH</em>

Bill landed on something wet and filthy, just the way he liked it. A rat crawled out of his boot, half mangled by falling debris and Bill&#39;s own spuds. He kicked the corpse away and groaned, being able to only barely make out the environment around him. Judging by the tunnels, the tubes and the incessant dripping of filth-

<em>&quot;A sewer?&quot;</em> He thought, leaning his back on a wall as he slid across it like a roach. He couldn&#39;t see where Saber had gone, but he presumed they were nearby due to them falling down at around the same time. He knew he couldn&#39;t afford to waste time on the swordsman, however.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109256729314730054 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109256729314730054><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 6:10 PM">6:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Don&#39;t tell me they got you already!&gt;</em> He tried looking for any signs of his Master, but could only see shadowy shapes in the distance. One thing he did notice, however, was the subtle trembling of the floor. It wasn&#39;t nerves and was far too repetitive to be an earthquake. It felt easy to pinpoint what exactly &#39;it&#39; was.

A burning sensation pulsated in his left shoulder. He instinctively touched it, and his hand came back wet with blood. Against better judgment, he rolled his shoulders, wincing as the stinging pain as his muscles pulled tout. 

At least he could still move his shoulder. Lachlan was pleased to find that the wound wasn&#39;t as deep as he&#39;d initially thought. All things considered, it was relatively minor, though he would need better lightning to properly address it.

Unfortunately, light was a luxury in the dark underbelly of the house. The sewer tunnels were cool, damp, and filled with the stench of filth and decay. It was a place that suited him just fine. Just another day at the lab...

<em>&lt;She had a familiar, some kind of flame elemental.&gt;</em> He relayed the message back to Bill through their telepathic link. <em>&lt;Leapfrog isn&#39;t strong enough to handle it. I&#39;ll send it your way soon.&gt;</em>

He made the decision without a second thought. Of course, there was no point in keeping something around if it was too weak and destined to fail. Better to have it serve a better purpose than mere cannon fodder. 

Though he would get his money&#39;s worth out of the creature yet. Despite the darkness of his visuals, he still maintained the mental connection with the puppet. With a little coaxing, Leapfrog relayed its relative position back to its master, before it began to thrash around once more. It used its deformed limbs like the whiskers of a cat, exploring its surroundings until it snagged the fringe of Gloria&#39;s cloak. 

The puppet&#39;s erratic movements most likely caused some confusion for the woman. Had she not just displayed her superiority over it? Was it asking to be pummeled again? But even so—

But, if you&#39;re eager to become a part of my collection, I won&#39;t stop you.&#39;

He barked back at the Archer next. <em>&lt;Pyg is <strong>not</strong> fat,&gt;</em> he almost rolled his eyes. <em>&lt;He&#39;s simply well-built. I parked him a few houses down, but he should get here soon...&gt;</em>

He paused, contemplating whether it was worthwhile to reveal anything else with the Archer. Bill sounded rather concerned with his condition, and considering what they had been through recently, they probably warranted some openness in this partnership of theirs.

<em>&lt;Got nicked on the shoulder,&gt;</em> he admitted uneasily, fully anticipating some manner of mockery from his Servant. First knives, and now bullets? For someone who supposedly operated from the shadows, he seemed to attract injuries quite often.

&lt;Yeah I can smell it as well. Maybe we are into a sewer?&gt; she answer Saber as tried to make heads and tails of the current situation.

 Her eyes had slowly began to get used to the darkness but even then it wasn&#39;t that much helpful. She could see some grey walls and hear the sound of water running alongside a stench that reaffirm that she would need a long and warm shower once this was over.  Yet her thoughs were interrupted by that same monster she had smashed before appearing before her, she pulled her guns at it on instinct, she knew that thing was sturdy but then it was just a matter of putting enough bullets in it. 

Yet as she waited for it to jump at her just like it had before he just started to just trash around. Such behavior confused Gloria in many way as she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what that thing was and what sort of sick mind could create something like that. 

Then a familiar sound came, one she was used to hearing and understood the situation right away and all she could think about it was...

&#39;Crap&#39; she though. 

&quot;Collection?&quot; she said as she raised her hands in surrender, the gun was on the back of her neck so her options were quite limited. She could risk and see if she was fast enough to grab it before he shot her but the other monster would probably not make it easy.

He had taken off his footwear to walk on barefoot as it allows him to eliminate the sound of his footsteps, taking advantage of the darkness and silence of the sewers. It&#39;s only natural for someone like him to do so.

There was no need to be told to look for Gloria as that was what he was doing to begin with, but knowing that she&#39;s in trouble gives Saber a sense of urgency. Just on time, as Saber turned a corner and stepped forwards a bit, he could make out the silhouettes of two humanoid figures. Is that them? Saber wondered.

A good shot cannot be made with such little visuals, have to close in... but it does not hurt to aim at one of the two. Saber sheathed his sword behind him and placed both of his hands on his pistol to help make a stable shot. He&#39;s hoping that the other one is the enemy Master so it won&#39;t hurt to try a human tool to neutralize them.

 &lt;Master, I believe I see you and another person. Which one are you?&gt;

Both his hands on the gun, he steadily closed in to get a clearer view, changing his target as he goes about his little tacticool thing. A clean headshot will do just the trick, they&#39;re human after all. I can just take my time to guarantee my attempt, no pressure, Saber thought to himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, so long as you aren&#39;t dead yet. Need you to keep pumping me with mana after all.&gt;</em> He added, running in the darkness as he got closer to Lachlan&#39;s approximate location. During the time that took, his Master kept feeding him with more info: The enemy Master could use flames, so random flashes of light were something he needed to be wary of. Leapfrog was also being sent in his direction, albeit he had no clue on where he&#39;d come from, just the vague noise of thumps and the beast&#39;s erratic breathing.

The most important nugget however was the fact that Lachlan was currently holding the enemy Master down at gunpoint. In other words, the Master wasn&#39;t dead yet.

<em>&lt;What are you waiting for? Shoot her!&gt;</em> Bill immediately shouted in his Master&#39;s mind. In his eyes, there was no point in keeping Gloria alive. <em>&lt;You did this at the graveyard too! Just shoot her!&gt;</em> He insisted, increasing the pace in an effort to finish the job if Lachlan didn&#39;t come through. Unfortunately for him, he came across something else: He could see Lachlan and Gloria in the distance, illuminated by a faint light. A shadow blocked his path, however, being none other than Saber who had already taken aim at Lachlan from afar.

<em>&lt;Just like I thought,&gt;</em> Bill grumbled. <em>&lt;That bastard of a Saber has you down in his sights. Don&#39;t move, keep pointing your gun at his Master.&gt;</em> He communicated to Lachlan before slowly advancing. He took out his gun and marched towards Saber, pointing it right at the back of the Servant&#39;s head.

&quot;Ya really thought you could get on the drop on my Master? From the back, even?&quot; He taunted, readying the hammer with a satisfying <em>click</em>. He then raised his head and made sure that both Gloria and Lachlan could see him from afar thanks to his enormous hat.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109852406956703744 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109852406956703744><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 9:37 AM">9:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Nice little Mexican standoff we got ourselves in! You shoot me or my buddy, I shoot you and your lil&#39; friend over there. Sounds good?&quot; He laughed loudly, putting himself within Saber&#39;s range. Although it was a risky maneuver for an Archer, it came with the highest reward: The slightest movement Saber made would result in Bill pulling the trigger. If he prioritized protecting himself, it meant leaving Gloria at the mercy of Archer&#39;s Master. A rather tight situation to be in.

&quot;Now, I&#39;m not really one who enjoys violence,&quot; Bill yapped as he affirmed control over the situation. &quot;so don&#39;t go forcing my hand. Maybe if you just drop this fight and go home, you can leave with your dignity. Hmmmm?&quot; He proposed, tapping the back of Saber&#39;s head with his pistol.

Of course, Bill&#39;s true plans were far from that. <em>&lt;Say, Master, how long for that Pyg of yours to get here?&gt;</em> He asked while casting a side glance at the shadows behind Lachlan and Gloria. <em>&lt;And where&#39;s Leapfrog?

Same difference.&gt; He roughly lumped the cowboy together with the puppet Bill had just called &#39;fat&#39;, hoping that would shut him up for good. 

After all, what did Bill know about the intricacies of puppetry? There was much more to Pyg than just excess weight. In fact, Pyg wasn&#39;t even its full name. Lachlan simply preferred the shorthand, considering the other half of the puppet&#39;s body still remained back in the States.

In hindsight, he had made a prudent decision to split the puppet up. The current Pyg was perfectly sized, inconspicuous enough to pass off as a truck under tarps in the parking lot, yet substantial enough to pack a punch. Today had reaffirmed his choice as well, as Pyg had proven itself by maneuvering through the sewer system effortlessly, without any risk of getting stuck in the tunnels.

The faint tremors that Bill had detected earlier had come from the creature. It persisted, growing more and more discernible with each passing moment. Saber, being barefoot, would be even more attuned to the rhythmic vibrations on the floor.

<em>THUMP</em>

A few small pieces of rubble fell from the ceiling, clattering to the ground. There was no doubt about it. Something huge was stirring underground. A massive, slow moving presence was steadily advancing through the labyrinthine sewers, drawing closer all the while...

To add insult to injury, Bill had dredged up the graveyard fight as well, a blemish that Lachlan had tried to forget. The fact that he was being held at gunpoint by a Servant - a Saber, no less - only intensified his frustration. Why couldn&#39;t he act decisively, like Bill would have? Why couldn&#39;t he turn his brain off, and employ the good old &#39;shoot first, ask questions later&#39; approach?

<em>&lt;Do you want me to shoot or not?!&gt;</em> He shouted back, trying to mask his nervousness and pass it off as irritation. <em>&lt;God damn it, Bill. I thought <strong>you</strong> were the Archer here!&gt;</em>

Of course, his outburst was merely a distraction from the impending danger of getting his own brains blown out. He caught a glimpse of Gloria&#39;s face, faintly illuminated by the guns lying on the ground. Were they glowing? A cheap trick, perhaps, but it seemed to be how she managed to signal the Saber.

Well, two can play that game, he supposed. If Gloria was keen to mark their position, then he could very well create a distraction of his own. And conveniently, there happened to be a perfect decoy lying at her feet.

He turned his attention to the woman.

&#39;I made the thing, yes. But I didn&#39;t come up with the design. My great-great-grandma did.&#39; He confessed his &#39;crimes&#39; as Gloria threw a peculiar question his way. &#39;To be honest, I was too preoccupied with the fear of messing up the design to think about much else...&#39; 

He answered her at face value. &#39;I think I did alright though,&#39; he added, then mustered some semblance of a fake smile, though the dim lighting made it hard to discern. &#39;The least you could do is witness the fruits of my labor.&#39;

Blinded by the darkness, the puppet charged forward recklessly. The overpowering stench of the sewage waste interfered with its sense of smell as well, further disorienting its perception of the surroundings. In its mindless rampage, it zeroed in on the only other source of sound that reached its ears — the presence of the Servants.

She could blame Saber but she was well aware it was her own fault for letting the brat get one over her and to be fair the situation wasn&#39;t as bad as it could be. Part of the risk she had been wanting to avoid had been somewhat dealt with. At the very least now she knew where the enemy servant was but it was just like Bill had mentioned before, this was a stand off. 

As she tried to figure out the best way to deal with the situation she couldn&#39;t help but felt concerned about the tremor she felt slowly coming closer and closer. 

&lt;It seems we only have one shot at this Saber&gt; she said through their mental link. &lt;We each have to attack at the same time that is the only way to deal with the current situation, wait for my signal&gt;

Yeah, there was a weakness she could exploit in Lachlan. While she was being held at gunpoint she heard the young man talk and listen carefully to what he told her as she hoped for him to let something slip about the killer. He didn&#39;t but through his words she gain some insight of him, well just little the rest was just her own bias filling the blank spaces so this plan of her was another big gamble. 

&quot;Your grandma, no your family has a really bizarre taste&quot; it wasn&#39;t an insult towards their craft but more like an observation. 

Then Leapfrog began to move, it moved past them with great speed and towards Saber and Bill. Was this the best opening? It was hard to know but she had to risk it. As the beast move in an erratic way the debris and damp waste he send away actually force her to move. She reached for her coat aiming to protect her face from the dirty disposal water before she actually took it off and threw it at Lachlan face. 

&lt;Now Saber!!&gt; For Gloria the only solution was an issue of timing and the sudden chaos brough forth due to that puppet was their best chance to break out of the situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Hey have you ever shot that gun?&quot; she asked as she moved as fast as she could to retrieve her own guns. The trick with her coat was merely a distraction so she get them back and position herself better and avoid being shot by Lachlan.

—Awfully close too.&quot;

Saber did not seem at all phased by Archer&#39;s threat, but still he remained frozen, not out of fear but to see if an opportunity would arise. Right, while the position he got himself in is rather inconvenient, all he needs to do is just wait. And wait. And wait. And wait. While Saber could pull the trigger and get rid of the Master, the Servant won&#39;t disappear instantly. Archer could finish the job before he too disappears or until <em>something</em> happens.

 &quot;Spirits lurk in these places I heard, one could be behind you right now, Archer.&quot;

The attempt is painfully obvious though, in a way, it can be interpreted as Saber subtly insulting Archer. It&#39;s not like Saber has anything else to do other than to wait some more or to conclude the fight early; to pull the trigger. Saber, of course, will wait for as long as needed for an opportunity to show up.

Saber never paid much attention to it, but it is getting hard to ignore. The ground, as level as it looks, feels rather unstable. He wonders if it is because he&#39;s barefoot and that he is going to slip, though, hearing what the Master said, it could be something else entirely.

Thinking about this gave Saber some kind of countdown to misfortune, but upon hearing what Gloria suggested, it turned into a countdown to opportunity. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111562263879503892 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111562263879503892><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 26, 2023 2:51 AM">2:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>An attack in tandem would do just the trick, yeah, that&#39;s a really good one.

That sure is a mean looking spirit. Saber is going to need to protect himself somehow, the question in his head is to pull out the sword or to pull out a little trick. Right, let&#39;s just play it safe and use the sword like a good Saber, how he goes about doing that though...

Saber ducked to deliver Archer an elbow to the gut, planning to knock the wind out of him, as he went to unsheathe his blade. He feels as if he should really go get his footwear back, but he must make sure Gloria is safe first. Saber went to stick to the wall, still maintaining a low profile, hoping to evade that <em>thing</em> and let it deal with Archer for now. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Apparently it was even worse back in the war, stories of men stationed at hills and mountains with nothing more than a rifle and a good set of eyes. Their knees were stuck to the ground as they stood still for hours at a time, just to get a good shot on a target.

Bill was never about that life. He wanted clean, fast shots. If he couldn&#39;t have them, he would rather not shoot at all and run away. While Lachlan barraged his mind with more insults and Saber taunted him with childish tales of ghosts, Bill was fidgeting with his pistol, his fingers practically screaming at him to pull the trigger. He would have done it, were it not for Lachlan. Unlike any other disposable gang member, a Master was essential for a Servant. Besides, after the talk they had a while back, he couldn&#39;t exactly afford those sort of risks anymore. Patience had become a virtue.

<em>&lt;I&#39;m waiting. Don&#39;t let me down now, boss.&gt;</em> Bill replied to Lachlan&#39;s rants while trying his best to ignore Saber&#39;s mocking. He was waiting on Pyg, who was Lachlan&#39;s supposed ace in the hole, and judging by the quaking in his boots and the tremors reverberating across the sewers, they were close. So very close.

But Pyg wasn&#39;t the only tool at Lachlan&#39;s disposal.

&quot;I&#39;m closer and louder than you&#39;d hope, Saber.&quot; Bill replied, keeping his gun pressed on Saber&#39;s head. He wasn&#39;t oblivious to the art of confident small talk, which could usually lower the guard of inept officers back in the day. There was no way Bill would fall for such a trick-

Then Leapfrog made its presence known, stomping and thrashing its polymorphic body across the sewer walls. It had gone into a rampage, unable to tell friend and foe apart in such a horrid environment. Lachlan couldn&#39;t afford spending a portion of his attention on the creature, since all of his focus had now gone to Pyg and Gloria. Plus, he had already warned Bill ages ago: Leapfrog was <em>his</em> horse now.

And just like that, it returned to its owner. Or, to be more accurate, it charged straight at them like a dog in heat. Saber sensed the tide of the wind changing as he elbowed Bill in a moment of weakness, the cowboy too preoccupied with Leapfrog&#39;s erratic movement to notice the subtle change in Saber&#39;s own movements.

&quot;Urk!&quot; Bill coughed, gasping for breath a bit as the Saber moved out of the way. Instead of capitalizing on the cowboy&#39;s destruction, they planned on letting Leapfrog do the deed while they instead focused their attention on Gloria.

&quot;Big mistake.&quot; Bill flashed a snide grin, a drop of blood trickling from his masked mouth as Leapfrog was now falling on him. Direct contact was imminent, so why was he smiling?

With a skip and a jump, Bill kicked himself off a wall and landed directly on the large puppet. He grabbed at it in something resembling a bear hug, only to stretch his legs around the creature and saddle it like some sort of circus beast. Leapfrog was nothing more than an overgrown horse and Bill treated it as such, allowing him to avoid the puppet&#39;s wrath by instead deciding on where that wrath would be directed towards.

Right now the prime target was Saber, the cowboy aiming down his sights as he now held the advantage of a higher vantage point thanks to Leapfrog&#39;s height. It would have been an easy task for him to shoot at Saber, hence why he-

<em>BANG!</em>

Shot at a wall instead.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112809756193738913 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112809756193738913><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 29, 2023 1:28 PM">1:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Leapfrog snarled, feeling stressed and confused at the sudden noise of gunfire. It thrashed about, forcing Bill to kick it with his spuds and use the pain to calm it down. &quot;Easy there, big fella! Was already a pain in the ass to get on top of you, so don&#39;t kick me off just yet!&quot; Bill scolded. He didn&#39;t seem to care about his bullet missing, which confused Saber...Until he saw the bullet&#39;s trajectory and realized that it had all been planned.

Instead of piercing through the wall, Bill had shot it at the perfect angle to have it ricochet off the wall&#39;s edge, now heading towards Gloria instead and aiming to penetrate her back. Lungs, spine, shoulders. Those vital areas were at risk, especially when involving a bullet fired by a Servant.

&quot;Where you looking at?&quot; But Bill wasn&#39;t done with Saber yet. After all, Leapfrog was still running around, except now Bill was guiding it through his own Riding skill. The puppet was no longer blind, now charging straight ahead for Saber&#39;s general location. The latter had put their back on a wall, essentially cornering themselves in the face of Bill&#39;s attack.

&quot;You think you saw spirits, didya? The only spirit I see here is yours from beyond the grave! Kahahahahah!&quot; Bill howled, firing a repeating volley of shots while Leapfrog charged ahead. There was no need for fancy gunplay or precise shots while shooting on horseback: The threat of the horse stampeding all over someone&#39;s face was already scary enough. Saber would know a thing or two about that.  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that any of our partners have ever felt the need to!&#39;

Impatiently, he rolled up the cloak into a tight ball and cast it aside. Gloria had chosen to chew him out once more, this time mimicking his dear Archer and delivering a jab to his weapons handling. Those words got another snicker out of him, though this time it was tinged with a hint of irritation. So, everyone who had ever held a gun felt entitled to lecture wherever and whenever they wanted, did they?

&#39;Let&#39;s not dwell on that,&#39; he said roughly as he tracked Gloria&#39;s movements with his ears. &#39;After all, firing a gun isn&#39;t exactly <em>difficult</em>.&#39;

Amidst the darkness-engulfed sewers, the faint glow emanating from Gloria&#39;s guns acted as a beacon. This worked well in Lachlan&#39;s favor, as the limited visual distractions from the environment allowed his eyes to zero in on the luminous targets. Judging by the sound of her footsteps, the woman was making a beeline for her weapons, which made things easier. Lachlan swiftly readied his gun—

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

Simultaneously, he and his Servant fired, the shots overlapping in symphony as each bullet streaked towards their respective targets. Lachlan&#39;s bullet flew unerringly towards the source of the glow—that being the first of Gloria&#39;s guns—striking it with pinpoint accuracy and sending the stationary object spiraling off in a new direction. With a quick reload, he aimed at the second gun, intending to replicate the same feat—

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Bill&#39;s bullet struck the sewer wall with incredible force, shattering the concrete into fragments before it ricocheted and sped off in Gloria&#39;s direction. A temporary silence hung in the air as the distant thumping momentarily ceased, but even that was short-lived.

The creature lurking in the sewers, alerted by Bill&#39;s gunshot, was no longer dragging its feet. It now charged towards the source of the noise with thunderous footfalls, each one striking the ground with tremendous force.

<em>Thump. Thump. THUMP.</em> The ground trembled under the creature&#39;s advance, its monstrous size becoming increasingly evident with each step. Even Leapfrog tensed up momentarily in response to this impending threat, and were it not for Bill&#39;s ironclad grip and unwavering commands, it surely would have frozen in place and succumbed to its innate fear.

<em><strong>THUMP.</strong></em> The wall quivered violently as an immense forced crashed against it from the other side. The creature attacked it like a massive battering ram and the wall, already tenderized by Bill&#39;s bullet, crumbled like a tower made of cards.

<strong>Pygmalion had finally arrived.</strong> 

And what monstrosity it was, a nightmarish amalgamation of flesh and bone, twisted limbs, misshapen torsos, and distorted appendages. Dozens of humans must have been used as raw materials in its creation, their bodies dismembered, then sewn back together with invisible stitches that only served to accentuate its uncanniness. The boundaries between the various sections blurred into an incomprehensible mass, making it nearly impossible to discern where one limb ended and another began.

But perhaps that was precisely the point. As the creature crushed a block of concrete under its massive hand, a tangle of limbs coiled and contorted in perfect synchrony, as if they had been melded into a singular arm. The same pattern repeated throughout the rest of its body as it lumbered forward: legs comprised of various human legs propelled each other with an eerie coordination, occasionally emitting a <em>crack!</em> or a <em>pop!</em> from one of its many joints.

He lowered his gun against better judgment, as his focus was forced to shift completely onto the colossal puppet. Pyg&#39;s arrival demanded his undivided attention, as its mere presence exerted an oppressive weight upon his psyche. A dozen voices screamed in his mind, and it took all he had to keep them at bay. Then, bit by bit, he channeled his own thoughts back into the puppet, and began to drown its multiple minds with his own thoughts...

<em>&#39;no more of this make it stop please spare me make it stop i wish i could die instead of—&#39;</em>

<em><strong>&#39;LISTEN TO ME!&#39;</strong></em> Lachlan pushed forward with every ounce of strength he could muster with his mind. Veins popped on his neck, cold sweat prickled across his back; commanding a dozen minds simultaneously, arranging their tasks and forcing them to operate in harmony, that was no easy feat. Normally, even the most skilled puppeteer required ample amounts of rest several nights in advance before they could even hope to fully control a puppet of this caliber. Unfortunately, Lachlan had no such luxury.

<em><strong>&#39;REMEMBER WHO YOU BELONG TO!&#39;</strong></em> He pushed harder. 

<em>&#39;i am pygmalion i am the occupant of this body i am going to kill i am going to...to kill...&#39;</em>

<em><strong>&#39;THE WOMAN,&#39;</strong></em> Lachlan set his sight on Gloria&#39;s dim silhouette once more. <em><strong>&#39;KILL THE WOMAN.&#39;</strong></em>

<em>&#39;yes...kill...kill the woman...kill...then make it stop&#39;</em>

<em><strong>&#39;YOU KNOW YOU MUST,&#39;</strong></em> he coaxed the creature. <em><strong>&#39;THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT STOP.&#39;</strong></em>

&#39;yes i must make it stop stop stop stop <em>stop</em> <em>STOP</em>—&#39;

<em><strong>SMASH!</strong></em>

A shrill, discordant shriek, unbefitting of its massive size, erupted from the monstrous entity. The sewer trembled as the creature lashed out with an arm as thick as a tree trunk, aiming directly for the glowing gun that revealed the location of its target: Gloria.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112869580298256475 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112869580298256475><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 29, 2023 5:26 PM">5:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yes if one were to consider only the physical aspect firing a gun is something relative easy to do. Even kids with no knowledge can easily learn how to do it and so in that aspect Lachlan words were not wrong. 

Yet, just because they weren&#39;t wrong meant he was right. Life is rarely so simple as to allow the lack of something be proof of the opposite. For her who had hold a gun for most of her life the act of shooting was not something easy by any means. Experience had taught Gloria that to pull the trigger and end a life one either needed a strong will or blissfull ignorance. As pulling the trigger is easy but dealing with the consequences of such action was not something everyone could do.  But at the same time it was really easy to not pay mind to such things and just take things at face value. 

Yet Gloria couldn&#39;t do something so simple, she who had stared at the abyss couldn&#39;t afford to look away from her actions. Part of her wished she could just not care, in a way she envied how some could feel no remorse nor guilt and even seem to enjoy the act of killing. 

But it was hard to blame her, the moment she felt that small hand grasping one of her fingers. The moment she saw him slowly open his eyes and cry she realize that going back into blissful ignorance was no longer possible for her. 

&quot;Yes is not difficult&quot; she said as she saw how one of her handguns was blow away  &quot;But is not easy either if so you would have shot me already&quot; 

One can only shot at one target at a time, had it been her she rather shoot at the user instead of the weapon but guess that the kid is either being quite confident or lack some real world experience. She can still be sure its either, it could just be that he just want to let his servant do the killing? It doesnt&#39; matter she will just do as she always done and take the chance. Can she reach the second gun before he blows it away or not it was just as simple.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She remains still as she heard the sound of something coming. She could hear her heart beating out of her own chest  Her insticts were telling her to get the hell away, that whatever was coming was something it was better to no get involved with but in this situation with so many other dangers running wasn&#39;t an option. 

The wall crashed and a beast which Gloria could only describe as an amalgamation of bodies. It was disgusting it was bizarre and more than anything it was dangerous. Gloria felt that she could stare at it for hours and no matter how long she wouldn&#39;t be able to understood what that being was.

For once there was no options, there was only 1 things she could do. The fact that she was pushed to such corner was quite irritating.  

&quot;Let my soul burn...&quot; she said as she closed her eyes. For some it may look like she was accepting her fate but that was far from it. 

Flames surrounded her, they coated her body completely and it suddenly began to expand the flames began to build something, growing and shaping themselves into a form no one had ever seen. The tunnel was soon filled with a crimson glow which let Gloria had a better look at the monster coming at her but it also let Lachlan saw what he was facing. 

A demon made out of fire, only half of his body had appeared but that was enough, even when it was smaller than Pyg he was just as imposing. The face of such demon would look at Lachlan and smile as it 4 arms stood ready to recieve the beast charge. The rock around it was melting the dirty water was boiling, this was Gloria last resort.

They’re good. Like, really really good. Too good even. It’s difficult to make sense of anything when everything seems to be happening at once. What can be done when there are two, three distinct and formidable opponents all attacking at once? All Saber really needs to do is to do what he does best, to cut them down. He would do that but he just can’t, really.

Why? Why can’t he? Thing is, he has to realize he is not alone and that he is not just responsible for his life but for another’s too. Knowing that the enemy Servant will take opportunities to set their Master up in order to kill Gloria, it is only natural for Saber to try to keep the Servant at bay while he too does the same to the enemy Master as well…

Right, the gun. Saber can and will be using the gun to the best he can but he knows human constructs cannot do anything significant to a Servant. Something needs to be done here, but he needs to position himself in a way that allows him to do so. Ahh, this stressful thinking really hurts the head. Snapping back after being deep in thought, he just realized that another ‘thing’ just entered the fight as well, that makes four distinct foes now. Something is also coming at him too.

Talking can come later, just need to get this one out of the way.

Saber could not help but notice his back feeling warm before it got really hot with the sewer environment lit up with a fiery vermillion color. Thought to look back but he did not need to, that voice implies it is who he thinks is causing this change in temperature. Cover her back, huh, Saber will do just that.

This heat and atmosphere is a familiar feeling to Saber, reminds him of something but that’ll be for another time. He can do something similar however. As Saber anticipates for Archer to return, he hovers his pistol on the edge of his sword. Sliding, the wind around it begins to swirl, a light sucking force could be felt before it calmed down. Saber never thought he’d ever need to use his abilities in a fight, but, after all that has happened, its use is warranted.

 ”Alright Archer, I wonder where you are now.”

Saber muttered to himself as he continued anticipating Archer&#39;s reappearance. Will they bust through the wall like the other one before them? Perhaps they’ll come out where they came from, hm?

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Bill took a glance to his side, watching rubble fall down and dust follow its wake. An enormous shadow followed suit, limbs vibrating endlessly like wild waves in the ocean, communicating with each other as one full organism manipulated by a single mind. Lachlan barked orders at the monstrous puppet known as &#39;Pyg&#39;, dominating the behemoth with his authority as the beast immediately directed its attacks towards Gloria. The enemy Master was putting up a valiant effort, but Bill knew for a fact that his ricocheted bullet was headed straight for her. This would end in a matter of seconds.

<em>&lt;That&#39;s a big dog. You been feeding it much?&gt;</em> Bill asked a harmless joke, but received only static from Lachlan&#39;s mind. No doubt his Master was too busy controlling that mass of flesh. The outlaw instead shook his head and turned back to his opponent, only to witness Saber make a run for it instead of facing him head on.

&quot;Hey you-&quot; He shouted, but had to pull the brakes on Leapfrog with a light kick on the side. He quickly turned, pursuing Saber with only a few feet away from his target. It seemed like the Servant was intent on regrouping with their Master, who now had a brilliant sheen of flames surrounding their body. Most people would have focused on that, but Bill ignored it. After all, he knew that something else was coming.

<em>ZZIP!</em>

The sound of a bullet tearing cloth and penetrating flesh. It felt silent compared to Pyg&#39;s snarls, to the point Saber only realized that he had been hit seconds after the bullet had emerged from the back of his ribs. A gaping hole was now between his chest and stomach, oozing blood and wetting his clothing. More blood dripped from his mouth as he now realized that the initial bullet to the wall wasn&#39;t a miss: Saber had been aiming for Gloria all along, and he had been caught into the crossfire.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113920357674524743 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113920357674524743><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 3:01 PM">3:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He had protected his Master at least, but at what cost? All he could see was Archer speeding up towards him with his bestial hound.

&quot;Look at you now! Not so cool and calm when you&#39;re spilling your guts over, hmmmm?&quot; Bill taunted, raining down on Saber&#39;s morale. &quot;I&#39;m glad you brought me back to your Master: Just means I get to kill both of you at once.&quot;

He kicked Leapfrog again, angering it and making it take a full on charge at the duo. He then released his hold on the beast&#39;s neck, instead grabbing two guns from his waist and crossing his arms into an X. One gun was pointed at Gloria, the other to Saber.

&quot;Sorry, boss. But I&#39;m stealing your kill!&quot; Bill cackled, loud enough for his enemies to hear as he pulled the trigger.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Six bullets, followed by six more. A symphony of lead proceeded to zigzag across the sewers, projectiles clashing into each other and forming a rain of shrapnel and stray bullets with no set trajectory. Instead of aiming at both individually, Bill took the lazy approach and turned his bullets into a blanket of concentrated damage. It would have been incredibly hard for Saber to protect his Master from this attack, not unless he invested his entire body into being a shield.

Which is exactly what Bill was counting on, as he shook his hat and caused spare bullets to fall down his pistol. He slowly reloaded, patiently waiting for Saber to make a move as Leapfrog was now just a few feet away from colliding with the swordsman.

<em>&quot;C&#39;mon...Show me your butt.&quot;</em> He thought with a devilish grin impressed on his face. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan had never shot to kill. 

The act of pulling the trigger—of ending another man&#39;s existence—was a burden that not many had the resolve to bear. Shooting inanimate targets at a range, butchering livestock for sustenance...those were vastly different from the act of snuffing out a fellow human being&#39;s life. 

Humanity held itself distinct from the other organisms. They were not mere livestock, nor commodities to be slaughtered without remorse. They possessed a unique value that set themselves apart. Lachlan believed this with every fiber of his being. After all, the puppets he created...

They went far beyond the tasteless, <em>lifeless</em> abominations, the so-called &#39;familiars&#39; sought after by other mages. Each and every Skinwalker was a sublime transformation of those who came before, <em>repurposed</em> into something extraordinary. The essence of their humanity, though rearranged, still coursed through their veins. They were not dead but reborn, united as something greater than the sum of their parts. And for this purpose, the original humans were always meant to <em>live</em>.

Thus, Lachlan J. Dowling could not be labeled a murderer. His conscience remained clean, untarnished by the guilt of taking a life. Why should he feel guilty, when he had so many others to dirty their hands for him? Roland Bleier, Cherokee Bill, Leapfrog, The Dancer, Pygmalion—all were instruments of his will, the executioners of his demands. And let us not forget the corporate parasites who commissioned the puppets from his family, fully aware of the materials being used and the purpose they served, going so far as to help acquire the &#39;assets&#39; <em>for</em> him... 

Gloria was right. Lachlan had never shot to kill. Never faced the moral dilemma of directly ending a life. Never had the need to, as such was the essence of being a puppeteer. So long as <em>someone</em> was there to do it for him, someone like—</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 4:02 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114294351326097429 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114294351326097429><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 3:47 PM">3:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

The gigantic beast lunged at Supay, crashing them both into the wall like a wrecking ball. The impact was so extreme that the entire sewer began to quake in the aftershock, so extreme that Pyg, along with Supay and by extension, Gloria, were sent hurling into the adjacent tunnel, then the tunnel beyond, their bodies colliding and grappling like two colossal drunkards who&#39;d lost their way around a bar.

For a brief moment, there was silence. Lachlan tore his mind away from Pyg&#39;s lingering bloodlust to survey the damage in front of him. <em>Had Pyg done the deed?</em> The tunnel ahead of him flickered...

...only to ignite with a surge of fiery flames as Gloria&#39;s voice pieced through. The woman shouted something fierce, and the fire giant, in all of its crackling, sizzling glory, began to heat up the space as all four its arms glowed with an ominous radiance.

Then it raised its arms and brought them crashing down on Pyg.

A Dowling-manufactured war machine like Pygmalion, Lachlan knew, had been meticulously designed to withstand a direct hit from most A-ranked Mystic Codes. He knew this because he had been present during the countless tests Pyg had undergone during its production, and had personally saw to the administration of many of the drugs that had fortified its flesh. Every bone, ligament, and muscle had been reinforced with magecraft to render it spectacularly resilient. Centuries of research at the Dowling mansion had birthed this abomination so that it could traverse the depths of hell and come back in one piece.

Yet, as Supay&#39;s scorching fists collided with Pyg, Lachlan quickly realized that the centuries of research at the Dowling mansion were sorely in need of a goddamned upgrade.

It was as if an ancient inferno had been unleashed upon the puppet, with each of its fists surging with an impossible heat and engulfed in an aberrant flame that defied the modern rules of magecraft. The flames, unlike anything he&#39;d tested before, seared Pyg&#39;s flesh with ease. Even from the safety of the adjacent tunnel, Lachlan watched as his puppet was reduced to a squealing mess. He listened as the dozen or so minds operating within Pyg&#39;s body erupted in a cacophony of pain: the skin on its neck boiled, the ligaments on its stomach torn...

<strong>&#39;PYG!&#39;</strong> Lachlan snarled. He raised his gun and sent a bullet right into the back of Pyg&#39;s protruding forehead. <strong>&#39;I didn&#39;t create you to whine like a coward! Concentrate, or I&#39;ll have you discarded like trash before this night is through!&#39;</strong>

Pyg staggered backwards...then righted itself. Lachlan&#39;s &#39;whipping&#39; had taken its effect. Though Supay&#39;s flames had caught it off guard once, it primary fear had always been the small metal instrument clenched tight between the puppeteer&#39;s fingers. <em>Yes...it would do anything to avoid being reprimanded...avoid being taken apart again...</em>

With a roar the beast retaliated, disregarding the flames licking its body as it seized Supay by the shoulders and forcefully drove it into the ground. 

Blow after blow rained down upon Supay, each strike a repayment in kind. Pyg utilized every tool in its arsenal, unleashing a barrage of punches, kicks, and stomps upon its opponent. And where the limbs failed to reach, it supplemented with headbutts. The searing heat inflicted by Supay&#39;s assault only fueled Pyg&#39;s own retaliation, as it struck back several-fold more. Its speed escalated with each passing moment, as all of its bone and sinew began to work in perfect harmony like a well-oiled machine...

Until finally, Lachlan stopped fine-tuning his commands. He watched as Pyg continued to operate on full autonomy.

<strong>&#39;Like hell you are!&#39;</strong> Lachlan cackled. He stood at the tunnel&#39;s edge, feeling the impact of Pyg&#39;s punches not just through the shockwaves crashing through the air, but as if they were his own. Chest heaving with anticipation, face flushed with heat, eyes wide with manic excitement...he was lost in the throes of Pyg&#39;s bloodlust, a primal joy overtaking his psyche as the mental connection between them blurred the lines between puppet and puppeteer...

Puppetry, in its intoxicating frenzy, was one hell of a drug. And even as Bill attempted to establish a telepathic connection with his Master, what awaited him on the other end was nothing but the raw consciousness of a raving beast, incapable of coherent communication...He was exposed to the mind of Pyg.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114294611557490750 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114294611557490750><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 3:48 PM">3:48 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But what was what she had conjured? From a normal stand point it was just like any of the constructions which Gloria had created before. And while that wasn&#39;t wrong it wasn&#39;t accurate either, regular Ignis magecraft worked through the use of mental images. Images the user used as a guide to give the flames form without the need of deep concentration nor time. But that was not a method without any deficencies, if one were to pay attention they would notice that none of the constructions Gloria made was the same. The mental image served as a sort of outline for the user to use but because it was just an outline that made the image unstable. 

The amount and time their constructions could last were limited even for those who were talented in shaping flames. Yet as the fire giant fists smashed the beast in front of it there was no crack, there was no difference as if a real giant was standing there protecting Gloria.  That was the Ignis ultimate magecraft, each member Supay was unique, it was a construction build from what each believe to be their ideal form. An idea given form based on their personalities and will. 

Gloria was weak, her arms and legs were thin and even kids could physically overpower her if they put their mind into it. She wanted power, the wanted strenght in order to protect her family and burn those who wished to take away from her. She wanted something which would keep her from losing anything anymore. A really childish notion and wish,  as living is to lose, to live is to take part in a fight rigged against you. 

Funny thing is, Gloria understood that yet she couldn&#39;t help but wish for the impossible. That is why her ideal form, the idea which she would bet everything she had was giant of power. 

A barrage of blows came, her sudden burst of power and action was something Lachlan could not expect and so Pyg was taken by surprise.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gloria&#39;s mind was currently occupied by no though but destroying that being in front of her. 

<em>Crack</em>

Supay was powerful but even if it was the ultime magecraft of her clan it didn&#39;t came without any issues. To materialize such powerful image, to give it shape and use continuously put a big strain on the user brain. 

<em>Crack</em>

Blood began to fall like a crimsom tear from the corner of Gloria&#39;s eyes and nose as she gritted her teeth as her giant continue to fight without giving a single each. Each blow, send a ting on her head, she felt her head ready to explode and yet she refused to back down at any point.

<em>Crack</em>

No in fact Supay movement were slowly becoming faster, getting used to the violent barrage of Pyg with each passing second. Gloria experience and will was slowly giving it an edge over a beast which moved without thinking as unlike with Pyg Gloria was not controlling Supay from afar but with Supay surrounding it she was in the front lines.

&quot;Not enough! This isnt enough yet!!&quot; she yelled as Supay continue to fight. The giant was beginning to exhibit crack over its body. Even if this was more stable than other constructions, there is a limit to everything, just being more stable didn&#39;t meant it couldn&#39;t be destroyed. 

Gloria was taking another bet, would she be able to make Supay overwhelm Pyg of she would run out of steam.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114378411838816316 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114378411838816316><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 9:21 PM">9:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And her gamble paid off, as while she had no way of knowing each blow was having an effect on Lachlan mind.

As Pyg leaned forward with a headbutt Gloria made Supay lean back making Pyg miss just by a few inches and in that small opening two of Supay arms streched and reached under it chin. 

&quot;Ignia!!!&quot; Crimson flames shine as the fist made contact as a beam of fire came of the fist burning the beast face Gloria was not holding anything back. The flames went beyond Pyg face and burned the broken celing. From the outside a pillar of crimson light could be seen rising into the sky.

What a familiar sight, he thought to himself as he took a look at the consequences of his mistake due to oversight. Though, had Saber intercepted the bullet, would it be any better than what has occurred to him now? Does not matter, however something to question is… was that even the same bullet? Where did it come from?

Wiping the blood off his mouth, he went to look at Archer taunting him for his clumsiness. To kill both of them at once, hmm, with how the players are positioned, it’s very much possible and a real threat. Saber is going to have to step up his game if he and Gloria are to get out of this in one piece, and step up he will.

 ”Nice shot, pardner. You got me good, real good.
—But that’ll be the only shot you’ll ever land on me.”

Saber returned to how he was posed earlier, shrugging off what had just happened. Just a flesh wound, he thought. However, as courageous as he can be, he cannot afford to take another bullet anywhere on his body. To do just that is just a matter of how much pressure he can put on Archer.

He took note of Archer&#39;s new aggressive approach in their interactions. Now that Archer is sort of a bigger and, perhaps, less agile target now that he is on his steed, meaning that, Saber won’t have to worry about precision when it comes to his own firearm and that he will have an initially easier time when he gains back his turn again as Archer would potentially need to take extra seconds to turn around with his ride.

With a wall of lead making their way and a beast barreling towards him, Saber knew exactly what to do. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114401667287367811 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114401667287367811><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 10:54 PM">10:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This act will give him his turn back and potentially enable him to glue himself to Archer and apply pressure, just as he wanted to do in the beginning. As the threats continue on their attack in tandem, Saber triggers his reversal.

 ”A present for you!”

His sword, already whispering with air, started to swirl with wind ever so rapidly as it collected as much as it could within the blade for this one quick strike. In one fell swoop, he thrusted his sword and unleashed a torrent of concentrated wind with a subsequent slipstream, blowing Archer and his steed back and slowing the wall of lead down to a mere sprinkle of pellets that could only lightly pelt the skin.

Taking initiative, Saber broke into a sprint as he went to close the distance. Now is his chance to start whaling on Archer as he has now changed the momentum literally and figuratively. Saber is going to need to make sure Archer never obtains a chance to effectively use his tools as he goes about his offense as that would mean getting pushed out and then going back to square one.

 ”Master, hope you don’t mind me taking this one on a walk. I trust your blazing familiar would even things out between you four.”

Saber said to Gloria as he went on the offense against Archer. Now that Saber has shown what his secret trick is, how will Archer respond to this little tweak in enemy interaction Saber made? This could go many ways, one thing’s for sure though, Saber is absolutely willing to rough Archer up the moment he could get his hands on him. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The familiar ringing in his ears that followed anytime he pulled the trigger at his poor targets, usually the sign of a freshly fired bullet coated in smoke and muzzle flashes. He would normally only use one bullet per target, but Gloria and Saber were a special case: When he really, <em>really</em> wanted someone dead, he was fond of emptying both guns.

Twelve bullets were headed for the Master-Servant duo, with Gloria far too preoccupied with Pyg to care about the incoming hail of lead. Saber was the only one who could intervene, but Bill had his eyes fixated on the swordsman. His gun was now loaded and ready to fire at the slightest movement.

That was until a sinister thought echoed in the crevice of his mind. Lachlan had responded to his message, though instead of the usual irritated and pompous tone, he had received something much more feral.

Actually, it wasn&#39;t even a telepathic command. He screamed it out loud, which was quite unusual considering their past conversations. He loved preserving energy anytime Bill chatted him up, usually resorting to telepathy more than words. Bill took a quick glance at his Master, noticing their blackened eyes, devilish grin and worst of all, immobile body like that of a sitting, overconfident duck. He immediately attempted to establish a telepathic link, only to get booed by the howls of a starving beast. Something that craved for blood.

<em>&quot;You&#39;ve gone and done it now.&quot;</em> Bill grunted in frustration. He too often lost himself in the lust of battle, but found it supremely annoying when someone else was doing it. There could only be so many loose cannons inside a cake, after all.

<em>&lt;Then kill them now, boss. Don&#39;t make me fucking shout at you.&gt;</em> Archer warned, though he was sure his message would fall under deaf ears. To avoid further problems, he refocused on Saber, ready to fill them with more bullets-

<em>WHOOOOOOSH</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114650537233760337 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114650537233760337><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 3:23 PM">3:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Only to watch Leapfrog be lifted in the air, along with him almost losing his hat as Saber unveiled one of their hidden techniques. Their blade flashed differently, held in a unique slicing motion that gathered the power of wind nearby. A powerful gale blanketed the rain of bullets, turning them into nothing more than sprinkles of dust while the puppet and its rider were launched backwards, crashing right into a wall.

&quot;Grrrr!&quot; Bill snarled like a mutt with rabies, kicking Leapfrog as well since the idiotic donkey had landed on his knees. <em>&quot;First the goddamn wolfman dodges all of my bullets like they&#39;re Jesus, now I get some guy that can swat me away like I&#39;m a fly?!&quot;</em> Archer wasn&#39;t exactly coping well with the current situation. Perhaps he should have realized several days earlier that he was punching way above his weight class.

But the most despicable thing about Cherokee Bill was the fact that his victories were unearned. He would win even if he wasn&#39;t the better man, even if he was a weak piece of shit. Saber would be just another testament to that.

A cloud of dust gathered from Saber&#39;s initial whirlwind which, combined with Gloria&#39;s reckless flames and Pyg&#39;s destruction, was enough to make everything rather foggy. After all, they were in a dark, cramped sewer that was barely lit up by a Master&#39;s flames.

&quot;And that&#39;s the last hit you&#39;ll ever get on me, <strong>punk.&quot;</strong> Bill taunted from the mist, hollering like a hyena as his laughter got gradually closer, echoed in, and then slowly vanished from Saber&#39;s ears. He could no longer tell where Bill was, especially in the midst of the chaos between Gloria and Pyg.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114650588492345425 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114650588492345425><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 3:23 PM">3:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>thump thump thump</em>

What he could hear, however, were footsteps. Strong and fierce, like those belonging to Pyg. A creature then emerged from the smoke, none other than Leapfrog which was charging at Saber like mad. On top of it was Archer as usual with his trademark hat. After all that mocking and bravado, he still resorted to a full-frontal assault? What a disappointment.

It would have been easy for Saber to summon up another storm. For him to slice Archer in two and cleanly bisect his flesh. The sooner he disposed of the Servant, the quicker he could get to defending Gloria from the enemy Master. He couldn&#39;t afford to play anymore.

That applied to <em>both</em> of them.

It took a while, especially with the tension and adrenaline in a fight, but Saber soon realized that he had <em>two</em> holes in his body now. A new, fresh wound had appeared in his stomach, clearly from a bullet as he started filling sick. Bill had shot him once again, yet there was no noise of gunfire, nor a muzzle flash.

&quot;Heheheheh.&quot; Only that irritating, creepy laughter that felt both close and far at the same time. It drove him mad to find Bill&#39;s location, especially in the chaos occurring nearby. And what of Leapfrog, who was still charging?

<em>thump</em>

It all made sense now. The hat unceremoniously dropped to the ground as Leapfrog had exerted itself a bit too much. That wasn&#39;t Bill on the puppet: It was a <strong>scarecrow.</strong> A metal pole that Bill had stabbed into his own ride to use as a dummy. His coat and hat were put on top, giving the illusion of a rider.

&quot;Any last words, punk?&quot; Saber heard, but saw no one around him. Leapfrog had also paused its stampede, almost as if someone had ordered it to stop.

<em>clic</em>

Saber now felt like they were in somebody&#39;s sights. He could already imagine Bill aiming from a safe distance, counting down until he felt ready to fire.

If you give yourself up now perhaps I will consider not bending your knees the other way!”

Saber sternly yelled for compliance, with a little threat too, as he continued to close in the distance between him and Archer, he can’t let him get away now. Leaving an Archer alone to do Archer things is the last thing he wants to happen, Saber’s going to get him and Saber will finish him off right then and there.

 ”Hit? I haven’t laid a finger on you yet, cowboy. But I’ll make sure, when I do, to break the bones in your face!”

Saber couldn’t help but feel a sense of danger and urgency as Archer’s voice seemingly came closer only to then fade into the darkness of the sewers, must be the acoustics of the place, either way, Archer must be getting away.

From the dust appeared Archer’s ride, doing the same thing as it did quite literally seconds ago. Saber did not think much of it at first though upon seeing the familiar silhouette of Archer, Saber was going to lunge at him and lop his head off his shoulders… if it weren’t for the lack of the distinct aura of a Servant.

Saber cleanly moved himself aside, evading the beast and continuing to chase Archer down, but… where is he, really? He felt warmth in his clothes again, this time coming from the abdomen. No gunshot, no flash, nothing that can tell if a bullet was fired. This is bad, very bad. Not only does Saber have to look for Archer in the dark, he’ll be looking for him while he’s being struck by something he can’t even see or hear.

Turning around, he saw Archer’s steed idling, seemingly stopping their aggression. Of course, the rider was revealed to be nothing but a trick that only the most gullible would fall for. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114820151662092378 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114820151662092378><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 2:37 AM">2:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The Masters appear to be having their big decisive battle, meanwhile Saber is trying his best to come up with an approach to his situation.

 ”Don’t have any last words, but I suggest you say yours as well.”

Saber walked a couple of paces before stopping. He can’t exactly continue his pursuit, he’s not a Servant capable of operating long distances from his Master. Saber does not know how far Archer exactly is but he can’t be too far.

 ”Like I said, Archer. Change it up, I catch on things fast.”

Catch on things fast, hm, Saber? How can Saber find counterplay against something he can’t see or hear coming? No matter how silent it can be at first, a bullet is a bullet and it will interact with the environment it is in. Judging from how Archer used it earlier, it does appear to follow the natural laws of the world to an extent.

If Saber can just concentrate, he will hear the bullet ripping the air. However, it never made such a noise just two instances ago. Did it get faster or something? Was it so fast that the air itself forgot to rip? Ridiculous that he had to think about it. This time, he’ll force it to make something that he can sense. Saber will use the nature of his sword to formulate a wall of air that will allow him to hear the air ripping with more clarity.

Saber readied his blade and gave multiple rapid slashes in front of him. Normally, nothing will happen, it will be just Saber blindly swinging his blade, but now that he has seemingly awakened the nature of the sword, he is unleashing forward moving wind in layers. The effective range is two meters, two meters is all he needs to react to any disturbances. 

 ”Well then, Archer. What can you do now?”

Saber paused to wonder how Archer would respond to this little interaction of theirs. Was it a foolish move? Was he actually right behind him this whole time? Saber thought about the worst, but he knows this interaction will be something worth analyzing later on. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As did Lachlan, shrouded in the protective shadow of his puppet. But the space in front of Pyg burned bright with fire, then it grew and grew, until it formed a towering pillar of flames that engulfed the puppet in its entirety. The pillar surged upwards, piercing through the ceiling and shot into the sky.

Pyg let out a desperate roar. Then the sky fell.

The deafening sound of collapse reverberated through the sewer tunnels. The impact was so tremendous, that even the surface of Berenice island shook, as if an earthquake had swept through the slums. Huge gray chunks of concrete and stone tumbled down, caving into the sewers, while a powerful gust of wind whipped through the cracks. 

The drastic difference in temperature between the tunnels and the surface created a powerful draft, sucking in air from the outside. The influx of oxygen only fueled the fire, causing it to spread far out of control. It began to devour everything in its path, burning up trash while releasing volatile chemicals that caused a chain of smaller explosions that rippled through the tunnels.

Such was the risk of playing with fire. Even if Pyg failed to deliver the killing blow on its enemy, what of the resulting devastation? What of the civilians residing aboveground, who had been unwittingly thrust into a disaster they had never even signed up for?

Lachlan, naturally, could not care less.

Collateral damage was a bygone thought. Incidentally, his thoughts were no longer his own. His intellect entwined with Pyg&#39;s instincts, and he breathed the air that Pyg breathed, felt the extent of the damage to Pyg as if they were one...

<em>rumble....</em>

The fallen heap that was Pyg began to stir. Like viscous sludge, its colossal form shifted and molded itself upright. Leaving globs of tar-like residue in its wake, the creature sniffed the air, and the skin near its nostrils bubbled and charred under the lingering heat.

And of course it was. In a cruel twist of fate, the skin and flesh that Supay had melted acted as the body&#39;s own layer of defense, protecting the puppet&#39;s internal structures from further harm. Gloria would need a considerable amount of time to penetrate the rest of Pyg&#39;s defense.

Just a bit more. Push a little bit more, and she could...

Lachlan went in communication with his puppet. Thirteen minds exchanged their thoughts in a quick council. It concluded in a flash. 

&#39;Burning. Thirsty.&#39; He mused, absentmindedly scratching his own throat. &#39;Water.&#39;

No, not the putrid waters of the sewers. <em>They</em> craved something clean, revitalizing, and substantial. Utilizing his knowledge of Berenice&#39;s layout, Lachlan swiftly charted a path to the nearest shore. A direct path through the bustling downtown district. That would be the quickest way.

With a turn of his head, he caught sight of Bill&#39;s blurring figure amidst the swirling smoke and falling debris. Together, thirteen minds heeded the Archer&#39;s words. 

<em>Yes. To kill...is to make it stop...a prudent choice. Douse themselves, come back, and finish the job.</em>

&#39;We will return,&#39; he nodded. &#39;It will be done!&#39;

He went over to Pyg, who scooped him up with a half-melting arm. Together they leapt out of the hole carved out by Supay&#39;s flame pillar, and bounded away.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115005004164649020 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115005004164649020><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 2:51 PM">2:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was then that it hit her, all the tiredness and pain wash all over her without mercy. 

With all her focus on using Supay to its fullet before the time run out she ignored how the continous strain on her brain was slowly breaking her.  All of this coming at her make her grit her teeth to avoid yelling in pain causing her focus to waver and shorten the time she had left to use the Supay. 

More and more cracks filled the fire giant, they extended over the body, the imposing giant began to look so brittle like it would be easy to smash into pieces and so Gloria prepared herself for the worse as at this point she had no other choice but to the play this to the end. But as she prepared to meet the beast head one once again the beast began to walk away. 

&quot;Uh?&quot; was all she could say as she saw how the beast began to escape. Her shock being so big that she didn&#39;t noticed Lachlan words.  

Once Pyg was gone she wonder her options for a moment before she let out a sigh and the giant began to dissapeared. She could keep it around longer but in that state it was barely a defense and any longer would leave her useless unable to attack nor move once the time ran out. 

She picked her guns and saw the destruction, unsure of what to do next. 

&lt;Saber?&gt; she called with her mind. &lt;The master escaped... how are things on your end?&quot;&gt; 

She wanted to just get away from this place, but she needed to fully asser the situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had met plenty of thick people in his youth, either those too dense to put two and two together or those who valued their pride over their life. Plenty of people looked at his guns and shrugged, thinking that they were at the center of the world, that this lowly outlaw could never rob them of their life savings.

He made sure to humble them, a bullet at a time, which is exactly what he had planned to do with Lancer. <em>&quot;So much for that.&quot;</em> He still thought to himself at times, but now had the golden opportunity to make up for it.

In his eyes, Saber was a <em>fool.</em> Plain and simple. So what if they figured out that Leapfrog was a distraction? Archer was still hidden and all they could muster was whipping up winds at close range. That was the weakness of a Saber: They could never reach the lethality of an Archer, for people like Bill killed at range. One shot. One small opening was all that he needed to finish things off. It could be the head, the neck, the groin, the stomach, the buttocks, the liver-

<em>CRASH!</em>

But it was all pointless. Pointless to the very end, for his Master had once again brought disaster to Bill&#39;s plans. He had trusted him to deal with the fiery bitch, which he admittedly did do a good job at stopping, but he didn&#39;t finish the fight. Instead, Lachlan seemed to be stuck in a trance, sounding more like a junkie on an opium high as him and Pyg coalesced into one being. Archer noticed that empty gaze and immediately attempted to establish contact, only to be met with conflicting thoughts and voices in an echo chamber.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115356105506304071 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115356105506304071><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 5, 2023 2:06 PM">2:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;You FUCKING idi-&gt;</em> He had many choice words to say, but they were all drowned out by Pyg&#39;s instinctual thoughts and Lachlan&#39;s own standoffishness. He watched as his Master abandoned him with Pyg, leaving even Leapfrog behind.

Well, there went Bill&#39;s plan. He could never hope to beat a two on one, since Saber&#39;s Master could inevitably give away his position. And if he didn&#39;t act now, it was quite likely for Gloria to dispose of Leapfrog, which would cut away his only escape route.

He narrowed his eyes, swimming in the shadows as he stared at the end of his gun&#39;s barrel. It was currently pointed towards Saber. He slightly shifted it to the right, so that it now pointed towards Gloria instead.

He sighed as he readied to pull the trigger. One thought crossed his mind in that moment: What good of an outlaw was he if his targets kept getting away scot free?

<em>BANG!</em>

That thought ended as soon as it began, because he already knew why he had failed. One thing he loved about Bill Cook&#39;s gang was that Bill Cook was smart enough to realize that Bill didn&#39;t need any extra baggage. He protected the gang, but didn&#39;t expect to be protected back. They would just get in the way, after all.

<em>BANG!</em>

Two shots fired, both aimed towards Gloria. Bill purposefully made them noisy, so that Saber could notice them with ease. At this point, he knew the extent of Saber&#39;s speed, therefore he knew that at the distance that Gloria was at, the Servant would have no choice but to rush at their Master lest they see two bullets hit her right in the eyes.

&quot;This good enough for ya?&quot; Bill snarled, revealing himself as he lunged for Leapfrog and ran past Saber, keeping a safe distance to avoid getting cut down. &quot;Ya better hope I don&#39;t see you again. <em>Or there&#39;ll be hell to pay.&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115356169603657810 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115356169603657810><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 5, 2023 2:07 PM">2:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He then slapped Leapfrog on the ass and climbed on top of it, extracting the iron pole and tossing it aside as he grabbed hat and coat and galloped away. Unlike a horse, Leapfrog was quite adept at climbing rubble and ruins, scaling the wall with barely any effort while Bill put his clothes on. The two disappeared in the distance, hotly pursuing Lachlan&#39;s trail. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nothing came up, he could not tell if Archer is playing some sort of mind game on him, but in any case, everything seemed to have calmed down.

The sound of the fierce battle between Gloria and the enemy Master has stopped. Archer does not seem to be present with the only thing left of him being his steed behind him. He turned around deciding that perhaps he should neutralize it while he can before he readied his sword to liquidate an asset.

!!!

 Saber could only run, he must catch the bullets while he still can. Breaking into a sprint, he managed to reach it just in time. With the clean swipe of the blade, he sent them away.

For an Archer, he is a rather sneaky one. Though that can be said for many competent sharpshooters. Ugh, he reeks of dung too.

 &quot;I&#39;m going to put you and your pretty boy Master&#39;s head on a stick, craven.&quot;

Saber extended his arm out and emptied an entire magazine in Archer&#39;s direction. It was ultimately futile as his weapon could not harm a Servant to begin with, perhaps Saber is just frustrated. Playing against a hit and run kind of opponent tends to elicit such emotions within people who have to get up close and personal to do anything significant.

Despite his wounds, Saber still stands perfectly fine. However, in the end, it does need to get treated. From the looks of it, both him and Gloria need to get some help from a healer of some kind.

 &quot;Master, let&#39;s get out of this place before you get really sick.&quot;

They are in the sewers, it is urgent that they leave the place otherwise Gloria may get some nasty infections. Saber may not need to worry, but he does not want to find out what happens to him if he leaves it alone. Now, where to go... ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A great power comes with a great cost, and while there were many things in Gloria mind all she wanted was to pass out yet she knew better than just lay down on a filthy sewers despite how appealing that sounded right now. 

It was hard for her to realize what was happening around her now as she just lay on wall waiting for Saber to arrive as she wiped the blood out of her eyes. Seeing the world lose that layed of red was somewhat comforting. She wonder if at one point the red would stop going away, no if anything maybe she should worry if later down the line she may end up losing her sight. 

It was then was she saw Saber coming at her, she was unaware of Bill sneaky attack and even if she werent she was in no state to dodge nor protect herself. Still seeing Saber back was somewhat  reassuring. 

&quot;Good job Saber&quot; was all she could say with a smile as regardless the fight was over. Saber spoke and she had to agree with him, this was no place for wound. 

&quot;Get me to a doctor please&quot; she said with a groan as she let her servant take it out of there. She would need to deal with Saber wounds later as unlike her he seemed in a better shape. 

&quot;Next time we will win Saber&quot; was the last thing she said before leaving the sewers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
