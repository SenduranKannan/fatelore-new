So this is a &#39;kay-bap&#39;? The burger from the other day was nice as well, but this one seems more fit for my tongue!&quot;

Philoctetes continued to drag his Master around for his liberating tour around the city. Grabbing a quick bite here and there, before going around to visit noteworthy landmarks.

&quot;Did you remember to bring a swimsuit? I don&#39;t have one, so you&#39;ll need to buy me something when we get to the beach.&quot;

Mid-day, surrounded by people like this, it would prove difficult for any Master-Servant pair to initiate an attack. They&#39;d be free to play around all they wanted... was the impression he wanted to give off, as he discretely pushed Charlotte off the path and away from people, under the guise of knowing a shortcut to the beach.

They didn&#39;t need to be well-hidden, just sneaky enough. It would be difficult to keep track of someone specific without knowing exactly who you were looking for.

Once they were in a well-isolated location, Philoctetes called out to Charlotte again.

&quot;... All that tomfoolery aside, remember when I told you that we were comrades, but that I&#39;d be doing my own thing?&quot;

&quot;I stand by that, but I feel like I should let you know beforehand, just to make sure you&#39;re sufficiently prepared. Mages have a way of sharing senses, like sight, with familiars like Servants, right?&quot;

&quot;If you look through my eyes right now, you should see our first Master target for the war.&quot;

Immediately after finishing those words, Philoctetes shot out an arrow.

Fast enough to be difficult for your average person to perceive with their naked eye... although it would be a different matter for a Servant. 

It was a surprise attack that made use of the shared assumption that a battle wouldn&#39;t occur in densely populated areas.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>The Saber ended up confessing to his master as they left the restaurant where they had decided to stop to eat. The food had this fried smell that had made it that so much appealing for some reason unknown for him.</em>

<em>The duo had been roaming around the streets of Berenice looking for points of interest and to learn more about the city and it&#39;s culture as well. While not knowledgeable about this land or the story that comes with it, Afonso could tell that there were a few things one could learn while roaming around.</em>

<em>Wait, was that-</em>

<em>Without having too much time to think or act, Saber shoved his master to the ground, falling on top of him, as the arrow went over them before hitting finally hitting an unsuspecting tourist foot. The man cried out in pain, falling to his knees and attracting the attention of those that were on the street, quickly surrounding him to see what was the problem.</em>

<em>Afonso didn&#39;t stay too long on the ground after that, as he grabbed Karl&#39;s hand and helped him get back to his feet, before taking advantage of the now more condensed crowd to bringing him to a nearby alleyway. It was rather small compared to the main streets and didn&#39;t offer that much visibility, but at least that should mean whoever was behind of the attack should be able to target him.</em>

&quot;Are you hurt? I had to act and that felt the better solution at the time.&quot; <em>Had they gone mad and desired to start a fight in the middle of broad daylight? Such a shameless behaviour... An hint of frustration was visible on the servant&#39;s face.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And it was definitely the right choice, the calming and majestic scenery was cut short as Karl felt a heavy weight fall over him. He was uncertain of what to do.</em>

<em>Landing on the pavement he scratched his elbow, blood dripping, but he had no time left to think. Afonso had already acted for him it seemed, as from the screams something bad had happened. Did bad lack follow them even in this wonderful and mesmerising day? His heart starting beating faster as Afonso pulled him through the bust and crowded streets and into a alleyway. It was there that for the first time, he could freely take a deep breath. The question of whether he was hurt or not did not need an answer as the blood had spilled all over his shirt with him not even noticing. But the scratch seemed to have stopped bleeding for now. He did not know what to do or think about the situation. It was broad daylight, any sane person would not attack in the middle of a busy street. It was certain that whoever had targeted them was not afraid of causing chaos and pain to the innocent. This made Karl&#39;s blood boil with anger, it had been a long time since something like this had happened.</em>

<em>He never felt resent or even hatred towards others, but this was on a whole other level, hurting people not involved in a war be it indirectly or directly could not be left unpunished. He clenched his fists and bit into his lower lip, his eyes shining a darker colour as if something had for the first time awakened in him, he was experiencing new emotions and like a toddle didn&#39;t know what to do of them</em>

The sights in Berenice were truly spectacular and the food all be it a lot of it junk food had its own unique character to it. 

&quot;a swimsuit? No I didn&#39;t bring one but I dont mind purchasing you one when we get there&quot; 

Being dragged off to the side was a little confusing to Charlotte, surely there wasn&#39;t anything to hide from at a time like this - Ah Philoctetes had decided to go a bit off script. He&#39;d spotted a master in the busy crowds of shoppers. 

&quot;yes I see him I take it we will be fo-- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?&quot; She thought he&#39;d lost his mind attacking a master, in broad day light, and in a busy crowd!? He must have gone insane what if he hit a civillian?? &quot;You can&#39;t just attack people whenever archer you have to be far more careful!!&quot; 

She was particularly annoyed by his brashness to attack in such circumstances, Despite it technically not being against the rules, There was a rule that kept the secret of the Holy grail war which essentially dictated combat to occur at night. She was not annoyed by the fact that Philoctetes had started an engagement of his own will but the manner in which he did it. 

&quot;Personally I&#39;d consider that a incredibly out of line archer - do you at least have a location in mind for our next steps? There is no way we can fight here as im sure you&#39;re aware.&quot; 

She doubted Philoctetes would want to just launch an attack and then leave - and on top of that there was no way the master and servant he&#39;d attack would let such a bold move go unanswered especially since he hit a civilian with his strike. She wanted to make sure the civilian was okay however that simply wouldn&#39;t have been a possibility.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That was unexpected... he decided to hide from Charlotte the fact that a civilian <em>was</em>,  present tense, screaming on the ground in pain right now. 

It was a smart maneuver, using the crowd as a distraction to bring themselves into a safe location. Philoctetes couldn&#39;t fault it at all strategically. Although, they were the ones who decided to not block, so the blood wasn&#39;t on his hands! Or so he unfairly reasoned. 

&quot;Relax, even I&#39;m not crazy enough to start shooting into a crowd of people. I just wanted to lure them towards where we were, but they managed to get away from my sight.&quot;

... He, once again, decided to hide <em>how</em> they got away from his sight. 

&quot;Although, from the glimpse of their expression I saw, they were pretty mad. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come over here nonetheless.&quot;

The Archer wondered if there was anything more he could do to goad the pair over, but with the two out of sight, he decided to stay still for now. The direction his arrow came from would have been more than enough of a hint to their location. It <em>would</em> be smart to change locations, but...

<em>His eyes shined an unusual colour as he felt the anger inside of him boil. The dim lit and narrow alleyways of the city of Berenice were hard to move easily through. But, he was certain he could cover the distance between them in a matter of moments. It all relied whether or not he was willing to his his Magecraft. His mind running loose, new emotions, strategising, taking care of Saber. It was at this moment, that his unconsciousness, this great mystery of the human mind which lurks with us like a shadow that follows us every step of the way, acted and Karl for the first time used his mental link with his Servant to communicate.

“I have a plan. Let us cut both of them from each side, I can increase my speed to arrive in a matter of second. I hope you can do something similar to Saber.”

*The cold pronunciation of the word would have definitely made Afonso worry about Karl. He had never referred to him by Saber, during this whole journey he exclaimed that he deemed him as an equal. He was carefree and loose, not minding anything. But, it seemed that the previous encounters changed something in him. 
People have the right to have be the judge in the journey of life, deeming the actions of other’s as evil or good according to their beliefs. Gloria and Hallbjorn, it was a matter of a clash between ideals that could have ended in the shed of unnecessary blood. The world was cruel, the numerous murder cases spreading like a plague through out Berenice made his blood boil. He was weak, he could not save no one. Even that poor tourist he could not save, but this time it was different. The culprit lied ahead and he was ready to serve the justice he so longed for.

“It will end with this.”

*From the eyes sight of Archer, the boy was covered by teal sparks as his circuits activated and in a matter of seconds, after jumping in the air, he disappeared. Though a shadow, no a bird, a plane was moving through the red tiled roofs of the buildings</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107021495261216908 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107021495261216908><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 13, 2023 2:08 PM">2:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><ul><li>It was moving at such immense speeds that it caused the delicate roof tails to break and fall onto the terraces or narrow streets of the city.

Taking into account the sheer power and momentum of the kick, it would most definitely send the girl kicking and fracture most of her ribs, that is if Archer did not act quickly.

She had got her guitar out in case thankfully, always pays to be prepared after all although she was not prepared for what came next.

A young boy appeared in front of her, his eyes boiling with such intense rage - it sent a chill up her spine - She knew in that moment she wouldn&#39;t be able to doge whatever attack came flying in, he&#39;d arrived on the scene far too quickly and she couldn&#39;t just start playing now there simply wasn&#39;t the time. It was a kick that toward her abdomen great this would hurt like hell probably fracture a couple ribs - she wasn&#39;t exactly great at physical combat. He swung with such immense aggression it certainly felt like a clear intent to kill her there and then, She wasn&#39;t sure if he a human had that capacity to kill in just one kick mage craft or not however there was nought she could do - She would have to just stand there and hope Archer could either counter or block, all her mage craft was music based and there was no way she&#39;d be able to keep up with such speed.

She could at least try to turn and and tense up perhaps reducing the injury a fair bit she also attempted to step back in order to reduce the contact Karl&#39;s foot would actually gain perhaps reducing the force he&#39;s able to apply. This way she would be able to save the majority of her ribs since it takes a lot of force to fracture them and she would certainly be able to cope with only a few fractures rather than them all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107545018568298498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107545018568298498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 15, 2023 12:48 AM">12:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The strike hits home and in fact catches her at a funny angle the reduced force does still fracture a couple ribs and send her spinning to the floor a few metres away Archer would most likely have been busy with the approaching Saber servant, They were just as bold as Archer great how could they not wait?

Do your best to keep civilian damages to a minimum for me, will you?”

As he continued keeping an eye on the pair, Philoctetes made quite an audacious request. Said in spite of the fact that he had been the one to initiate the battle near such a populated area.

<em>”—Whoa, fast. But…”</em>

Considering his speed, there would likely be little point in trying to warn Charlotte about the incoming attack.

Would be much quicker to just act himself.

“Too bad for you, you’re not even a tenth as swift as Achilles was.”

The most straightforward answer Philoctetes could come up with was to shoot an arrow towards the Master directly, and so he did. No need to overcommit himself to an attack here. If the arrow landed, it should be more than enough to take out Karl, and even if it didn’t, he trusted Charlotte to be able to take care of herself.

… More importantly was the incoming Servant. <em>That</em> was who Philoctetes was meant to devote most of his resources to.

In proximity of Philoctetes, five robotic satellites dyed in a purple hue manifested, before they began to position themselves outwards. Quite early, he manifested his Noble Phantasm.

His left eye began glowing yellow— transferring his vision from his eye to one of the satellites. Pointed towards himself, of course, as though observing himself from a third person’s perspective. The demerit to this would be that his Clairvoyance would be sealed in this state, but on the flipside, in the case the Servant was attacking him from behind, it would be easy to discern.

He had no intention of re-activating his Clairvoyance. The Servant approaching close was a bygone conclusion, and he wasn’t one to just shoot his enemies from afar.

<em>”In the middle of waiting for my guest, girlie.”</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>
