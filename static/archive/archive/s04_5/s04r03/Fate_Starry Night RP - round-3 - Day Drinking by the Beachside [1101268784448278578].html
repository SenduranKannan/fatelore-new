Marcus was still licking his wounds from a couple of nights ago. He had mended what he could, the rest would be a matter of time. The necromancer was thankful that no major organs were injured in the bout between himself and the puppet master. Yet he couldn’t rally quite like his younger self could. 

An ever present ache was felt through his body. One which was mildly soothed by the drink in his hand. The coroner was a little displeased that he was unable to bury the Dowling heir in that cemetery. Yet there will be ample opportunity to show him his place in the future. What pressed on his mind more was the anatomy of those things which stood at the boy’s side. Something which he could only lazily scribble on a piece of cheap bar napkin. 

What made matters worse was that his face was now known. Brazenly showing himself in the public was not a good idea anymore. Hence his current location for a drink. Tucked neatly away in the corner. Hopefully unsuspecting enough to go unnoticed by the barkeep and the occasional wanderer into the establishment. 

“Lancer.” The Master spoke between their shared mental bond. Jotting down what notes he could in between sips of the sickeningly sweet beverage in hand. “How would you describe those things?” He posed the question. Unsure of exactly where his servant was stationed at this time. Perhaps on the beachfront itself, or perhaps he was seated right alongside the man. Either way, he wished to pick his servant’s brain for a few moments. 

A curiosity was present in Marcus’s mind. One seldom seen. It only seemed to peak through upon first meeting Christopher, but since the newness and unfamiliarity of having a servant has worn off, something else piqued it’s interest. Quite possibly it has been years since things of this sort excited the coroner this consistently. As the drunken scribbles of the man continued to mark the napkin.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 6:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101382765804527658 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101382765804527658><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 28, 2023 12:41 AM">12:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Abominations. Blights upon the earth. Do I need to go on?</em> 

The spectral growl from Lancer responded almost instantaneously, as if the wolf himself was hunched over the worn and spotted bar counter. He was, of course, not present. Even with his cloak to shroud his figure, the fact that their faces were plastered all over the news did little to give the Saint any true freedom to materialize. Indeed, even in the haze of the cigarette smog, the dull blue glow of the overhead television managed to bleed through the artists rendition of Lancer&#39;s form, now made to resemble some Grimm fairy tale that was currently stalking the streets for human flesh. He actually felt a pang of relief that no one recognized him; what would it do to see Saint Christopher allied with the legion of the undead? 

<em>Wouldn&#39;t it be a lot safer if we hid for now? I knew that Archer&#39;s Master would be a thorn in our side, but this is a low blow, even for them. How are you going to secure supplies for your magecraft? Have you even taken a second to consider that? Do you even care your face is plastered all over like some kind of boogeyman? What&#39;s your plan, Master?</em> 

That last question was spat from between Lancer’s teeth, almost coming across petulant as the spiritual fatigue and annoyance seeped into the fog. This turn of events was problematic, of course, so maybe he couldn&#39;t be blamed. But he almost seemed to be challenging Marcus, and voicing a latent feeling of regret that could prove problematic if it wasn&#39;t quelled right here and now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101743198008774697 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101743198008774697><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 12:34 AM">12:34 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Finishing his first of potentially many studies into the anatomy of the leapfrog. “You see there’s a respect yet also blatant perversion of anatomy in those things. The most sacred of things twisted and tormented.” The coroner mused, taking yet another sip from the slightly too sweet cocktail.

An old fashioned. A favorite of his and Stephen’s. Especially after particularly rough shifts. A slight smile would be seen on the edge of his mouth, the novelty of these creatures would’ve astounded his old love. Even hearing the tale of how Marcus fended off Lachlan would’ve gripped the other man’s attention with fervor. 

Yet he was not him. Looking over the bar napkin with lazy scribbling upon it soured his smile. The novelty of the thing which laid before him wore thin. It was a reality that he would have to contend with again. Not some monster from a B rated horror film he could discuss for hours. Reality calling even harder as lancer drew his attention to the television.

Renditions of both master and servant were plastered across the screen. Followed by The Saint grilling into the necromancer. “You bring up excellent points, lancer. However, My craft isn’t that limited. Being a boogeyman also fits nicely.” The man took another sip from his drink, the glass nearing half empty as he does so. “We talk with the nun and the child, see if they can offer a coverup. Or at least whoever else is working with the nun. And we find allies.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101909963703603341 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101909963703603341><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 11:36 AM">11:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She leaned over to Marcus, two seats away from her, and responded without prompting.  &quot;I can tell you, the only thing you&#39;ll find with that child is a reason to remain a childless spinster.&quot;

&quot;Hello!&quot;  She leaned back once it was clear that she was talking to them and not some other patron in this dive.  &quot;A fine day for drinking...it always is when you&#39;re old, isn&#39;t it?

Were it any prospective partner of Marcus, that&#39;d be enough to throw them for a loop - and given this woman looked like a foreigner, Marcus wasn&#39;t in danger of anything worse than a strange glance and perhaps a backhanded comment!  Maybe.  Probably.

There was only one issue.  She lifted her brows in that sort of polite and light concern that comes from trying to understand the unintelligible, and replied &quot;What does your happiness matter in this situation?  Can&#39;t talk to a woman because you&#39;re gay?  So just seeing a woman ruins your peace and joy...&quot;

She held up the back of her hand to her mouth and laughed.  &quot;Oh, oh, I must understand why: can&#39;t spell <em>happiness</em> without <em>penis,</em> no?&quot;  She pointed a finger and a second finger, and engaged in a simulated sparring match between two swordsmen, or whatever it might be.  &quot;What a fine term, &#39;gay&#39;!  Can&#39;t just call them sodomites like in the old days, no, you have a poker in your chimney and you must let the world know you&#39;re joyous for it.  I&#39;d question your choice of hunting ground, but who am I to complain?&quot;

What a huge bitch, this random stranger.  She walks in, makes a weird pick-up line, starts being homophobic and laughs at her own jokes.  There must be something within the human soul that enables Man to act especially rude while on vacation.  Of course, it couldn&#39;t be any more appropriate that she would ruin this conversation by dragging everything back towards seriousness.

&quot;Ah well, maybe you&#39;re just burdened with a woman for a Servant instead of a proper man.  A shame, the men of the Throne are almost all quite handsome in their own right.  No mana transfers for you.&quot;

<s>At about this time, without any prompting whatsoever from James&#39; point of view, Triboulet sent a mental note to her Master: <em>I&#39;ve broken our promise.  I am afraid I had to make another joke about the gays.  Feel free to punt me, but &#39;twas for our own good.</em></s></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only for her to say something rather pertinent. It didn’t shock the coroner, but did draw his attention back towards Triboulet. Whoever this person was, they were involved in the war. Great.

While Marcus’s facial expressions didn’t betray his feelings. His sudden turning back towards assassin most certainly did.

Which meant they were somewhat safe in such a public space, or at least she was more than Marcus. 

<em>I thought it was odd she mentioned a child. She <strong>was</strong> talking about Ruler. She must have met him...or knows him. Master, she might be one of those Executioners you&#39;ve told me about, which would make turning your back on her dangerous.</em>

A hush fell on Marcus&#39; back. He was only there in spirit, but the grit of Lancer&#39;s voice almost made it feel like the massive Servant was breathing against Marcus&#39; neck and his frame was completely at his back, staring intently at the woman. 

<em>You already proved yourself against that little snot nose in the graveyard, so I won&#39;t judge too intently. Lead us somewhere private. The moment she makes a move, I&#39;ll take care of her.</em> 

Marcus could almost feel the growl in the back of his Servant&#39;s throat.

She rested her chin on both of her fists and looked at him with renewed interest.  She opened her mouth to speak.

And then she had a cocktail dumped onto her.

She took it completely in stride, no stranger at all to old men throwing their drinks at her in outrage, releasing one hand to wave at her face.  &quot;Clearly, I am <em>quite</em> perverse if we&#39;ve just met and you&#39;ve already gotten me wet.&quot;  Unfortunately, she lost her train of thought from moments prior, and with it, perhaps the world&#39;s best joke for all we know.

Assassin gave a half-assed attempt at cleaning herself up with a couple of napkins laid on the bar, not nearly enough to actually get her dry.  As she did, she rebutted &quot;Did thy sensibilities wilt in the face of my truth?  Servants are better yet called slaves, for the servants of a household are afforded quarters and meals, clothes, the slightest semblance of dignity but not respect.  What&#39;s the bare minimum you can give your Servant?  Nothing at all.  They&#39;re supposed to die for you, so why even bother with the ceremony of treating them as you would a paid serf?&quot;

&quot;I think I know the relation between Master and Servant all too well.&quot;  She holds her arms out in a shrug.  &quot;Must I educate yet another person on how it works?&quot;

Now it was time.  Assassin silently spoke to her Master: <em>It is, indeed, the man speaking to me.  Quite the rude bastard, but as I&#39;ve said, all of you Masters seem to be a bit insane.  Come as you please, but be wary, for the Servant has yet to appear.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wasn’t letting up. If anything she was pressing further into the necromancer. 

“No, that was more of a sign that you were getting too close. Most broads take such an action as extreme offense, after all. Or maybe my age is really causing me to lose my grip.” The man simply set his now empty glass back onto the table. The Cherry and orange peel remaining alone together in the confines of the drink. 

His hand then went for his wallet. Producing a handful of bills, then setting them upon the table. More than enough to pay off his current tab. “If you want to speak so brazenly about relations of that sort, perhaps we should be more private.” Marcus moved his head around the bar. “It’s dead but not quite silent enough for this <em>discussion</em>.” A slight glint of gold could be seen from his hand as he stood up. 

“I would say ladies first, but I doubt you have such grace to be referred that way.” His body ached even more as he moved away from the comfortable and dark corner. It was to be expected. The grail war was now in full swing. There wouldn’t be ample time to rest, if anything this became a marathon full of sprints.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1102723841584807986 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1102723841584807986><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 1, 2023 5:30 PM">5:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Though I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find much privacy.  You&#39;re so decrepit that even God himself would find it difficult to not spy upon ye, looking down from His throne while biting upon His nails in fear that he, too, may become as infirm as you are in age beyond age.&quot;

She resisted the urge to laugh, for once.  What fun, though!  An old man who was just right and truly rude.  James could take a few pointers from this one; keep the social grace but learn how to lash people with your tongue as viciously as this sod does.  Maybe get better taste in drinks as well.

To his further invite, she shook her head.  With a long theatrical spin of her hand, she held it out toward the back door and bowed deeply to him.  &quot;No, no.  If I cannot be a lady, we shall use this fall-back: Age before Beauty.

The pain he felt was something that would <em>never</em> leave him. The &#39;truth&#39; he beheld was seared into his memories. Vague hints, objects, and what seems like short frame-by-frame sections of events playing out were suppose to be what he needed to use to find their next targets. In a foreign place, against others he knew nothing about, the &#39;clues&#39; were as helpful as one would think; utterly useless.

So, as fate would have it, a boon would fall upon their lap once news of a conflict that sounded as fake as news could be surfaced.

Zombies and a wolf monster.

Now some of the hints made sense, as surprising as that was.

With the location of where they would be able to find them being hidden within more vague clues, they still needed to find out where this culprit was. Thankfully, James had Assassin who could comb through the possible locations ahead of him. After a few duds, their target was found.

&quot;<em>Good. Make sure he doesn&#39;t leave.</em>&quot;

With his orders relayed back, he made his way. Unfortunately for James, this allowed Assassin to continue to run her mouth, which he feared, given how it could never close.

Once he entered the bar, they would have been difficult to spot, if it wasn&#39;t for Assassin&#39;s outrageous get-up. Who would have thought it would actually come in handy. There he saw Assassin already jabbing at the Master they were looking for. A strained sigh left the already tired man as he walked towards them.

<em>thud</em>

&quot;That&#39;s enough, Assassin.&quot; A fist landed on top of Assassin&#39;s head while she took her bow. Not hard enough to actually hurt but obviously enough to try and reel Assassin back for both of their sake. There he was able to get a proper look at Marcus. As Assassin stated before, everything lined up. This was the man.

That golden glint in his hand soon turning out to be a lighter. “You think I’m that feeble.” He rolls his eyes producing a cigarette from his other pocket, before being interrupted by another presence. 

A man. Handsomely rugged for certain. Blocking the path the Necromancer was attempting to make, and confirming the girl was not a master but rather a servant of the Assassin Class. “Threes company.” The man loosely set the cigarette upon his lips. 

“So you got stuck with her? Huh?” The coroner was thankful that at worst his relationship towards Christopher was antagonistic, and at best it was mutually beneficial. “But yes. A brat decided to make me a public enemy. I’ll take you up on that offer, if you buy me another drink after we’re finished here.” 

There was a high likelihood for another fight. This time significantly more disadvantaged. No nearly limitless horde of the undead. Yet this wasn’t the Dowling heir, it was another magus certainly, but they didn’t have the same monstrosities as that brat. So he stirred to wake what few of his zombies he could manage without going noticed to rise from their hiding spots in the nearby alleyways. “This will be a friendly chat, I presume.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103073199568212099 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103073199568212099><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 2, 2023 4:39 PM">4:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So, the bug was an Assassin? Well, it at the very least cleared a few things up, though he wasn&#39;t quite sure what the plan was on their end. They didn&#39;t even know what kind of Servant Christopher was, let alone did they even see him. Did they have a secret up their sleeve? 

...

No, she couldn&#39;t be anything other than useless. The Master had the same air as Marcus, and the Saint had to sigh inwardly at the prospect. If nothing else, they seemed somewhat reasonable. Perhaps a bit more lively, though Marcus couldn&#39;t be blamed too harshly. He DID work with corpses after all. 

Part of him wanted to believe this was just a chance to talk, but the recent news would only make this a shaky proposition. Even if they were telling the truth, he did NOT want to talk to Assassin longer than he had to. 

<em>Already calling on the dead? Isn&#39;t that risky in public like this? Don&#39;t be stupid. Let&#39;s at least get to where we have an advantage. If they just want to talk, you&#39;re wasting mana for no reason. If they do wish to make a move, I can take that Assassin in one blow easily. There&#39;ll be plenty of fights to take part in, likely more with the Dowling boy and the Archer.

It wasn&#39;t a simple pratfall either, she put a lot of effort into making herself look like she was well and truly dead for a moment with how viciously she thumped into the tile and ragdolled.  This &#39;James&#39; fellow, whoever he is, must be incredibly strong if he can make a Servant expire with but a single blow!

Sparing them any &#39;oh, the humanities&#39; or laments over a brief and fitful life, she recovered from her pile on the floor shortly after.  &quot;Oh, please, Master - I had the man on the ropes, wondering about me all that time.  Couldn&#39;t you have let him think of me as a Master?  I&#39;m sure you&#39;d fit in as a good Heroic Spirit yourself.  Maybe a Hannibal, or a Phillip II...I&#39;d say Bluebeard too, but yours is decidedly not blue.&quot;

Once more Marcus belittled her, and this time, with a more knowledgeable audience, she struck back with mock indignation.  &quot;&#39;Stuck with her?&#39;  T&#39;would be a lie to say I&#39;m not the one carrying this duo.&quot;  She stood up in one fluid motion, adjusting her baseball cap back into place as she walked out after them.  &quot;Were it not for me, we wouldn&#39;t have experienced near-death nearly as often.&quot;

With them out in an alley now, out of the perception of normal folk, Triboulet&#39;s empty hand was quickly filled with a knife.  She made no effort to menace with it, only holding it as an acknowledgement of the tension in the air.  &quot;Just a talk between friends, yes.  I think we&#39;re here to meet a local celebrity, truly.  You and your game of the corpses you love, you&#39;ve become quite the sensation!  It&#39;s a wonder we&#39;re the first to get to you.

&quot;As friendly as you make it, of course.&quot; Even though he made attempts to reel Assassin back previously, James made no such moves when she brandished her knife. This was still a Master after all. His Servant could be anywhere, potentially another Assassin, if they were unlucky, given the strange nature of this Grail War. 

When they reached the alleyway, James pulled out a simple cigarette opposed to a weapon, lighting the end with the tips of his index and middle fingers, thanks to Magecraft. His shades kept his eyes hidden but his gaze remained on Marcus, cautiously watching just in case a move was made.

The moment they stepped in the shadows, Marcus was backed by a wall of darkness which seemed to completely swallow the alleyway behind him. The street lights disappeared from view along with the rustic brick work, leaving the gleam from his own cigarette as the only source of light. The smoke coiled slowly in the air, rising steadily through empty space, barely perceptible to the eye. But it stopped to wreath around a snout, bristled and wrinkled in quiet concentration before passing by the only other source of light in that darkness: a pair of pale blue eyes, taking in James and Assassin at once. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to rip that Archer to pieces the next time I see them.

He followed Jame’s suit once reaching the alleyway his golden lighter being brought to the tip of his cigarette. Before a hand trick and it was now a flask. As if on cue lancer became a looming shadow over the deathly form of the necromancer. 

Yet the coroner’s eyes never left James. “Lancer and I have a particular bone to pick with those two.” A small drag was taken from his own cigarette. “I’m glad this can be a friendly discussion then.” 

Just from that small demonstration of the opposing master’s magecraft. It was clear he was rather proficient with the element of fire. Perhaps even strictly a pyromancer. A promising ally, if things don’t turn sour between them both.

“The Dowlings have a particular magecraft.” Marcus produces his scribbled upon bar napkin. Showing some facsimile of the human form, but bent and twisted into monstrous shapes. “My personal studies with one of the puppets.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104152885052321802 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104152885052321802><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 5, 2023 4:09 PM">4:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A saint should protect the innocent, not simply throw their anger around...that was a Mantra he had to have on repeat in his mind. There was something just so effortlessly antagonizing, so...<em>annoying</em> about her.

I&#39;m personally sorry that you had to be contracted with this Assassin, and that you ever had to open your mouth, because both of these aspects are destined to end with failure and bitter tears.  Your demands were denied, your existence ignored, and your well-being was put in danger.  All of the world&#39;s a stage, and Assassin apparently has a script to adhere to.

She put one wrist under her chin and cupped her cheek with her palm as she recoiled in a very girlish way.  &quot;Eheheee, shut the hell up?  I&#39;m not the one barking here, <em>bon chien!</em>  You keep up this racket and soon, our neighbors will come and start throwing their boots at you.  Besides,&quot; she holds out the hand, &quot;don&#39;t worry.  I have ideas about how to best kill myself all the time, just the same.  We are <em>so</em> alike!&quot;

This annoying thing must have been quite happy with herself, as she wraps her arms around her waist and twists so she&#39;s looking at him upside down, arching her back low and over to see Lancer from her unnatural position.  &quot;Do you really listen to everything your Master tells you to do?  The tone and cadence of your whimpering suggested a man, but the words themselves suggest I&#39;m speaking to a bitch.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then lancer fell for assassin’s taunts. Taking the woman and threatening to crush her neck within his hands. She had it coming, for certain.

He knew Assassin could take much more and keep walking away with zero cares in the world. Their fight with Berserker showed him that much. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Assassin, but you forced my hand here.&quot; He <em>needed</em> this deal. They both did if they wanted to figure out Ruler&#39;s clues. So, this needed to be done. 

James brought up his hand, showing off his Command Seals, and released an annoyed sigh from being forced to do this. &quot;<em><strong>Asssassin, please keep your mouth shut about Lancer for the remainder of this encounter.</strong></em>&quot; With those words spoken, the right wing of his symbol shone brightly before being reduced to nothing but a faded smudge of the initial outline.

A flash of red light stole his attention, and his strength. Assassin hung limply in his grip as he watched both Masters gaze at him. Both a little afraid, both a bit impatient. But both seemed to have one thing in common: confusion. A befuddled and drawn brow at the <em>antics</em> of their two vehicles. 

A barrier between them, as if it was an obstacle they both had to face to discuss true business. 

He let the clown go, and his eyes flitted between both Masters, his eyes staring through both before turning to the rooftops above. 

&quot;Discuss what you need, I&#39;ll be above. Tell me when you&#39;re done.&quot; 

His cloak flitted about his shoulders as he jumped, hands digging into the stone on both sides before launching himself over the edge of the roof, hunkering down while keeping an ear to the meeting below.

Firstly, even if he used a command seal against her, James had to make sure his Servant was fine. The dragon encounter showed him that she wasn&#39;t invincible as he previously thought. So, some care is to be had. Mainly just to ensure that his tool works well. Yes. That&#39;s what he told himself.

No, instead, she looked to James.  Immediately baffled, offended even, she barely managed to mutter &quot;M-Master, you <em>can&#39;t be serious...!&quot;</em>

The deed was done, though.  Instantly, with a geas powerful enough to make saints and heroes bend their knees and give up their pride, a greater ordeal than all of them had been fulfilled: Triboulet&#39;s jaw shut tight and wouldn&#39;t open for some time.  Once released from Lancer&#39;s grasp, she stared up at him - her brows furrowed and her smile replaced with a deep frown, she wasn&#39;t at all happy, or facetious.  She looked like she was a few seconds away from stabbing him.

That&#39;s kind of what&#39;s supposed to happen between two Servants, you know, so it&#39;s ultimately a welcome improvement.

She let him pass upward and away from this dingy alley and its pointless conversation, turning her clear and obvious ire to James.  She didn&#39;t say anything to him, not yet, but made her disapproval clear.  Before he could resume his negotiations, it seemed like Assassin demanded that he look into her disappointed, smoldering gaze and know how much he had fucked up by her count.

Once he did, if only just for a moment, he&#39;d be free of her for a moment as she crouched down by the alley&#39;s gutter, becoming small and grumbling loudly to herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The command seal. Such a waste of a valuable asset. Having to silence the fool and allow these talks to proceed in a significantly more civil manner. 

It was a relief that The coroner was paired with an equally stoic figure in Lancer. Rather than the clown which James had the misfortune to summon. Each servant came with some downsides however, as the Saint could easily deem him ‘not strong enough’ at any point in time. So he just had to keep faking strength. 

“It sounds fair, but there is bound to be a catch with a deal like that.” The man leaned back into the alleyway, no longer having the wall of muscle which was his servant stationed behind. “What’s to say you don’t betray us? Sell us out to another pair?” He took another drag and another sip from the flask. Motioning with it as if he were offering it to the other man. “I know you pulled that trick with her, but what’s to say you aren’t just bait for a bigger fish.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107172969974865960 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107172969974865960><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 14, 2023 12:10 AM">12:10 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
