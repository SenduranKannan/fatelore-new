They gave off no Mana after all, how could they be alive?

Seconds passed, which slowly turned into minutes, as the only movements and sounds that could be heard around the desolate battlefield were pieces of crumbling rock and broken concrete falling to the ground, phantom images of a once violent battle between two Servants…

Then suddenly, a large slab of concrete in the middle of the rubble began to shake, as if something beneath it was pounding against it. It shifted little by little with each thud, until finally it toppled over and collapsed to the ground, breaking into a hundred brittle shards. Dust erupted once more where the rock once was, and a red-haired head emerged from the dust.

&quot;Koff… koff koff!&quot; Ann went into a coughing fit as the dust attacked her. She waved her arms in front of her, dispersing the grey cloud.

By an incredible stroke of luck, she managed to emerge from the wreckage largely unscathed. Her skin was blemished and scraped where it wasn&#39;t protected by clothing due to the friction against rock and concrete, but otherwise she was fine. No broken limbs, no punctured organs. What were the odds?

And yet she could still feel the connection between them. He had to be alive, but where?

&quot;Lind... koff koff... Lindy!&quot; Ann cried, her hoarse voice echoing across the empty battlefield. &quot;Where the hell... kof... where are you, Lindy!!&quot; 

No answer. She cursed, then grabbed at the walls of rubble around her and steadied herself on her two legs... but as she got to her feet, she felt something mushy and soft under her boots.

&quot;The hell...?&quot; She curiously looked down at her feet, but the hole she was in was too dark to make anything out. She brought her foot up and stepped on whatever was underneath her a few times, feeling the same mushy and fleshy resistance against her boot each time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Foggy. Uncertain. Like sleeping one too many hours on a holiday and forgetting what day it was. Eyelids that were shut tight and heavy, weighed down by the fear of glimpsing a world that they were becoming increasingly more aware of, a reality that was dirty and cold. Dry and harsh. Far removed from the comforting apathy of sleep; an absence of thought and concern.
Gradually the mind stirred, rising from its slumber, but as it did, the heart resisted. It longed to fade back into dream.

There was coughing. Someone was coughing?

<em>“...not me”</em>, they confirmed after tightening their throat in an attempt to swallow, but dry as it was, the act ended up accomplishing nothing.

They regretted their sympathetic reflex, as they now became more aware of their body. Their senses sharpened, registering a sluggish aching that afflicted them from head to toe, not unlike the soreness felt after exercising for the first time in months, if not years. It was unpleasant. Annoyingly so. But worst was the crushing weight on their chest which kept them from breathing properly. It couldn’t have been a rock, warm and erratic as it was, and come to think of it, did the earlier coughing not come from directly above them as well?

As if on cue, the coughing resumed, this time accompanied by a name. Lindy. Whoever that could have been, they had no way of knowing, and even if-

They yelped in pain as the person that had made themselves comfortable on their <s>now no longer asleep</s>body attempted to stand, which only served to dig the sharp heel of their boots into their ribs and cause them to involuntarily curl into a ball, as if in a fruitless effort to protect themselves. Whether intentional or not, this dispelled the last of their drowsiness, their eyes pried wide open by the sting of their rude awakening, and taking in the world around them for the first time.

No gilded halls greeted their awakening, no fields of green nor sun-streaked thicket.
Only destruction welcomed them, no matter where they looked, the recent collapse of a massive building still fresh as the structure groaned and shuddered from being crushed under its own mass, the broken rubble having only recently come to a rest.

And amidst it all, a survivor.
Her clothes torn, her skin bruised. Eyes burning with determination and life with such vigor that they did not immediately take note of the unusual shade of her wine-red hair. Just who…

“Who are you?”

Their skin was similarly pale and unblemished, soft and pink where it needed to be, not a single callus to be found anywhere. Everything about them was ephemeral and beautiful, as if a princess from a fairy-tale had suddenly awoken in the real world by some inexplicable twist of fate.

Only that it wasn’t, and neither were they a princess.

Something that became increasingly more obvious once the impact of their unexpected appearance settled and it became impossible not to realize that they lacked any form of clothing, not a single shred of fabric preventing Ann from taking a peek at everything that was laid bare.

A fact the drowsy princess… or rather, the drowsy prince had yet come to realize himself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116761643687362641 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116761643687362641><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 11:12 AM">11:12 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="discord_assets/ayashiro_keika_original_drawn_by_waka_shar-91C24.jpg"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/ayashiro_keika_original_drawn_by_waka_shar-91C24.jpg" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: ayashiro_keika_original_drawn_by_waka_shark_waka__sample-a3743c245e3976677502f8f49cea0399.jpg (115.34 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div></div>

Her eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness, and the first thing that stood out from the shadowy figure were two pale, crystal-blue dots in the middle of a girlish, perfectly smooth face.

&quot;What...?&quot; Her body relaxed naturally as she made out those flawless features, as if acknowledging that what she was looking at was completely beyond inflicting pain on others. Those eyes seemed strangely familiar, but no, they couldn&#39;t possibly be...

She stared at them for a long time, too long, as her eyes adjusted and overcame the darkness of the night. Normally, you&#39;d get used to someone&#39;s beauty after staring at them long enough, but that wasn&#39;t the case here. It was hard to put into words, really. They were... the muse that eluded the old masters and the great composers. The purity of daylight&#39;s last hurrah. Beauty in its truest and purest form. Not even the dirt and repulsiveness of their ruined and dusty surroundings could take away from their allure.

Ann&#39;s words struggled to leave her throat for the first ten seconds she stared. In fact, they were almost so perfect and pleasant to look at that she failed to notice that they were completely unclothed until now. Eventually she managed to regain her composure, her gaze breaking away from their feminine form. She steadied herself and patted off the dust that had settled on her clothes, before brushing her unruly crimson hair aside to get a better view of... <em>whoever</em> they were.

&quot;I&#39;m Ann. Who are <em>you</em>, little gi...&quot; Her inquisitive gaze trailed down the prince&#39;s immaculate body, lingering on his intimacy for longer than she needed to, looking somewhat awed by what she saw. &quot;...boy. Little boy.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not a name he was familiar with, but not one entirely foreign to him either. It wasn’t a particularly uncommon name in his land, but there was something else about it. Something warm. Even intimate perhaps?
Regardless, she had answered his question, and thus he was obliged to return the favor.

“I am…”

In an effort to get up from his curled up position on the ground, he had raised himself and brushed off the loose debris that had stuck to his uncombed hair, though in the process noted the woman’s odd gaze. So transfixed was she on his eyes and nose. Neckline and collarbone. His chest. Bellybutton. Waist. Lower and lower he eyes drifted, until coming to a sudden and extended halt, examining his groin with great interest.

It took him several seconds too long to figure out why.

“Ahh!!”

Though it served no purpose, his feet clumsily stumbled backwards with the grace and dexterity of a startled fawn that had barely learned to walk, his ashen skin now flushed with a healthy peach pink from the indignity of his indecent exposure.
He threw his arm to his side, fingers grasping the clouded air, reaching for nothing it seemed, until-

Whether it was or it wasn’t, it was without a doubt magecraft, marking the boy as a participant of this war, as the very next instant a thick blanket large enough to cover two, if not three normal sized beds manifested in the boy’s hands and was quickly draped around him in a haphazard fashion, the remainder softly plopping at his side and obscuring his nakedness like a curtain… although it could be argued that the tasteful censoring of his body only added to the indecency of his appearance.
That being said, at least it was a step in the right direction.

“Y-you! Why did you… why didn’t you…!”

His mind was a turbulent storm of shame and unspoken accusations directed at the only person around to receive them, his lips struggling to give shape to the feelings threatening to burst from his chest, ultimately accomplishing nothing more than incoherent mumbling.

Catching himself as his own mind wandered and made its own assumptions regarding his vague boast, the boy only seemed to keep digging his hole even deeper, but at the very least being able to talk properly returned to him some manner of composure.

No human could ever be so perfect. No human could have such a soothing, pleasant voice. No human...

Could have the grace of a toddler—a drunk toddler—as they haphazardly covered their naked selves with their gangly arms. And with that, their royal and dignified shell had been shattered, and their true self had been laid bare, as naked as their fair body. 

&quot;Oh please, you&#39;re not the first naked guy I&#39;ve seen.&quot; Ann cracked a funny smile as she looked him over, enjoying his embarrassment far more than she cared to admit. &quot;Don&#39;t be such a prude, it&#39;s nothing I haven&#39;t seen before. Besides, you&#39;re the one who showed up naked!&quot;

His pale skin was now bathed in a reddish glow. Such a strong and visceral reaction, such purity and innocence! It was almost funny enough to send Ann into a laughing slash coughing fit... but what they did next made her heart skip a beat.

It all happened in the blink of an eye. Wide-eyed, Ann could only watch in silence as the boy bent light to his every whim and fashioned... no, <em>manifested</em> a large blanket to cover his naked self. If she needed any more proof that the boy was anything but normal, there it was.

And yet, strangely, she still couldn&#39;t see them as anything but harmless. Perhaps the novelty of watching people perform magic had worn off after the many encounters she&#39;d had so far into the war, but the fact remained that her racing heart had suddenly calmed as she listened to his soothing, if slightly urgent, voice. He just felt like... someone she could confide in without worry. How strange.

She crouched down and looked straight into their hidden crotch, raising her head to meet their flushed face with a malicious grin. &quot;Well, I sure hope you&#39;ve still got room to grow elsewhere. That thing between your legs is nothing to sneeze at, mate.&quot;

She stood up and took a few steps back, looking at Prince from head to toe a few times with crossed arms and a strange expression on her face. Funny bits aside, she had a lot of questions about him, the first of which was: 

&quot;Were you spying on me in this building while I was fighting those other guys? Don&#39;t even think of buttering me up, I&#39;m convinced you&#39;re a <em>Master</em> too... although I didn&#39;t see any red tattoos on your body.

He nodded to himself as he spoke, seemingly satisfied by his guesswork, and regaining some of his confidence as a result.

“I was wondering about the manner of your dress, not to mention your hair, but that explains it. If you know of another prince, perhaps you could even be his courtesan, but sure enough, laugh it up. This will be quite the story you can tell at his court to earn his favor. You will still have your weight in gold as a reward for keeping me safe of course, but don’t expect us to ever see each other again once we’re out of this.”

He was getting cocky. Feeling some brittle sense of security after having established the assumed hierarchy between them, oblivious to the true dynamic of their relationship and the thaumaturgical bond that connected them.

“And what does size matter outside of the battlefield anyway! At court all that matters is your strength of mind and character… and it’s not like I would know what even counts for normal or not in the first place. Moving on!”

Why would I spy on you? More importantly, what do you mean with ‘other guys’!? We should hide or get out of here if they are still around, seeing as while I am… oh right, it makes sense for you not to notice.”

The boy quickly examined Anne’s body, now less taken aback by the impact of her initial appearance, and eventually spotted the set of Command Seals present on the back of her hand.

“I’m a…” his words trailed off as he realized that he actually had on idea who his Master would have been in his current incarnation.

While the woman before him definitely was one, the fact that she didn’t recognize him despite being right at his side at the moment of his awakening meant that perhaps she was unrelated. It was possible that the ‘other guys’ she mentioned were even his allies, but either way, pretending to be a mage or Master at this point would only put an unnecessary target on his back, and it wasn’t like he had Command Seals to sell the bluff in the first place. As such, there was one sure way to sell his value and keep himself from getting killed, even by an enemy faction.

He just casually called her a prostitute, then went on to ramble on about some royal crap like everything was normal, all the while wearing the smugest of shit-eating smugs on his pretty boy face. A vein threatened to burst on Ann&#39;s forehead from the inner anger that contrasted with the seemingly calm and collected face she was making. She was at a loss for words. And if he didn&#39;t stop talking in the next ten seconds, he was going to be at a loss for a jaw, she thought as she stepped closer to him...

But just as he had revealed his identity as a Servant, it was as if a switch had been turned in Ann&#39;s head. She was no longer looking at the handsome, misogynistic boy, but at the <em>Servant</em> in front of her. Her ears were immediately filled with music.

Lindwyrm had sounded like a trashy bass guitar, with grain and noise so thick you could barely hear the instrument itself. The notes were like repeated assaults on her mind, beating with the speed, weight and timbre of a musical jackhammer. That sound was exciting. It was violent, it was unapologetic, it was <em>liberating</em>. And it was the perfect soundtrack for that fiery plane crash. Just plain awesome.

The plucking was gentler, almost as if the plectrum was stroking in the direction of the strings rather than cutting across them diagonally. It was a sound she could only describe as gentle, respectful, beautifully silent, stretching endlessly thin... with a hint of sadness and regret. As if the sound didn&#39;t want to be what it could have been, almost as if for some reason it was holding itself back from fear.

And for God knows why, despite being polar opposites, Ann couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the notes from the two songs seemed to be coming from the <em>same</em> instrument.

&quot;You&#39;re not a Master... but a Masterless Servant?&quot; Ann&#39;s eyebrow raised as she looked at Prince a little more with a puzzled expression, for he seemed... so very, very familiar. Not only because of his eyes, but also because of his sound. She spent a long time staring silently into his blue dots, taking in more and more of his sound, as if trying to decide whether she liked it or not, staring so long that it almost became a little uncomfortable.

It&#39;s slow, it&#39;s weak, it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t know what to do with itself, it&#39;s... it&#39;s nothing like Lindy&#39;s.&quot;

From this high vantage point, she scanned the battlefield in search of her Servant with a fierce and determined expression. The novelty of the boy&#39;s beauty was fading, and her focus was returning to what really mattered. She was almost crushed by a building, somehow made it out alive, and her Command Seals were still in one place. Lindwyrm <em>had</em> to be there, and she certainly wasn&#39;t leaving without him. She called to the handsome boy without even looking at him. &quot;Do you see my Servant anywhere? Big dragon, all white, huge spiky tail, breathes ice... <em>awesome</em>? He should be around here somewhere. If you find him, I might not kick your pretty ass for calling me a whore earlier.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 1:26 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shot Ann a puzzled look at her confusing comment, watching as she scaled the nearby rubble to get a better view of her surroundings. That and she called him cute, which he didn’t quite know how to react to, actively suppressing the part deep within his chest that relished her compliment. The part responsible for his girlish appearance and unnatural birth in the first place. A birth from which he emerged not as a human, but as-

“A dragon, you say?” his mood instantly plummeted at the mention of her Servant, pulling the blanket tighter around him as his brows knitted with some manner of displeasure, “Forget it, that thing is gone. It’s never going to come back. If you’re really its Master, can’t you tell?”

With his chin Prince motioned towards a flattering cloak snagged against a sharp piece of rebar, still retaining its out-of-place elegance in contrast to the wasteland around it.

“If it lost them all, then that means it is dead. Gone for good. It’s probably for the best that it stays that way to begin with.”

He spat those words with all the venom he could muster, talking more to himself than to provide Ann with a satisfactory answer. That being said, at least this served to put his nerves at ease for the moment. Considering that Lindwyrm had been soundly defeated by their mystery enemy, that meant that they should consider it well and truly dead, disincentivizing them from sticking around and digging through the rubble. Though the Master yet remained…

“...”

Prince took one long appraising look at her, and decided that her glaring inadequacy is probably what saved her life. Had she been any more capable or imposing, whoever had put an end to Lindwyrm would have still stuck around to finish the job.

“You’re a weird one. Most people would cheer at the death of a dragon, not try and look for them.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her heart skipped a beat: it was definitely Lindwyrm&#39;s!

Climbing down the pile of rubble, she dashed to the elegant cloak, carelessly grabbing it from the protruding metal pole. She examined it carefully, running her fingertips over the smooth texture of the fabric. This confirmed that it was here and had not simply flown away. She breathed a sigh of relief as she walked over to the disgusted boy, raising an eyebrow at the severity of his words.

&quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m his Master that I can tell...&quot; She threw the cloak over her shoulder and showed him the back of her hand, which still had three Command Seals on it. &quot;Look, they&#39;re still intact. That means he&#39;s still alive, unlike your Master.&quot;

&quot;...but wait a second.&quot; She gave the boy a strange look and put a hand on her waist. &quot;How did you even know about the cloak thing?&quot;

Pale blue eyes like pools of icy serenity, reflecting the hues of the sky like fragile crystals. Velvety white locks of unruly hair cascading in every direction, elegant yet somewhat wild. These colours. <em>That sound</em>. She couldn&#39;t ignore them anymore.

&quot;Wait... don&#39;t tell me...&quot;

Her expression grew more troubled by the second as the pieces fell into place in her mind, a profound realisation washing over her like a chilling wave. How could she be so blind? She could tell from the second she saw those eyes, yet she unconsciously pushed the thought away in denial. There was no way her sick dragon could look so pathetic and weak after all. Not <em>her</em> dragon!

&quot;<strong>Lindy!</strong>&quot;

In a moment of explosive panic and disbelief, she lunged forward, grabbed the boy by the shoulders and shook him furiously, demanding attention and submission from the poor Servant.

Too late. The crazy woman had already taken hold of the rose-petalled cloak and thrown it over her shoulder without wasting so much as a single concern about the potential dangers such a careless act could have exposed her to. By some stroke of fortune she had decided against properly wearing it however, and even if she had, it would only really become a problem once she added another anyway.

Breathing a deep sigh of relief, Prince reproachfully glared at her as he complained, “Not like most people? You can say that again. If you know what those cloaks are then you shouldn’t go around touching them like that.”

That being said, his bad mood would soon be interrupted at Ann’s realization of who exactly he was meant to be, or rather, what he had been.

“You are surprisingly perceptive,” he remarked wide-eyed, betraying his low expectations of the Master he had so far internally labeled as a nutcase, “Though you could have taken a little longer to figure that out…”

“Well sorry I’m not a bloodthirsty pervert of a moron who goes around eating people he wants to marry. And so Archer is the one who killed me? Good.”

<em>“Somebody who fights at range probably has no need for extra armor. Not that he would know what those cloaks are for anyway.”</em>

Prince kept the last part to himself after Ann demanded to know how to reverse his transformation process, instructions that he resolved to keep from her then and there.

“Who even wants a dragon you can’t control on the loose? Wait, just how did you manage not to get eaten in the first place?
…just who the hell are you?”

The swear passed easily over his lips, something that came naturally in her presence. Already she was starting to rub off on him.

<em>“This woman…”</em> Prince’s survival instincts kicked in as he appraised the bad-influence-incarnate before him, <em>“she’s bad news.”</em></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 8:52 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;m your Master, you little twerp! Don&#39;t tell me you forgot again!!&quot; She grabbed the boy&#39;s cheeks and squeezed them together with one hand, pulling his face dangerously close to hers until their noses almost touched. Her nose was wrinkled from the frustration and anger that was brewing inside her, and her mouth was set in an unhappy frown. &quot;And sure, dragon-you may have tried to eat me a few times... you ate a bunch of people, actually... but look at you now! You look weak as hell!&quot;

&quot;And besides, <em>I</em> want a dragon on the loose.&quot; She let go of his cheeks and took a step back, crossing her arms in annoyance as she looked away towards the rubble, reminiscing about the last few weeks spent with her Servant. &quot;You may have been hard to control, bloodthirsty, cruel and a dozen other bad things... but you always did what you wanted and I respected you for that. You were strong, wild, <em>free</em>. And that was damn cool...&quot;

She nodded to herself as she thought back to the bold and wild Servant she had once been blessed with, then looked back at what remained of him in Prince... and sighed, her shoulders drooping as a look of disappointment washed over her face. She seriously hoped that, whatever happened to her Servant, could be reversed one way or another.

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe it. Why would a dope-ass dragon turn into a pretty boy when he dies, it doesn&#39;t make any sense... and why are you talking shit about Lindy like he&#39;s some other guy who has no connection to you? You are him, why are you so angry at yourself?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Alright I understand, I didn’t mean it that way anyway. You’re my Master. You’re my Master. See! So let me go!” Prince cried out in futile resistance, his soft cheeks the unfortunate recipient of Ann’s disciplinary measures.

“Wait, did I hear you correctly? You <strong>want</strong> to have a monster that goes around killing people?”

He was baffled at Ann’s direct confirmation of her intent, her clear preference of his monstrous form over the weakling he had become and utter disregard for his brutality and savagery… just because he was cool?

“Although, now that I think about it, you and him would be a perfect fit. No wonder you managed to summon him; he would be the perfect bloody lapdog for someone like you. Before the end of this War I wouldn’t be surprised if you managed to wipe out the entire island.
Of course I’d try to distance myself from a monster like that if I could, and you’re no different.”

Regarding her with suspicion, Prince silently deliberated between the choices he had, his brow furrowing ever deeper as he quickly ran out of options and arrived at the inevitable outcome.

“...but you are still my Master. Without you I will die, and as I am, I doubt any of the other ones would take me in. They are more likely to kill me on the spot, all things considered. It seems like we’re both unhappy with this deal, so let’s just leave it at that.”

Like a distrustful street animal reluctantly following the scent of food for survival, Prince moved closer to Ann, keeping a tight hold on his blanket.

“We should probably get out of here before we continue. I don’t want Archer to find us if he decides to come back for a trophy.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They clearly did not see eye to eye on this matter. Prince showed disgust, repulsion and seething anger at his draconic form. And because Ann accepted and praised it, that disgust and anger seeped into her as well. And as he aptly put it, they were at a crossroads where neither wanted anything to do with the other, but were forced to remain as one because the alternative was even worse. Just their damn luck.

When he was finally done talking, she let out a loud breath, her gaze showing deep frustration as he crawled towards her like a frightened animal, his every action pushing him further and further away from the Servant she once knew.

&quot;Yeah. You&#39;re right.&quot; She uncrossed her arms and turned away from him, walking away without giving so much as a glance back at his blanket-covered form. &quot;Let&#39;s hit the road and continue this somewhere else.
