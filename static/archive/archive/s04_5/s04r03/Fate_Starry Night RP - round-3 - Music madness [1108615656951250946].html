The bars in the area appeared to be serving well with steady trade while the night was young and the salty breeze coming across from the close by port was a welcome smell to Charlotte the young magus&#39; recent encounter having shaken her a little - well why wouldn&#39;t it have? It was her first time in real combat after all and the young French girl was looking forward to some unwinding. 

This would be perfect for her - a nice chilled out area sure there were some people causing a mild ruckus however this could easily be ignored. She searched for a nice spot aside the street settling on one close to what looked like an alcohol stand, something she found quite peculiar.  The thick smell of liquor was a little overpowering here however the view of the ocean in its starry darkness was something she adored. 

She got her stool out - a crooked old wooden thing that had clearly seen years of service - took a seat and began setting up to perform for a while. She had brought her dear inferno strings with her however she would of course be performing with a throwaway guitar for those that cared to listen. It had been a while since she had been able to properly just sit and sing for people and it was quickly becoming something of a luxury in this environment.

She&#39;d stick it safe tonight and just play some somewhat slower music than usual something soft to the spirit. She&#39;d begin strumming away producing a truly kind melody dancing it&#39;s way into the ears of those around her it&#39;s soft nature nearly hypnotic in a sense in the way it calmed those listening. Accompanied by her young voice the music felt like a painting and she seemed to be its Van Gough (a gross overexaggeration of her talent).</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108615829265854494 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108615829265854494><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 11:43 PM">11:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The longer she played the more at home she truly felt flowing with her music and the minimal mana she was using for marginal manipulation of sound the song itself was one she had only written half of and although it was somewhat obvious to see that fact the performance hadn&#39;t suffered perhaps due to it being in her native tongue the peoples of Berenice were simply enjoying the vibes. She loved to sing in French it felt so much more genuine for her and her performances always seemed more enjoyable when she were to do this plus she believed this was a good method for brainstorming how she would like to conclude the song - one she had credited to her beloved mother. This piece was to be the first in an album she would write entirely dedicated to her Mother and Father and of a completely different style to that of Sophie Matel far softer and gentler representing the love she felt for them.


Little did she know that tonight would not be going quite as smoothly as she may have wished it would.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her steps were sluggish and the circles under her eyes contrasted sharply with her pale skin, so dark they could easily be mistaken for brutal make-up. There was a large bandage on her left cheek, and more bandages were haphazardly wrapped around her injuries, thankfully hidden under her clothes. God, she could kill for some painkillers.

The old man had messed her up in more ways than one. Not only did her body still ache from all the injuries she&#39;d suffered, but she couldn&#39;t remember getting a good night&#39;s sleep since he&#39;d brought up her painful memories of the alley… although resting on a remote island didn&#39;t help her relax, nor did sleeping next to a dragon that could gobble her up at any moment.

Ann <em>needed</em> rest. She needed it like a man needed oxygen underwater. And what better place to get some rest and relaxation than downtown Berenice! She strapped on her gig bag, took whatever money she had and set off for her night of relaxation.

As she walked deeper into the city, the fresh saltwater breeze making her red hair flutter endlessly, her ears picked up a curious melody and her eyes caught sight of a crowd forming around someone in the distance. She walked briskly towards the crowd, pushing people out of the way to see a young girl playing and singing on the curb. Her musical reflexes kicked in and she began to rhythmically tap her foot on the ground as she listened to the song.

A good combination. Not exactly Ann&#39;s style, but she had to admit that the girl wasn&#39;t half bad. Watching her play brought back memories in Ann&#39;s mind. Memories of simpler times, when she used to play in the streets for a few pennies and some positive attention from those watching.

She couldn&#39;t remember the last time she&#39;d done a spontaneous street performance, but seeing this girl playing put her in the mood. She pushed the people in front of her aside and walked into the inner circle right next to the playing girl, raising more than one eyebrow from the audience. Ignoring them, she took her dirty red Strat out of her gig bag and plugged it into her travel amp set to low volume.

&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot; The punk asked her, not even waiting for an answer as she started to play some low notes fingerstyle.

*Dun dun dun dun... ♪ *

She made sure not to look at anyone in the crowd, instead concentrating on moving her fingers to keep a steady rhythm. Her music acted as a kind of backing track, blending seamlessly with Charlotte&#39;s own music and vocals, adding an extra layer of depth and unpredictability. Ann found it easy to join in and add something to the performance, which was as much a testament to Ann&#39;s experience as a guitarist as it was to Charlotte&#39;s skill as a lead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only once the low notes of her Strat began mixing with song so seamlessly could she tell Ann was present. 

The way Ann sat down and was instantly  able to match Charlottes song with her own notes was truly impressive to  her, sure Charlotte had had some commercial success in both London and Toulouse with her one album however she certainly didn&#39;t possess the ability to just sit down and play so fluently with an already established flow - one that clearly Ann wasn&#39;t overly keen on simply told by her instrument, Strats aren&#39;t typically used in songs like these after all. 

The song reached its conclusion fading into the chatter and soft ocean breeze fluttering their hair as it died away Charlotte concluded with no music and the last few lyrics quietly went by those listening. The pair&#39;s performance was met with quite the applause despite Ann barging past the small crowd. 

&quot;Hi there may I ask your name? I&#39;m Charlotte&quot; Charlotte&#39;s thick French accent coated the speech further cementing that she was in fact French and not just singing in the language. &quot;Your talent is very noticeable I&#39;m glad you joined in&quot;

Charlotte gazed at the Tall red headed woman sitting across from her, She seemed very intriguing and although at first Charlotte felt the woman had been a tad overbearing barging into her performance it became quite welcome and made the song feel so much more complete to her.  It was a piece Charlotte was quite proud of and she thought it might sound a tad better on a piano instead of with her acoustic guitar.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109020369433669682 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109020369433669682><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 2:31 AM">2:31 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Ann was certainly a character, her injuries were covered by her clothes however she definitely had the aura of somebody that was a little rough around the edges so to speak Charlotte just felt a little uneasy in her presence there was just something that felt a bit weird but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it - her eyes were very pretty though. 

She had a sip of water and after Ann&#39;s responses she decided to play something a little bit more alive - a tune that would pump people up, this song would be in English of course she went with one released this year. A piece that was rather lively with a far more fast paced melody and lyrics than the previous piece - Smash mouths&#39; All star a lovely piece that truly captured the fiery spirit of a rock musician.

She wondered how Ann would join with this one, would she take the same backing track approach she did for the gentle song or would she throw her weight around and join Charlotte in a lead role with this one? a question truly worth pondering the song wouldn&#39;t be captured amazingly by Charlottes acoustic guitar and would more than likely sound better from the strat Ann was packing however the drum sense could certainly be filled by Charlotte tapping her guitar while she played throw in a little mana and nobody would be able to tell any difference. 

Playing with others was what Charlotte enjoyed the most - Music just flowed so much better with others and the somewhat competitive environment helped to explode everybody&#39;s creativity into an amazingly beautiful piece of art. At least that&#39;s how she felt about it all. 

&quot;Let&#39;s have some fun with this one&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As the first song finished and her performance was greeted with applause, Ann continued to warm up her fingers on the guitar with a few chord progressions. They were still quite sore from her last fight, but fortunately she was used to playing with a sore and battered hand. It was the kind of skill you picked up when you were a wandering, brawling musician.

&quot;Huh? What was that?&quot; Ann stopped playing as she struggled to hear over Charlotte&#39;s thick accent, taking a few seconds to come up with an answer. &quot;Oh, you can call me Ann. You&#39;re not bad yourself, girl. You just lack a bit of presence and aura as a singer, but that&#39;s something you&#39;ll improve on as you continue to play in front of people.&quot;

Charlotte gave off good kid vibes. Not that she was necessarily a kid, but it was clear from her speech and body language that she was uncomfortable around Ann, but still wanted to be friendly and continue playing with her. Maybe it was out of respect for her as a musician or because she was very patient. Whatever the reason, she didn&#39;t mind Ann&#39;s intrusion into her song and continued her street performance by moving on to the next song and officially incorporating Ann into her performance.

But if you give an inch, Ann will take a mile.

While Charlotte was still in the middle of the intro to All Stars, using her acoustic guitar to set the happy and upbeat tone of the song, Ann switched the volume on her amp from low to medium-high with a kick of her boot. Channelling her inner Brian May, she flexed her fingers, grinning from ear to ear, and began to play the guitar harder than ever.

Her Stratocaster screamed as its strings were pushed to the limit, the rhythm starting fast from the start, then somehow picking up as the intensity of the riff increased.

At first she was careful not to look anyone in the eye. Not the audience, not Charlotte. It just wasn&#39;t the right mood during the earlier song. But now that she was playing something more her style, a song that grabbed you by the gut and made you want to scream from excitement, she made sure to stare at every single person in the crowd, her eyes quickly darting left and right to encompass everyone in her Mystic Eyes. She then made sure to give Charlotte an extra dose of her Mystic Eyes by locking eyes with her as she blindly played her riff, as if challenging her to keep up.

Soon the crowd began to respond to her riff and her eyes by getting restless, people cheering and whistling over the fast-paced and murderous tones of her guitar. People in the front began to push each other away as they tried to get a glimpse of the two musicians, and more and more people joined the crowd, attracted by both Ann&#39;s riff and the growing commotion at the front.

A minute and a half into her riff, Ann got up from the curb and walked next to Charlotte, shouting over her own music to be heard:

&quot;You&#39;re too soft, Charlotte! If you want to give these Egyptians a taste of good music, don&#39;t bring up pop! Play your heart out, and let&#39;s give them a Sheer Heart Attack!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She believed this could have also been caused by the style she was playing being one she rarely dabbled in. 

As she started to play the first few chords of All stars Ann&#39;s far more aggressive Brighton Rock solo trampled all over Charlotte - something she felt particularly offended by - It was a very well known piece one Charlotte could definitely play, but not on her Acoustic guitar. She didn&#39;t dare get Inferno strings out. An enemy servant could be watching the crowd or performance for signs of a master - perhaps another master was in the crowd too? It was not something she could risk.

Every time Ann looked at Charlotte she felt uneasy, her gaze just seemed off it was very peculiar to Charlotte she hadn&#39;t ever felt so odd just because someone looked at her. She tried her best to ignore it but it was a feeling that never quite left her be. She absolutely could not get Inferno Strings out so she would have to make do with the acoustic one in her hands. Pacing herself against where Ann was in the song she began to play more to keep track of it than anything else. 

Would Ann be singing it or did she want Charlotte to? 

Ann was a fair way into this legendary riff while Charlotte sat there on her stool attempting to not ruin its fast feel with her Acoustic guitar tuned for a different genre. She was out here to relax and although Rock music was the style she preferred to both play and listen to - it wasn&#39;t one she found relaxing so she had not prepped for this. Charlotte would have to use a little bit more mana than one would like if she were to create a similar sound to that of Ann - an amount that would certainly be noticeable to anyone versed in the arts.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109722266876530769 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109722266876530769><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 1:00 AM">1:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It wasn&#39;t something she had considered doing however Ann&#39;s seeming competitiveness and that damn look - what was it with her eyes?

Capturing the attention of everyone in the crowd felt good. To see people pushing and shoving each other because of her eyes and her music felt good. She wasn&#39;t particularly hungry for attention, but it was <em>always</em> entertaining to watch her evoke that deep, visceral feeling in people and strip away their defences to let their wildness run free. And, of course, playing guitar like an absolute boss was also very enjoyable.

And seeing Charlotte, a little annoyed at her initiative but still going along with it and somehow keeping up with the song, made Ann grin. The girl was letting go, which was exactly how Ann had wanted her to react after she had challenged her so intently with her eyes.

But she wasn&#39;t so lost in her riff or her performance that she didn&#39;t notice that something was wrong with Charlotte&#39;s sound. Despite the fact that her guitar was unremarkable, not even connected to an amp, the sound it produced was loud and hard as rock. Ann raised her eyebrows in surprise as Charlotte matched her rhythm <em>and</em> sound, but instead of wondering if this was a trick or how she was able to do it, she decided to grin broadly and pick up the rhythm some more. The music was just too good to spend time thinking about. The two of them finished the riff together before starting the song again from the beginning.

She had never bothered to learn how to sing properly, with a teacher or otherwise, which meant that her range and technical skills were little more than impressive. But what she lacked in technique she more than made up for in character and energy. Her soprano voice danced between frying, almost seductive lows to ear-splitting, near-shrieking highs that stretched dangerously close into yelping territory. She was impossible to ignore and commanded the attention of everyone in the crowd. Despite playing to an audience that was probably far removed from rock and English, Ann still managed to channel her energy and emotions through her raw vocal performance, transcending the barriers of language and culture, and they were all for it as the cheering and thrashing increased in tandem with their general excitement.

And through it all, she kept her eyes on Charlotte. Years of observing people allowed her to pick up subtle clues and understand that Charlotte was less than thrilled when her defences inexplicably dropped. Most people didn&#39;t pick it up as viscerally as Charlotte did, and those who did usually had good reasons for not wanting to be uninhibited. Not to mention that their reactions were often very strange and interesting. This only made Ann more curious about what Charlotte was hiding inside that she didn&#39;t want to let out, which translated into her keeping her eyes on Charlotte with a smug &#39;give me all you&#39;ve got!!&#39; look.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A bit more so than one would expect of their meagre street performance, Charlotte was mildly concerned about her reckless use of mana in such an area to change the sound of her plane old acoustic guitar but it was almost as if something had convinced her it simply didn&#39;t matter. She was keeping up with Ann&#39;s playing as the song blitzed on and the raw enjoyment plastered over her face was a clear sign of it - she had of course stood up now properly jamming with Ann.

Ann&#39;s singing was something that certainly caught Charlotte off guard, for someone so skilled with her instrument the technical ability was a little lacking however she was capable of covering it up with her sheer infectious energy commanding an impressive presence on stage. Charlotte on the other hand, she had learned how to sing professionally as she spent her early music years as her group&#39;s lead singer and was of course a solo artist now she decided not to sing herself for fear their voices may be too different creating an awkward symphony much unlike their beautifully synched instruments. 

Ann&#39;s staring really really started to bug Charlotte at this stage she was certain something was up. She just didn&#39;t understand what exactly - and why Ann&#39;s eyes made her feel so uncomfortable. The only thing she really noticed is peculiar occurrences in her own behaviour, using mana when relaxing? It certainly was weird for her and at this stage she&#39;d been using mana so recklessly that if a servant truly was watching her secret would be out. As she played little green sparks barely noticeable by the human eye were flying of her fingertips as she continued to fine tune the sound she produced channelling mana through it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110634749686456361 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110634749686456361><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 1:25 PM">1:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>If Ann was a magus of any reasonable strength she&#39;d surely notice - thankfully the crowd offered them both protection from any open conflict immediately at least. Perhaps she should contact Archer?

well even if she wasn&#39;t a particularly strong Magus if she possessed mystic eyes then surely her parents would have trained her to be able to notice even faint signs of another magus?

The song boiled on as Charlotte&#39;s care for protecting her identity continuously faded until the urge to hide Inferno Strings was all that remained. Something engraved into her being by her Father&#39;s protective tendencies - She must not resort to that guitar while performing only in combat. The temptation to perform with it was beginning to overwhelm her to such an extent she was repeating the statement &quot;only for combat&quot; over and over in her mind to avoid such an occurrence. She even appeared to be physically straining against it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It felt like any control she had was slipping away every second Ann stared at her with her hazel eyes. If she&#39;d been subtle with her mana use at first, now she couldn&#39;t care less about expanding her precious energy or practicing Magecraft in front of a crowd of commoners. She was going all the way in.

Every little detail that, in another context, she wouldn&#39;t have paid attention to was suddenly at the forefront of her mind. At the first sign of fatigue in her fingers, she felt a slight urge to stop playing and rest. She was constantly reminded of the exhaustion and numbness that seeped into her legs as she stood next to Ann. Speaking of which, Ann&#39;s wild hair was all over the place as she banged her head and sang with fire in her throat, her messy bangs ending up haphazardly covering the front of her face. She looked so dishevelled and wild, like an old-school rock star. It was a wonder how Charlotte could even concentrate on her amazing guitar playing when she could drop everything to rearrange and tidy Ann&#39;s unsatisfactory locks.

More cheers and whistles erupted from the crowd around them as the song unfolded, which was somehow growing larger by the second, and included dozens upon dozens of excited locals and the odd tourist, who first stopped out of curiosity, but then became enthralled by the two girls&#39; out-of-this-world musical performance, unable to tear their eyes away from this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

The amped and mana-filled sounds of their guitars finally faded, the last notes stretching out as the two musicians stopped playing in near perfect unison. As they hung their heads down after a physically taxing performance, the crowd took this as their cue to show their appreciation with thunderous applause, excited whistles and cheers, and the odd flirtatious comment about their looks.

Ann smiled sincerely at the crowd&#39;s applause and raised Charlotte&#39;s hand with her own in the air, not unlike a referee declaring the winner of a boxing match. Her face was dewy with sweat as she brought her other hand to her dishevelled hair and brushed it aside, turning her head to look at Charlotte from the side with a toothy grin.

&quot;That was pretty good!&quot; She shouted at her, trying to be heard over the shouts and clapping. &quot;Where did you get that guitar? I don&#39;t know how it works, but it sounds loud and deep without being hooked up to an amp. Caught me off-guard!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The performance (despite being played on two just two guitars) was stirring up such a euphoric atmosphere amongst their crowd as their hearts and souls were poured into every essence of the music with Ann&#39;s fiery and inspiring lyrical performance topping it all off to create a truly beautiful performance in the eyes of the excited crowd.

For some peculiar reason all the little details of Ann&#39;s messy appearance where what was running through Charlotte&#39;s mind, not the sheer recklessness of the mana usage she was burning through right now. She felt very out of sorts having urges to reorganise Ann&#39;s hair rather than crack down on her misuse of magecraft.  She knew at this stage too much damage had been done to her cover surely if Ann were a magus then she&#39;d absolutely be aware of the magecraft at play here, as the song reached its climax Charlottes mind was scrambling to think up an alibi for the strange way she was able to mimic an electric guitar connected to an amp with just her acoustic one. 

The performance faded out into the night leaving just the cheers and applause of an incredibly satisfied audience, as the pair hung their heads dripping with sweat after such a physically exhausting 5 minutes. Ann&#39;s voice could be heard over the applause sort of interrogating Charlotte about the sound of her music, She&#39;d have to think quickly and attempt to dampen any suspicion.

She shouted back to Ann: &quot;I&#39;m not too sure how it works&quot; .... pausing in between thanks to her heavy breathing. &quot;My father made it for me and it&#39;s like the thing mimics the noise i want to make straight out of my mind&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112748691107889322 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112748691107889322><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 29, 2023 9:26 AM">9:26 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She was hoping by playing dumb to the workings of the guitar (something she had completely made up since it was a bog standard guitar) that Ann if she were a magus would assume the mana came from the guitar and that Charlotte simply was not the eldest child in the mage family and so had been hidden from that world. This way she&#39;d avoid any of Ann&#39;s suspicions and hopefully have ample time to recover the extensive mana she had burnt through creating the correct sound for their song.

She thought she should probably leave while she could in order to avoid unwelcome attention from anybody else and thus attempted to make for an exit through the crowd. &quot;I must leave now sorry Ann, I need to go and see a friend about now&quot; faking a glance at her watch.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
