Illyn had wanted to gather a few materials before this excursion: rope, enough ammo for any gun he projected with IBM, and various medical tools in order to project organs from the hundreds of people Illyn had killed, should anything go awry.

His staff was in the crook of his arm as he directed Kalki from the passenger seat.

“Left. Go straight past the Hamburger King™️. Straight past the Lobster and Celery restaurant. Straight. Right…”

He wasn’t even looking at the map anymore. Illyn had already created a map of Benerice in his mind. One glance and he knew their way.

The radio in Illyn’s car blared on, describing several individuals missing their heads as the work of cults.

“Servants.” Illyn said with the same tone as a parent when their child failed an exam. “Unprofessional. We will kill them next.” Illyn took a bite of Hamburger King™️ as he pointed. “Here. Stop.” He gestured at Kalki to pull over.

Go straight.  Right.

The rider took the car towards what seemed to be motel, it’s exterior rundown and yellowing. This was exactly where a group of filthy murderers would go. It would make sense after all. Kalki sighed and put the car into a step, getting out the car without much need of a reason. 

“Stay behind and don’t die.”

He took a step forward, heading towards the fresh entrance of it all, the door somehow strangely new for how rundown the hotel had looked. Odd. . . He wanted to look towards Illyn for an answer but decided against it. He’d rather not speak more than necessary. It didn’t take much to push the door out of its hinges, trying to do such with little noise however could have been a lot more difficult, but somehow it happened. The scent of mold and decay was as thick as the scent of blood from before, bile rose to the Rider’s throat that he had to swallow for a moment. This place was disgusting. . .

Kalki’s rude entrance into the building would immediately draw the attention of a handful of children - some accompanied, some not - and an elderly couple, who chose to simply stare at the strange man. 

On first glance, the one similarly between a majority of the people in this small crowd was obvious: The casts, bandages, bloody stains on skin and cloth were all telling signs of injury.

Kalki’s attention would be immediately drawn to the solitary staircase to his right, from which a blue-haired, clearly foreign man in a lab coat had come running, having heard Rider’s careless entrance. 

The moment the doctor saw Kalki was the same moment he stopped in his tracks, stopping halfway down the stairs. Unlike the injured locals sitting in the lobby, the look on his face was not a dumbfounded one. 

The already snowy-skinned man’s face would grow even paler as his eyes and mouth opened wide in shock. Unless this was a cosplaying tourist who’d decided to take a trip to his crappy little clinic, this man was a-

A quick shake of the head would be all Florence needed in order to return his expression to normal. As normal as possible in the situation he found himself in, at least.

It was a perfectly reasonable move, and one Rider would have likely done if his relationship with Illyn was built on something more than mutual disgust and scorn.

Wait, where was Illyn?

<strong>HONK HONK!</strong> A car horn came from outside. What was it? A patient that was too sick to move? A FredEx™️ delivery driver? The horn didn&#39;t seem like it belonged to any delivery car? It seemed far too new and controlled, like a horn designed to alert people in traffic instead of alerting people inside a house waiting for a package.

<strong>HONK HONK!</strong>

That sound again. What was that? Rider received a message from his Master as honking filled his ears.

<em>Move eight steps to the left.</em>

Wait.

<strong>That was Illyn&#39;s car.</strong>

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em> The hood of a  1996 Lamborgini Diablo SV smashed through the recently fixed entrance, knocking Florence and several patients off their feet as half of the entrance was filled with car. The door opened and Illyn stepped out with his briefcase. He looked around.

&quot;<strong>OUT!</strong>&quot; Illyn said, his voice enhanced by Magecraft and laced with hypnosis. He looked at the various patients in the area. &quot;<strong>This hospital is not covered by your provider. Leave and return later.</strong>&quot;

Patients began running out of the now-missing doorway. Despite the stunt, no patients were seriously hurt. Was this calculated?

&quot;Apologies.&quot; Illyn said as if this was a business appointment he was slightly late to. &quot;This is a Holy Grail War. Treating people during it is both risky and foolish. <strong>Especially when you are a Master.</strong>&quot;

Illyn glanced at Florence&#39;s hands. No mark. &quot;Correction: Someone close to you is a Master. You may go. I&#39;ll move the car later.&quot; Illyn too said this casually, as if breaking into Florence&#39;s clinic was a minor inconvenience.

Florence didn&#39;t so much as think about the fact that he would be leaving behind everything he brought to Berenice, nor the patients he was about to leave behind when Illyn - the obvious Master of the intruding Servant - commanded him to leave instead of taking his life.

With what strength he had left, the doctor would get up and rush outside of his devastated clinic. Where he&#39;d end up, he wasn&#39;t sure. But did that really matter at the moment?

The room which Wilt had been staying in would shake fiercely, instilling an almost distinctive fear that the place was coming down-hardly unlikely but still certainly a poor way to go. A sort of silent prayer, a bit ironic after his initial interaction with the church, was muttered closing his eyes for a few seconds.

After the initial shaking, he&#39;d close his book, leaving it on the coffee stand and slowly rising from his seat-stretching his arms upward before making his way out of the door. His servant was certainly close by, but he still sent out a quiet message to him.

<strong>&quot;Assasin?&quot;&quot;</strong>

This was certainly the work of a servant, putting aside thoughts of faulty architecture, unless someone had managed to run their car into the building-but one was certainly more likely. His pace down the hallway was quick, but strangely relaxed. Staying in one place would certainly lead to his downfall, essentially being a massive mana flare to the inquisitive magus-perhaps the cover of the clinic below. A small knife would manifest in his hand,for the worst case scenario.

Not long after his Master called out to him, Wilt&#39;s mustachioed Assassin - outfitted with his trademark bowler hat once more - would manifest behind his Master in the hallway, joining him in his march towards the stairwell. 

&quot;To think I thought you reckless when you smashed the door to your room- How unimaginative of me. My apologies, Master.&quot;

In the back of H. H.&#39;s mind, a number of scenarios began to play out. A decent number of the doctor&#39;s patients had been left behind, and would be easy fodder for his tools... but that required they deal with their uninvited guests first, leaving no room in his thoughts for such a treat.

As a knife would appear in Wilt&#39;s hand, so would a bone saw the size of a large chainsaw appear in Mudgett&#39;s. If only his Master had the constitution of a truer mage, then he could release the <em>True Name</em> of his most favored tool. Then again, why not leave it as a little surprise for his soon-to-be opponent? A suitable option for an Assassin, no?

At the same time, there was a chance that he could make it out the window, allowing for a pincer attack by him and his Master- 

No. 

He wouldn&#39;t risk Wilt. Putting your lifeline out in the open without support was a dreadful option, even if such a move could leave their opponents wide open. There&#39;s no use in such a win. Yet, if the straight-forward approach was to be their option...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And then to the multiple eyes that would have came and stared back at him. Oh. It was actually occupied.

The servant tried to think of something witty, an excuse that could have even warranted such an intrusion when he heard a voice toward the stairwell, the concern coming from what had to have been the sole doctor of the place.

“I deeply apologize for the door, I did not think this would be a working clinic. . .”

Kalki began to start off his excuse, a true moment of embarrassment at how quick the plan had gone south because of his judgement. When he tried to fumble for the worlds on his other part of it, Illyn’s thought came in, and rather than not risk it, he did what he needed to anyways.

With the people not wanting to stay around much longer after the first part of his little <em>show</em>, now everyone scrambled for their way out with his commanding voice. Now, the hospital should have emptied out at least on the first floor.

<em>You fool, you could have killed someone else had I not been there. . .</em>

Kalki reprimanded the master, he himself searching about to see if anyone else bore the red markings similar to Illyn. His eye turned to the doctor again, going straight to his hands. . . No mark. But. . . Wasn’t that what the fireflies had relayed?

“Are you sure they had not fed your false information, Master?”

The rider sounded exhausted already, the stunt only bringing it over the top.

I already created a square footage for this building.&quot; Illyn frowned at him in annoyance. &quot;Do you think I&#39;d run somebody over with a car? <strong>Truly?</strong> With everything you know? Have some tact.&quot;

Illyn stepped by to let Florence escape. Florence likely wasn&#39;t a magus if he was being affected by such light magecraft, but you could never truly tell. He had once escaped an Enforcer of the Clock Tower by pretending to be an ordinary human escaping from a fire that he himself had started.

&quot;I am confident in my math. There is a 0.02% chance that the location we are looking for is one building over, but given this stench, it is unlikely. It&#39;s also getting worse.&quot; Illyn wrinkled his nose.

From Kalki&#39;s experience with Illyn, the man hardly seemed to react with external stimuli. Before introducing enough spice into his food to sear someone&#39;s taste buds off, Illyn ate like garbage. Yet the stench was so bad that both Master and Servant seemed to notice.

There was only one reason for the stench to get worse: its source was approaching.

IBM let out a whirring sound as it produced a heavy shotgun. With a <strong>click</strong>, the firearm was blasted vaguely into the darkness where the smell seemed to emanate from.

The magus would slowly make his way down the stairs of the hotel, each step drawing closer to the hellstorm that was down stairs.

Remaining with his Servant was clearly a must, effectively turning a 2 on...well roughly 1.5, Wilt being half a magus, into a 2 on 1. So he simply marched ahead, indifferent to his own wishes to simply remain upstairs sipping at his coffee.

&quot;Truthfully, I had expected this to happen. I didn&#39;t expect they&#39;d do it so openly however.&quot; He&#39;d frown a bit, Assasins weren&#39;t exactly known for their amazing upfront combative skills-but if nothing else they had home turf advantage and H.H had enough cunning for the both of them.

As he slowly made his way down into the lobby he was met with a loud bang. His arm would shoot out, as though moving on its own, covering his head as best as it could. He <em>could</em> potentially survive, not pleasantly of course, a shot to most parts of his body, enhancement did wonders for the unskilled, but a shot to the head-even glancing-would be a quick game over for the young master. There was also an unconscious degree of trust that his assassin would be able to stop the shot, unbeknownst to the master.

A gun was likely the  second most shocking part to Wilt as he scanned the lobby for his targets, being met with the car stationed inside of the lobby. Most <em>true</em> practitioners wouldn&#39;t even consider such an option...though he was the one holding a knife in a gun fight. Perhaps he was a third rate Magus like himself? Unlikely, very very unlikely. Cover was the second thought which crossed his mind, not exactly wanting to take a brute force of another shot-nor wanting to leave his servant on baby sitting duty.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Well if you’re not wrong or well, it’s that low. . . We should be meeting them here. I’m sure the smashed in wall is enough to wake em.”

Illyn wasted no time shooting in the dark, after all. . . That’s when the smell seemed to get progressively worse. It smelled decrepit, as if the clinic truly had rotten inside. Kalki manifested a blade in his hand, it fully healed and ready for combat while it waited for the group to show themselves. It’d be dishonorable to kill without a face to link it back to. . .

Most sane people would be challenged to trust a man like H. H. Holmes with so much as a dollar, whereas Wilt chose to do so with his life. In a moment, the trust Assassin’s master had put in him had paid off. 

Using his inhuman speed, the serial killer had reached over his master, covering the young man’s head and most of his torso with the flat side of the large saw he’d summoned only moments before. If H. H. were the usual Assassin, his blade would’ve been shoved into Wilt due to the force of the impact… but H. H. was no mere Assassin. Instead, the pellets were either flattened, shattered, or forced to ricochet off of the materialized (yet inactive) Noble Phantasm, the blade acting as a stout and effective shield for the both of them.

Discounting the destruction of the building’s entrance, the first move of this encounter had been made by the intruders- a move made ineffective in the same moment at which it should’ve been the very last move of the encounter as well.

H. H. scowled. 

Not at the fact that they’d been shot at, but at the fact that it was a smart move that he’d managed to avoid by only a few seconds of preparation beforehand and the fact that he’d manifested as a superhuman.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108971603305447525 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108971603305447525><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 11:17 PM">11:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Not wasting any time, the man would shove himself past his Master, composing himself just as what little light in the room dared touch his ghastly form. The suit-and-tie, mustache, and bowler hat would’ve contrasted well with his grotesquely enlarged saw, if only it weren’t for the monochrome nature of his entire visage competing his strange appearance. As he’d enter the visible section of the stairwell, not only would the source of the awful smell become evident, but the metallic stench of blood and cleaning chemicals would worsen to the point of becoming sickening to the average human, as would the previously inconspicuous feeling of pure malice the pair spent much too little time in the building to notice.

Without so much as a smile on his face, the infamous hotelier would finally greet his guests.

“Ah, my apologies. Unfortunately, Hotel l’ h&#244;pital has met full capacity as a result of the war, and I will be unable to get you a room for the time being.”

The end of this greeting would be punctuated with H. H. lowering his stance, so much so as to need to support himself with his open hand on the step below. 

“Allow me to accommodate with a call to the Devil. There will certainly be plenty of room in Hell!”

H. H. wasn’t one to yell, but holding one’s voice back while putting all their strength into launching themself across a room wasn’t exactly feasible, even for a usually quiet and reserved Servant.

H. H.’s first move was not an attack, but a calculated risk putting a great amount of trust into the idea that he would be able to outspeed both of his opponents and that drawing their complete attention wouldn’t result in his immediate annihilation. 

If it were possible to land behind the Servant and Master pair at a location both decently distant and equidistant from the two of them, that’s where Assassin planned to go, now wielding the saw as shield for himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Villains are so plentiful and heroes are quite in short supply.&quot; Illyn said, hand on his staff and briefcase. The irony of saying something like that when they were in a Holy Grail War—a battlefield for heroes—was not lost on the man. Life was nothing without a few ironies. &quot;You can dance with my Servant instead, he has a unique perspective on such things.&quot;

There was no big shock for Assassin—for it had to be Assassin—to block Illyn&#39;s firearms. They were haphazard and coming from an untrained marksman, shot solely for the reasoning that more variables were harder for an opponent to calculate then less were.

To some, it would be <em>unpredictable.</em> Yet to Illyn, he could calculate the projectiles of every single pellet as it fired from the shotgun. Just as he could calculate the rate of speed that Assassin was lunging towards him and Kalki.

That was to say, <em>very fast</em>.

<em>He&#39;s all yours, Rider. There is a Master for me to attend to.</em> Illyn lunged forward, barely dodging Assassin&#39;s saw as the blade sliced through a few blades of hair as Assassin lunged towards his destination, even if Assassin had been using it like a shield. As powerful as Servants were, they had to obey the laws of physics. That made them predictable.

The issue was that Illyn&#39;s body was not capable of leveraging that knowledge. It didn&#39;t matter if he knew where Assassin was going if Assassin could gut him like a fish.

Illyn stumbled due to the close call from Assassin and struggled to reload his gun. Abandoning the attempt, IBM opened, and Illyn printed a new shotgun, complete with ammunition, in exchange for the old one and its discarded ammo.

He saw Assassin&#39;s Master, nearly a boy. Illyn would&#39;ve stopped in surprise if he had a heart. Instead, he pulled the trigger on the shotgun in Wilt&#39;s general direction. If it worked, don&#39;t fix it.

This theory of course, did not account for the multitudes of variables being ran by the opposing master. He couldn&#39;t afford to slow down even for a second.

Wilt didn&#39;t waste time in his approach, seeing the man reloading. With a surprisingly hardy throw from the scrawny magus, he&#39;d send the knife at his opponent with surprising force-aiming to stop the man from being able to reload the gun and close the rather unfortunate distance between the two.

What Wilt had not anticipated was the second gun manifesting from Illyn&#39;s IBM. The boy would quickly lower himself towards the ground, sand seeming to pull itself from the carpet with suprising force. Raising his arm once more in front of him, the sand still nebulous in shape, his magic circuits burning the shape into the space in front of him, he braced himself.

<strong>BANG</strong>

Wilt&#39;s arm seemed to explode in pain as the bullets hit the packed sand shield effectively encased around his arm. Wilt staggered, would stumble back a few steps, his eyes in an almost out of place glare focused on the other magus.

The ring on his finger seemed to pulse and tighten, as though awakened by the pain itself. The entity inside mearly watching the events unfold for now.

There had to be an upper limit to what the Magus could seemingly create, but whether he could handle another direct shot was beyond Wilt to try and access. For now, he&#39;d avoid any sort of prolonged fight-rushing forward with reckless abandon in the downtime between the production of another gun. He didn&#39;t have time to produce another weapon, but the shield would have to do for now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108985849011519568 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108985849011519568><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 12:13 AM">12:13 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The idea of a pincer attack between him and H.H did cross his mind, but an Assasin such as him would struggle in close quarters confrontations such as this-unless the Master had decided to bring his archer or caster in with him.

Kalki said with little enthusiasm other than to inform the murderer of his incorrect statement. Though, now he could see who likely see who blocked the shotgun shells that Illyn fired. He seemed. . . Quite dapper. More dapper than he would have taken such an assassin to be. We’re they not monstrous in their deeds as well as appearance? The Rider questioned it only a second longer when the assassin had lunged at him, his speed unexpectedly fast, enough to at least throw Kalki off a moment before his grip became a lot more assertive. Ah, so they were much faster than the berserker— Kalki’s blade came swinging upward immediately for a means to try to create a gash on the gentleman’s chest.

Had it hit or not however, Holmes would get a sense that the Rider was much stronger than he let off, how his grip seemed to be more focused and especially more deadly. Even a moment of heat generated from the strike, enough to warm anyone too close with a foretelling that it’d boil the skin. 

<em>Fine, but we should make this quick, we need not another berserker situation.</em>

He tried to relay to his master, all while trying to prepare himself for whatever the assassin could have had under his sleeve.

As expected, the blade would rise in an attempt to strike the serial killer down. Fortunately, H. H. had the time to place the saw over himself just as he had placed it over his own Master, allowing it to take the brunt of the blow. 

One miscalculation- this Servant was <em>much</em> stronger than expected. The force of the blade-wielding Servant’s swing - and upwards strike - combined with the velocity he was already traveling at would force the gentlemanly Servant to crash into an area of the wall near the destroyed entrance, causing the building’s gaping wound to be opened up that much more. 

With a grunt, H. H. would bring himself back up off the ground, bracing for a moment as the pain from the impact registered throughout his body. Given that the hotel was no good replacement for a saloon and, thereby, lacked a spitoon, the man would be forced to spit the blood in his mouth straight onto the carpet.

A second massive saw would materialize in Assassin’s previously open hand, an exact replica of the first. Wilt was correct- H. H. was no experienced fighter. At the same time, he was quite the experienced killer, and a much more formidable opponent than an Assassin known for a single famous (or infamous) kill would be. Instead of going at his opponent with one saw while keeping the other free for defense, H. H. would dash forwards once more, swinging both saws at once from opposing angles- the one in his right hand at a downwards angle towards the neck, the one in his left hand at an upwards angle towards the liver. A one-man pincer attack.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You are new to your skills, I presume?&quot; 

Despite the disdainful tone, Illyn was relatively impressed. He did not respect those without talent. It was why he had initially respected his own Servant. He was talented in a field, and therefore warranted Illyn&#39;s respect. 

While Wilt didn&#39;t seem to me well-versed in Magecraft, Illyn commended his clever decision to summon an Assassin. It was likely efficient for his mana reserves. 

&quot;Yet if you can manipulate sand, it would&#39;ve been better to sit on the beach or even out of Benerice entirely. You&#39;d be at an advantage.&quot; Illyn looked at the sand shield. &quot;Unless there is a limit, or the sand you create is temporary. Further research is required.&quot;

The electrical staff known as Thunderclap began to charge up as Illyn swung it towards Wilt. This matchup would be mediocre at best. Sand was not the best conductor of electricity. If this magus had been a metallurgist, then it would have been easy to shock and fry his nerves with a tap. 

Yet still, he had to try. Illyn swung the device down in an overhead swing in an attempt to concuss and shock Wilt.

Perhaps in a less confrontational setting, Wilt would have inquired further on how to improve from him-but now was hardly the time to wonder about that.

The man seemed to be actively dissecting his mage craft,  if he could figure out his effective range, which likely wouldn&#39;t take long at the rate he was going,he&#39;d be wholly at a disadvantage and a low store of mana didn&#39;t allow for a battle of attrition. He had to end this quickly, unless he wanted to use his ring already...there were still too many potential masters left for him to use it up so early. 

As the copper staff was brought down, Wilt raised his shield to intercept it. As the staff connected with the shield, it&#39;s shape quickly began to shift again, aiming to wrap itself around the staff and ground it-potentially holding the more experienced magi in place if he wasn&#39;t willing to let go

The young magus would take a step forward, his left hand running across the shield, turning the bulk of it that wasn&#39;t grasping onto the staff into a thin stilleto like dagger.

He wasn&#39;t a murderer or a fighter, but it couldn&#39;t be that hard could it? He had seen H.H deal with plenty of people like this, he just had to drive it in. With a clumsy step forward, he&#39;d point the dagger towards Illyn&#39;s mid section and try to simply stab into him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And he knew, going against some lowly assassin, all he truly needed was to scare one with the possibility of death and the fight could possibly be done. But, this man, this foolish assassin seemed to have a confidence that could have put anyone on edge. 

When Holmes came back at him, he had little time to decide which would have been the best decision to have both defended, and it truly came a little too late. The saw that aimed for his neck was almost close, but in an attempt to shield it he brought his blade to meet it. A shrill sound of metal against metal came about, but then an unfamiliar sound of flesh being hacked into would have also followed it too. . . Shit, he had gotten careless.

The feeling of the blade against him was foreign, much unlike the feeling of fire searing his skin before from the fight with Herostratus. This however. . . Felt more of a moment of hell? No. He didn&#39;t have that. It&#39;d be dumb to call it that now. This was. . . Torture. 

Before he could get a moment to get another moment of victory, Kalki tried to overpower the assassin with his blade against the saw close to his neck, trying to get some sort of balance before he moved to the side, his white clothing staining red with evidence of the hit.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109339124160278568 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109339124160278568><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 11:37 PM">11:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Ah, you&#39;ve really tried proving me right. . .

He tried to keep his jovial tone, but at moments he could feel something sort of take away from such. His blade lifted for a moment before the mana around it burned for a moment, taking it to cause flame, however, just a little. He may had had similar things to the berserker, but even he knew how to handle his skill with tact. However, for H.H. Holmes, the assassin would have to dodge a lashing of flame, for once Kalki brought the sword down did it seem to be noticed what he could do. The heat would have been enough to scorch the carpet, leaving whatever in the direction it traveled with nothing but black and ash. But that was the goal! If the dapper gentleman was going to out speed him, then by all means he&#39;d torch him alive before he got the chance.

His liver had been shredded, made obvious by the quick and profuse reddening of the man’s white cloak. 

If Rider was a human - even one as strong as he was - he’d have been done for. For the avatar of a god, however, such a wound had little meaning apart from causing him severe pain. Pain that - to the chagrin of Assassin - Rider had the means to largely ignore, even with a certain skill of his being put to use. 

Before getting a chance to even withdraw his blade from Kalki’s side, H. H. would get thrown back by means of the clash happening near the Rider’s neck, causing him to lose balance and stumble backwards as he attempted to catch himself. 

The same moment H. H. would do so was the moment Kalki’s blade caught flame.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109360043293417632 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109360043293417632><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 1:00 AM">1:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>There was little time for a counter-response. Having just stopped all backwards momentum, the Assassin knew there would be no time for him to properly stance himself for any sort of jump, leap, or dash, forcing him to resort to using his saws as shields once more, placing them in front of his head and body as he had before. 

The initial blast would blow Assassin’s hat right off his head, causing it to burn up as it left the protection of the saws, which had absorbed a majority of the heat for at least half of Assassin’s body.

As for the other half - his feet and legs - the clothes and skin upon which would be immediately scorched by the heat of the flames, leaving the front of them burnt and blackened just as the carpet around had been.

Assassin would attempt to hold back a scream of pain, resulting in a powerful, yet muted groan. Just as his legs would begin to give out, he would stabilize them by shoving his saws into the ground in front of him, putting as much of his weight onto them as possible. Despite the pain, he refused to move his gaze away from his opponent, remaining deathly and unblinking as always… though Kalki could’ve sworn the man had an expression of rage upon his face, even if for but a moment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109360109995446353 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109360109995446353><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 1:01 AM">1:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I must say that I - <em>urgh</em> - truly appreciate the gesture.

There was little the be-hatted man could do in this situation. His mobility had been cut. He had options, as well as a shield to hide behind, but nothing he believed the Servant in front of him would describe in any words grander than ‘trivial’.

“You… (hiss of a sharp inhale through teeth) must be someone of great self-importance, no? To come crashing into a hospital for the purpose of what to many would be considered nothing more than a work of imagination… As a matter of fact-”

An unnatural smile would creep over not just the lower portion of Assassin’s face, but almost the entirety of his cheeks. If Kalki had any doubts as to the monster Assassin was, this inhuman act would most certainly prove it. 

“-there are plenty of patients still in the rooms above. Not that I would dare ponder as to whether or not you would mind immolating them along with this building-!”

In the midst of his dialogue, the Assassin was preparing his next attack. In letting go of one of his saws, he would be forced into an ever lower position- perfect for concealing the fact that he had reached his now open hand into his coat. Before he’d even finished speaking, the man would put what strength he could into tossing a scalpel at the face of the very same opponent he was in the middle of taunting.

“- you indecorous fiend!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An ordinary magus would steadfastly keep their Mystic Code alongside them for as long as possible. They were relics and proof of a family&#39;s research. To Illyn, it was a simple tool and research asset.

Therefore, it was exposable. Illyn let go, trading the staff for his life. It became wrapped in Wilt&#39;s sand shield.

To compensate, Illyn swung IBM upwards to dodge the sand shiv, leveraging the device&#39;s massive weight and durability as a high-ranking Mystic Code against Wilt&#39;s magecraft. The magus&#39;s attempt to kill Illyn was commendable, yet it faltered due to the man&#39;s unconventional nature as a magus.

Illyn leapt back to avoid a possible counter attack, and blinked in response to H.H&#39;s yell echoing. He inclined his head. &quot;Is your Servant lying? I can&#39;t tell. I have no social skills to my name I&#39;m sorry to say.&quot; Illyn sighed.

&quot;These are unexpected variables.&quot; Illyn explained. &quot;I have a problem with random killings, but these will not be random chance. They will be deliberate due to your Servant hiding behind them like a coward. It is understandable—he is trash—but it is commendable that he uses whatever he needs in order to win.&quot;

Was he... praising Wilt&#39;s Servant?

&quot;However...&quot;

&quot;<strong>It will not stop me.</strong>&quot; Illyn inclined his head. &quot;These nameless patients do not contradict my ideals due to how your Servant is using them. I will let them escape if they exist. If they do not...&quot;

Illyn made a finger gun and pointed it to his head. He mouthed <em>bang!</em> as he jerked his fingers.

&quot;He is telling the truth.&quot;

Wilt&#39;s arm would swing out, as the shield would release the staff, freely sending it across the room. It was unlikely he could properly use it-and frankly didn&#39;t want to risk frying himself if the cast like shield came apart.

Wilt raised an eyebrow towards the magus as he began to listen to the explanation that Illyn had given him. It made sense, logically, of course, Wilt likely wouldn&#39;t have paid much mind to the civilians himself-but there was a strange level of justification that went with his answer. 

&quot;I&#39;ll miss this place. It&#39;s unfortunate that we had to fight here.&quot; The shiv in his hand would seem to curl up, into a small orb-and seemed to be shrinking...slowly but surely.

How many more dead were needed to fulfill the mystery, he mused.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Great, it seemed to have been effective. . . The way he had forced the Assassin to have to block had been successful in some parts. The blow taking a decent chance to burn at his pants, leaving a decent scorched marking against them. And to make this even more of a slight victory, he had the lad take a knee first! Well, almost that is. 

“Well, I do tend to say that Karma often comes around when one does something, good or bad. And from the murders I hear. . . You seem to have a few strikes against you already.”

Kalki readied himself for another moment, the sword getting ready to strike another fire, the mana around him super heating in a fiery awakening. Ah, he could send this lad to his next cycle, soon enough. . . He tried to focus on it, ready to wrap it up how he felt best when Holmes had warned him of the other patients. That put Kalki at a halt for a moment, worry that the others just <em>could</em> have been above him.

He paused a moment too late, once Holmes had gotten the moment to recuperate before him, he could only see a bright shining before he had used a free hand to try to block himself, the scalpel going right into his hand. <strong>Shit.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109666270401527872 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109666270401527872><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 9:17 PM">9:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Blood dripped from the foreign object piercing him, another wound to be added to the timer. . .

“Ah, you’re a cheeky bastard. What is with villains using innocent villains as a means to cover their weakness. Even the Greek lad had done it, are you reading from the same book?”

Kalki brought his hand to his mouth, quick to rip the bandage off and yank the scalpel out of his hand with his teeth. Ah. . . That would have been a problem. . . To match his liver wound, the blood painted his hand red. The second cycle had passed.

H. Holmes. He did, however, understand that to many, if not most people, words held great sway over their psyche. 

His servile opponent’s reaction to hearing of the still-breathing bodies that existed in the rooms above them without so much as having a look for himself was as expected of a Heroic Spirit, with the result being his taking a second nasty wound. 

It would be the reaction of the opposing Master that would draw Assassin’s attention enough for him to turn an ear to him. Rather than emotion, he’d choose to speak of mathematics. Without so much as a pause, he’d chosen to throw the lives of the remaining patients away, should it become necessary. 

At that moment, H. H. came to understand not only the kind of pair his and Wilt’s opponents were, but which of the two was truly dangerous.

Whatever the case, the smile on H. H.’s face had yet to fade, standing strong even as both Master and Servant had taken the time of day to insult him. In fact, the black-and-white Assassin’s smile would grow even stronger upon hearing their words, chuckling for a moment before quickly composing himself.

“I would just hate to take the edge off your silver tongue, friend, though I feel I must inform that it was the two of you who deigned to put innocent lives in danger. There is nothing to correct in your summary of my character, but is it not obvious who the real villains are?”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109947519569506315 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109947519569506315><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 3:55 PM">3:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Assassin chuckled once more, having seen the irony in the situation… a chuckle that would become another low groan as he began to sink closer to the floor.

Had he mistaken the severity of his wound, or… had it somehow grown worse?

Keeping his eyes on his opponent over his makeshift shield, it would become apparent to H. H. that something was wrong. He was a student of medicine, not to mention a doctor. He’d seen hundreds of people bleed. Even with wounds he’d inflicted upon Kalki, there was no reason for the Rider to be bleeding the way he was.

It was unmistakably something that had to do with whoever this Servant was. Something that he’d failed to foresee. And if it was anything like the Noble Phantasm he wished he had struck his opponent with, his legs were going to be about as useful as his appendix for the time being.

There was nothing to do but hold out until he could think of something… unless <strong>Wilt</strong> could think of something.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A prudent decision, given that the staff shocked whoever grabbed it other than him. &quot;A wise choice. An ordinary magus would&#39;ve salivated all over a piece like this. It&#39;s from Atlas, after all.&quot; Illyn said as if it were nothing more than a conversation piece.

This was the arrogance of an institution that created nothing but weaponry and advanced machinery. This was the sort of device that a Clock Tower member would drool over, to have in their family&#39;s coffers. To Illyn, it was a tool. Even worse, a <strong>replaceable tool</strong>.

Yet Wilt offered it back freely. He had a good head on his shoulders, and he seemed strangely familiar. Sand magecraft...?

&quot;I will offer you a compromise, boy.&quot; Illyn kicked the staff up into his hand, before catching it. &quot;We, as Masters, can ceasefire while I remove every patient from this building. Your Servant is outclassed by mine own, yet listen as he clings to whatever he can in order to prove my Servant wrong. Look how he dribbles on about his innocence. How he blathers while his knife drips with gore! A tiring act that he continues to eek out before a <strong>god</strong>.&quot;

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong> Illyn&#39;s staff clanged against the ground as electricity arced through it. The magus swung his staff through the hotel&#39;s rotting plaster and into its wiring. Electricity coursed into the staff as it swallowed power.

<em>Excellent, Rider. Just a little bit more.</em> Illyn&#39;s voice rang in Kalki&#39;s ears.

&quot;If you do not accept my offer, I will kill you. I will kill your Servant. I will salt the earth, wipe your family&#39;s heraldry from the annuls of history. Not even the sands will remember your name.&quot;

With his tone of voice, it seemed genuine that Illyn would do something like this. He spoke of variables and numbers, of logic and reason. Kalki made him irrational, but this was his element. Everything could be calculated down to its basic elements.

The offer was, frankly, enticing at first but giving up his servant for the people above...well they weren&#39;t exactly something he had valued much to begin with...and once H.H was killed there was nothing exactly assuring Wilt himself would be safe...and was he really going to give up after coming across information on the ruler? Even if he was up against a god, even if they were both out of their league...another deal with a devil would suffice.

&quot;No thank you, sir. A god ruled over by a human is a show of arrogance far beyond what my servant could possibly muster up.&quot;

Wilt would smile faintly, as he raised his hand-revealing the command seal on it, clearing his throat.

&quot;Kill everyone within this hotel, except for me. No matter what it takes.&quot;

A mark of the command seal would fade back into his skin as he lowered his hand once more-Magic surging into the body of the killer strengthening him beyond what Wilt could possibly ever give him on his own.

The ball which he had kept hidden in his hand would reach the apex of its compression, firing out with lethal intent-intending to bore through whatever the man could project like a drill.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way he had heard the pained cry from Holmes meant that the effect was happening. It was his skill in play, the <strong>Turner of the Wheel</strong>. 

He could see that the wound on his leg was beginning to get to him, just as it got to him. How long would it take for him to fold? Dvapara? Kali? Herostratus took till Dvapara, the feeling of his ribs steadily ready to crumble under his own weight a feeling only told in myth. Could Holmes withstand that? 

Kalki had overheard Illyn, rampages, his deranged talks of gods and death. He couldn’t say it was wrong. . . But was he to feel wrong for killing the two? That was the point of damning those who were evil, no? Apart of the job one could say. . . 

Wilt’s command had been what caused Kalki however, to bulk himself up. Had he would have dared to kill everyone in this place, then Kalki himself would have tried to be what prevented such. 

“Watch what you say, friend. You say that as if I will not lay your servants life down the moment he moves. I worry not for the lives of those in this cycle. Many die, however I won’t let you get the chance to take them than when the wheel does it.”

Kalki’s blade grew once more in flame, backing his words in his determination before he made a way towards the assassin, with his one good hand, he sent a slice towards him, attempting to get a way to sever his head before he could act on his master’s command.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349989084938290 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349989084938290><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:34 PM">6:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

H. H. could barely speak a sentence in response to Kalki without pause, suffering from the pain of his burns…

Pain… burns…

Even though his legs had been burnt so severely as to be nearly unable to make any use of them… he could still feel them?

It wasn’t like the serial killer to ignore the chance to dive headfirst into such an interesting dialogue, but an experiment of sorts was necessary. Crucial, even. Putting all his willpower into trying to ignore the raging, hellish pain he’d suffer from what he was about to do, H. H. would attempt to stand. 

After raising his torso up about a quarter of an inch, he’d fall straight back into his original position. The pain was too much. He needed to be able to stand if he was going to defeat this Servant. Giving up, escaping, bartering- all improbable, if not impossible. If they were going to get out of this alive, H. H. needed to defeat a flame-wielding opponent of divine origin. 

Holmes’s mind would flood with various plans, wicked schemes that would allow both himself <em>and</em> his Master to get out of this alive. As he pondered each and every single one he considered as standing even the slightest chance of success, one thing stood out in common between all of them: If the Assassin team were to be the victors, Assassin should’ve done everything differently from the start. He’d been brash, arrogant in believing his newfound powers were going to be enough to put him on-par with heroes and legends of old. If only he’d gone for the Master from the beginning…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111051279716847637 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111051279716847637><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 5:01 PM">5:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Assassin was not one to panic. Emotion had never controlled him in life… nor would it control him in death. If ever an opportunity were to become apparent, he refused to allow his “human” side to interfere in his taking it. Should it be so that they were going to be the ones to die, he would make it so that he showed - and felt - little more than a miniscule amount of disappointment, and nothing else. A good liar was good at lying to themself as well, after all.

It was the very same moment that the last plan Assassin could come up with that had even a hair’s width of a chance as working was deemed unfeasible that a crimson glow from the other side of the room - caught by H. H. in his peripheral view - would be joined by the first words of authority the serial killer had heard his Master speak since his summoning.

In H. H.‘s surprise at Wilt, Kalki had taken the initiative, making his intent clear all the while- this was to be the finishing blow. Yet no Noble Phantasm was called for. No special action nor skill meant for a decisive maneuver was taken or used.

Nevertheless, it was still a deadly attack that needed to be avoided at all costs. The Assassin’s every instinct told him to raise his saws once more in order to block the blow. Every fiber of muscle he had began to take this course of action without the need for his mental input.

The saws would raise up off the ground before being placed above him, stacked atop one another in an X-shaped formation, one that seemed… Ill-fitted for blocking an attack to the neck?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111051396301729923 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111051396301729923><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 5:01 PM">5:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Just as blade and flame were about to reach the pale neck of Chicago’s own Dr. Death, the most spirit-like spirit would make an unexpected move. Instead of dodging up, backwards, or to the side, he would duck. 

Were Kalki any faster, H. H. would’ve lost his head. Instead, the Assassin would successfully throw himself to the ground (into a very fetal-like position), allowing the blade to pass over him and the heat of the flames to be absorbed and reflected by the saws once more.

And, with Rider’s finishing move rendered ineffective, what else was there to do but <strong>$capitalize$</strong>?

<strong>“To Hell with you, o’ Turner of the Wheel!「Tools of-”</strong>

Even with the danger that had swung above him, the serial killer’s eyes did not lay upwards. Instead, they laid <em>forwards</em>, towards his opponent. With Wilt’s command would come both a surge of energy, and a surge of renewed inspiration. His target was decided in an instant.

Despite the injuries to his own legs, he’d already determined there was still plenty of usable muscle left. Under his own willpower, he was uncertain as to whether or not he’d’ve been able to push himself to the point he needed to in order to make use of that fact. Under Wilt’s command, however, nothing mattered to H. H. more than the deaths of every living being in the hotel apart from the command’s issuer- including pain.

With a burst of adrenaline, strength, and speed unlike anything the Assassin had ever experienced before, he would dive forward in Superman-like fashion with the speed of a missile. Dive where, exactly? Easy. <em>Between Kalki’s legs.</em>

<strong>“-Desecration」!”</strong>

Following H. H. abruptly shooting past him, it would take Kalki a second to even notice that he’d been hit. Until he was unable to stand, that was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111051530729160744 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111051530729160744><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 5:02 PM">5:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>By holding his so-called Tools of Desecration forward and to the side during his dive, Assassin had cut into Kalki down to the femurs, severing in both legs a number of hip adductors, the gracilis, the vastus medialis, and a significant portion of the rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, and hamstring muscles, not to mention the large number of veins and arteries that ran through said areas.

In other words, the divine Servant’s legs had been fucked. If he were a mortal man, such a blow would render him dead in a matter of a couple minutes. In surviving the destruction of his kidney, so would he survive this. In staving off the pain of that wound, so would he stave off the pain of this wound… or so he would’ve expected.

Suddenly, the flesh around the two wounds would begin to burn and bubble as if he’d been struck by his own flames. Nay, as if he’d been struck by flame and <em>been made out of paper</em>. Soon enough, the surrounding area would blacken, and carbonized legstuff would begin slowly sloughing off. A pain beyond pain would be one of many results of this. A pain unable to be felt by those who’d suffered similar injury. A pain inhuman enough that one could imagine it should only be felt only by the souls of those that had been condemned to an eternity of torture. A pain that would almost certainly mean complete loss of the affected area - his legs - should nothing be done to combat the spreading fiery mana poison.

H. H., whose wounds had cracked and torn up much of what surrounding skin and muscle had been left as a result of the force he’d exerted in launching himself and the rough concurrent landing, suddenly seemed in better condition.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111051591093600307 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111051591093600307><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 5:02 PM">5:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“You are little more than an obstacle in the grand scheme of things, despite your grandiose blatherings- <em>gyaaaaaaa</em>!”

Not only did he look disinterested, but he also looked <em>disappointed</em> that Wilt had gone for such a hamfisted move. In a shocking move, he <em>dropped</em> IBM, allowing Wilt&#39;s sand magecraft to bore right through his side,  firing clean through his body.

Illyn automatically knew that it ruptured a kidney, and would result in internal bleeding that would kill him quickly.

&quot;<strong>URK!</strong>&quot; Illyn spat blood out onto the floor in front of him. Wilt had scored a direct hit. Despite Illyn&#39;s boasting about how tools were replaceable, he refused to put IBM into the line of action, instead taking the strike himself.

That meant, then, <strong>that Illyn valued IBM over his own life.</strong>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v06VYmoeC-g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v06VYmoeC-g</a>

Was it seriously going to be that easy? Had Wilt struck down Illyn with a cleverly placed strike? For a moment, it looked like that had a high chance of occurring.

&quot;<strong>There. Now that I know how it feels...</strong> I should&#39;ve recognized it sooner. You&#39;re that Losfeld whelp. I thought you were dead. Clearly, I was wrong. Give me a moment.&quot; Illyn gurgled before spitting out another globule of blood. IBM converted itself back into the Sony Walkman, which Illyn popped the screen of. 

Without as much as blinking, Illyn plunged his fist into the wound, and after a prolonged flash of pain, he produced a lump that looked strangely like a kidney. He stuffed it into IBM, and the Mystic Code scanned it. Afterwards, Illyn plunged the device into the wound made by Wilt.

&quot;Print.&quot; The device made a replica of Illyn&#39;s destroyed organ within his body. He looked at Wilt and shook his head. &quot;It is not arrogance if I did not ask for it. Blame those who created the system we use to fight, and allowed for humans to tame gods. Your old man would&#39;ve known that if he accepted my wedding invitation.&quot;

Then, he said something surprising.</span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGNKQklKQl1TML7ELEjYHw><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Keita Haga - Topic</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v06VYmoeC-g"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">The Ravaging Myth -COMPOSITE DEITY GORGON BATTLE-</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v06VYmoeC-g width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111116465152741436 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111116465152741436><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 9:20 PM">9:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;<strong>Yet you are right.

It&#39;s a wish that can make anything possible, yet in the end, it&#39;ll be used to fulfill some human desire. That, boy, makes it <strong>predictable. </strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>It is why the atoms that make up the human race are the worst in the 10^82 atoms in the known universe. Feel proud, knowing you and your Servant add to that miserable pile.</strong>&quot;

Illyn blinked, ignoring Kalki&#39;s plight. After a few moments, he warranted to turn towards his Servant. &quot;<strong>Noble Phantasm. My reserves are yours.</strong>&quot; A statement. Illyn could have easily told his Servant via their mental link. No, he instead opted to let Wilt and his Servant know that their <strong>existences were about to end</strong>.

For a man who just gave himself surgery, Illyn ran fast as he quickly closed the distance between himself and Wilt. He blinked, and issued a proclamation:

&quot;<strong>Death.</strong>&quot;

Then, his staff let out a massive javelin of electricity, frying the air around Wilt, striking him squarely in the chest.

He took a few steps forward, tentatively raising his shield-then froze. This man had knew who he was, more than likely meaning a connection to his father. Perhaps he was from around Egypt, or at least had some sort of ties to it.

Wilt seemed to silently contemplate on who this man was, perhaps living life as a recluse had Ill prepared him for this moment-not caring about his own family&#39;s connections beyond the money which they had been able to procure prior to his death.

&quot;Do you expect me to pity you?&quot; The question almost seemed genuine as he continued his approach.

<em>&quot;I&#39;ll finish this soon Holmes.&quot;</em> A proclamation of victory, perhaps a bit too soon-but few people could last a wound like that. Magus or not.

Then the man tore out that lump of flesh. Perhaps if Wilt hadn&#39;t been around Assasin for as long as he had, he would have felt sickened by such an act. Perhaps a curse, voodoo? It didn&#39;t matter. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to use it as predictably as you speak.&quot; His tone was very monotone, but his annoyance was almost palpable in it. Someone, seemingly so detached from the war, from even the concept of being a magus with his wonton use of everything he had...save the strange device he had carried with him.

&quot;Please give my father my condolences, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be happy to hear about your wedding.&quot; He&#39;d breath out, moving his head ever so slightly backwards as if to reorient his glasses.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111147304146194485 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111147304146194485><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 11:22 PM">11:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The sand from the shield would coagulate into a new shape, a weapon to stop the master once and for all. A god wouldn&#39;t last long without a master-but with the sudden lunge he couldn&#39;t have possibly blocked the newly charged Lance-which seemed to almost pass through his mana circuits protections without any hassle. It was almost enough to wonder if the boy was even a magus to begin with. And his heart seemed to have stop, Wilt knocked to the ground like a sack of bricks.

The world seemed to turn black. Had he died? He mused-no the burning in his chest seemed to be evidence enough of that, his nerves shot throughout his body, burns spread across his chest. Truthfully, even if he had wanted to move-it was unlikely that his body would even listen to his commands. He was dying, from what he could tell. 
 
His thoughts seemed to race, like a slurry of words and ideas. A last hurrah before he&#39;d go on his way...before silence as a being which demanded his attention simply turned his eyes on Wilt. A presence seemed to almost envelop him, the errant thoughts fading. Without a word it almost seemed to communicate what the boy had to do, but that same gravelly voice spoke anyways.

&quot;ɢᴇᴛ ᴜᴘ.&quot;

Wilt didn&#39;t want to die, and so the transaction had went through. Pain seemed to shoot through his body further, as though his veins were pumped full of hot metal. A dull thumping would follow, as the body fiercely seemed to reject the staffs influence.

The body of the young magus would twitch once, and then twice before his eyes would open once more, slowly forcing himself up. Sand seemed to shift, around him-ever so slightly. He&#39;d slowly wipe at his nose with his sleeve, blood smearing across the white. Wilt&#39;s eyes seemed to slowly turn towards Kalki, a strange brass tint seeming to have over taken them. Sand seemed to shift around them, ever so slightly, like a reverberation of an engine.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dvapara Yuga</strong>

To have thought that the man had enough strength to block his strike. . . Kalki couldn&#39;t say that this was not something that surprised him, but surprises were nothing to Vishnu, and so it would be nothing to him either. He tried to brace himself for more strength in his assault, wanting to hope to push through it all when he felt his liver slowly tear away at itself. The buzzsaw had been a menace to his body, and while it hadn&#39;t been inside him for long, its effects and damage only increased with the incoming battering. Muscles pulled away from each other like intertwined string, and soon enough his hand felt a darkening, his fingers slowly coming closer to a prickly cold sensation of them eventually ready to die off. But, that wouldn&#39;t keep him from continuing. 

When he felt he could overpower Holmes, the madman made his successful attempt to escape, but not before unleashing another nasty would on Kalki&#39;s strong legs. Catching up immediately with the timing of the Dvapara Yuga coming up, his legs damn near burst with loose muscle and nerves causing the incarnation to yell heavily at hellish feeling of it all. He hadn&#39;t gotten use to his liver becoming worse for wear each stalling moment the Assassin managed to pull off, but the way everything collapsed in his legs, it was as if he had simply ripped everything from them. 

He could feel himself ready to hit the floor, his body letting the cradle of gravity lull him closer before he stabbed his blade into the ground with his decent hand, its metal tip piercing whatever carpet was there holding it, burning away at it slowly. He hadn&#39;t even been able to notice Illyn&#39;s wound, that his kidney ripped and copied about, only the hole he had to show it, but by then, he had his attention diverted back to Holmes. His spiel on those who he’d murdered, the thought of it all ate at him.

However, with his sword he stood as determined as he could, even with his liver failing every second, and his hand damn close to amputation.

“<strong>You lot are truly despicable then. . . And now hearing such a passion of yours, I have no choice but to enjoy the idea of wiping you from the wheel entirely.</strong>”

Though his body weak, his voice came with a sense of authority, as if he had gone down an octave to scold the two that seemed to show little care of the lives of others. . . And that was when the heat came. It would have not been something many could have expected, but for Holmes, Wilt, and Illyn, a wave of what could have only been described of a barren heat swept the hotel, and with it, his blade began to glow till it too caught ablaze. 

“<strong>You who has tried to speed the wheel of the cosmos, Brahma’s . . . Shiva’s. . . <em>Vishnu’s</em> creation. The world is clouded by human action, and the Kali Yuga proves such!</strong>”

In response to Kalki’s accusations, the floor caught ablaze, the fire spreading quickly before the air seemed to go dry. . . The mana. . .The very <em>air</em> around them became brittle. The walls grew older, the paint began to wear itself, patches of it peeling as if they had gone years past its original state.

“I shall wipe away the evil in this world. <strong>Mahapralaya and Kalachakra Tantra – Erasure</strong>.”

For a moment, Holmes would feel the wounds cleansing, the pain in his legs subsiding, but the heat from the fire seemed too dangerous to test. What oxymoron was this, to heal and yet harm, to create and break. It wasn’t long before the building seemed to catch up with just the first floor. . . Unfortunately, for those who were caught in the place, it would have come to an end many would have thought only hell could bring, but Kalki knew how his noble phantasm worked. They’d learn that the wheel had its ways with life.  

Things that began to rot only decayed faster, the clock ticking with more intensity. And within it all, the Incarnation of the Preserver god. His posture straightened for a moment, the once slashed legs began to knit themselves back together, each piece of tendon, flesh, and even neuron repiecing itself as if it were to never have been sliced away like deli meat. What . . . What would happen once his blade burned brightest? Only seconds could tell from the result.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111451732220854282 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111451732220854282><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 25, 2023 7:32 PM">7:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

H. had nearly neglected to keep an eye on the Masters’ side of things. 

<em>”I’ll finish this soon, Holmes.”</em>

Having heard such a statement, Assassin would make use of Kalki’s suffering, taking a moment to turn his head - and attention - to the other side of the broken hotel lobby. 

It appeared that he had wounded his opponent’s Master. From first glance, the lethal nature of the attack was apparent to the serial killer, giving him all the information he needed about their battle… or so he thought. 

A hand over one’s wound was usually a sign of great pain, and H. H. had assumed as much. Rather quickly, he found something wrong with what he was looking at. Unperturbed was the best way to describe the rival Master’s expression. His hand didn’t appear to be laying over the wound, but <em>inside of it</em>, as if he were grasping something.

…Arrogance… predictable… worst… miserable… <em>Noble Phantasm</em>... <strong>death</strong>.

Had H. H. any time to think over what Illyn had said, he’d have wondered exactly what made this man the way he was. Nothing so much as a single person having missed his wedding, obviously.

“Noble Phantasm” was enough of a sign of danger that H. H. had taken his eyes off of the Masters for but a moment. Kalki was doing his best to stand, doing his best to resist the shared and continually worsening pain that Wilt’s Command Spell allowed his Servant to simply ignore. Looking was a wasted effort… a precious moment in the midst of combat wasted.

One moment much too long.

By the time the Assassin’s eyes’ drifted back to the Masters, Wilt was on the ground.

“Damn!”

…Despicable…

There was no time to wonder what had happened to his Master, nor why he had yet to feel himself beginning to fade away.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112064727321940078 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112064727321940078><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 27, 2023 12:08 PM">12:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Turning back to Kalki, a wave of ungodly - no, <em>divine</em> - heat would suddenly encompass the entirety of their surroundings. 

To H. H., it would seem that this avatar of a god had brought the Hell that he so desperately sought right to him. Everything about existing at this very moment had become torture. Breathing had become extremely painful. Whatever mana had been there seemed to burn and disappear. The very building they were within aged years upon years upon years, becoming just as ugly as the souls of its current inhabitants. So why did it seem that everything had been healing at the same time?

It was an inescapable, infinite cycle of pain and suffering, cleansing and healing.

If Kalki had been staring down H. H., it would not be fear that he would see. Nor sorrow, nor anger, nor even joy. What Sri Kalki would see upon the serial killer’s face would be… 

Longing. 

An expression quickly replaced by one much more serious- that of a focused killer. A sign that Wilt’s Command Spell had been quick to take over in the face of what had almost looked like surrender. 

Uncertain of what was about to happen, H. H. would react purely on instinct, throwing himself to his knees and placing his Tools of Desecration vertically in front of him, creating that same pavise that Kalki had been largely unable to pierce as of yet.

Would his saws be enough…?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet from Illyn&#39;s perspective, Wilt was adequate as a magus, but not some first-rate instructor from the Clock Tower who could take on every Master uncontested. Even his sand-based magecraft was a novelty.

No, that wasn&#39;t fair. It had done an adequate job. It was perfectly respectable, even if Illyn was unwilling to respect Wilt following his proclamation. Not like it mattered, the boy was dead anyway.

Then, the debris cleared.

&quot;<strong>No. No. This is unexpected. It&#39;s unpredictable. What am I looking at?</strong>&quot; Illyn leaned on his staff to survey the damage in disbelief. After a moment, his eyes widened. He was from a magus family who had lived in the desert for generations upon generations. He knew what this was.

<em>Rider...</em> No, they had a chance to lose still. Wilt was an unexpected variable. Assassin was finished, anyway. The only way to win this now was for Rider to hurry up and finish H.H before Wilt&#39;s power turned the tides.

Yet Illyn was no fool. It was logical to presume the other side was expecting this, too, and would focus on killing his rider. That left only one option:

<strong>Kalki could not die.</strong> This was both realization and a thought directed towards Rider. <em>We&#39;ve run into an unexpected variable. Kill Assassin. Hurry.</em>

He would not lose anything to unpredictable nonsense again.

Even without IBM, Illyn was relatively competent. He already knew the structural weaknesses of the building. Most of his other rooms of thought had calculated everything from the amount of termites the building contained to the average area. That contained the structural weaknesses that Kalki was eroding.

Pointing his shotgun up at the ceiling between him and Wilt, he shot at it. The ceiling collapsed, and Illyn disappeared as the rubble collapsed downward.

Pain seemed to ebb through his body, as though running on legs which had never been used-but he&#39;d deal with that later, adrenaline pumping through just as easily as the mana.

Changing the shape of sand was, admittedly, fairly complex to handle on what was effectively a unfueled engine but now it seemed to almost as simple as breathing. 

But rather than a torrent of sand bursting in, even in its magnitude likely wouldn&#39;t be enough. The foundations of the building itself seemed to shift, ever so slightly-almost dully . Stone and concrete spears would impale the empty space where Illyn once was, tearing the gaudy rotting carpet in its wake.

A quiet muttering of a curse under his breath, the ceiling between the two caving in. He&#39;d turn himself toward Assasin and his seemingly inevitable demise at the hand of the proper knight servant. Hurting a servant even interrupting, it was an immutable impossibility under most circumstances for the average Magus. But for the few moments which Wilt held onto the mass of Mana, he&#39;d do what he could.

The ground itself began to shift under rider, the ground cracking as sand and concrete flowed out of the rapidly aging environment-acting as a wall between Kalki and H.H. It would be madness to assume such a wall could stop a god&#39;s noble phantasm-but rather its expansion would be to push his servant further away. Perhaps there would be a falling off of force with range or perhaps the wall would decrease the strength of the blow?  In any case, the burden of the attack would still fall upon his companion, if lessened.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fire were truly the pits of hell itself, burning and scorching things in the building, and the building too, so it’d be harrowing that at some point, the they stopped at some point outside the building, refusing to burn other innocent ones that would have been caught in the crossfire. To the general public, it was have been strange, enough to cause alarm and have people gather and for immediate attention to try to come and put it out, but the flames never seemed to die down.  That was. . . Not until Holmes braced himself.

“So, begone with a swift strike. You’ll not return next cycle.”

And for it, the flames reversed, wave upon wave came back to the sword that was hilted, its metal blade growing to a burning white, and soon to a ghostly pale, as it revealed all that had aged, from inorganic to the charred bodies that only lay above them. It seemed it was time.

Right when he heard the shotgun hit the roof, Kalki took his chance, taking the glowing blade from the floobrboards and gave it the best swing he could manage, the sand that Wilt had began to try to pull around him heating up into a beautiful glass from the heat of it all. But why was it doing that? It was because the light that had left the blade entirely.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112436930542567486 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112436930542567486><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 28, 2023 12:47 PM">12:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>From it came a bright light, heavenly and divine on its own, and with just that, a burst of mana around the entirely building returned, forcing the a beautiful sense of vitality in all that had been taken from.

Within the slash, walls were painted back to their beautiful state, the doors once burned and full of ash seemed to come to their prime, even the people of it seemed to return from their dry husks, their bodies shiny with sweat but alive. 

For Holmes, Wilt, and even Illyn, this light planned on filling up every part of the building. The heat felt like no other, and yet it would ruin all in its way. Kalki’s body however, couldn’t handle much more, even with how his legs no longer would have deteriorated, or his liver not shredded in its entirety, it was still a taxing move.

There would be no time to react to anything else. Not the physical changes in the building happening around him, not the fact that Wilt had suddenly become a monster of a mage for reasons unknown to himself, nor the sudden appearance of glass that would quickly come to shatter as a result of the sun-like heat building upon Kalki’s blade.

As the godly Servant began to raise his blade - the first motion of an attack - it became apparent that the time had come. 

Powered by not only a Command Spell, but Wilt’s own surge of magical energy, he would put all the power he could into throwing himself to the side, raising his Tools of Desecration where he believed he was likely to be struck.

For a moment, it would appear to H. H. that everything had come to an end. Bright light would be all he would see, and intense inferno would be all he would feel.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Coming to would come with the quick realization that he was unable to move. Unable to feel much of anything. 

H. H. had been burnt to a crisp. There wasn’t a single part of his body that hadn’t been burnt, if not entirely carbonized on the exterior. In a funny way, it made him appear more human, now lacking most, if not all features that had made him <em>him</em>. It was through the protection of his own Noble Phantasm that his head and one arm were the least injured, allowing him to hold on to his senses… but that likely didn’t matter now. 

One leg was missing entirely. One arm was gone at the elbow. One saw had been melted to a degree of being entirely unusable. 

The serial killer had survived the blast. Now he was going to die.

Forced into staring at the sky, his eyes would move slightly from side to side, taking in the view. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky to block the view of the full moon above. Shining gold flecks - spiritrons from both himself and his broken weapon - would dance beautifully up into the air, their glow contrasting beautifully against the dark sky above, seemingly making their way to that big illuminated space rock that humanity has been obsessed with since conception.

He’d’ve closed his eyes if it were possible. A man like him getting to experience such a scene was utterly pointless. If dissected, H. H.’s heart would be found clear of any emotion whatsoever. He had lost, but there was always next time. As long as the Throne kept him, he’d look for a way out of it. Whether Wilt lived or died as a consequence was of no concern to him, nor were the lives of any other participants. Whoever lived to grasp the Grail was likely going to make a wish that had little effect on himself, so there was no need for any concern nor pondering.

All there was left to do in this life was to wait for it to end…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An attempted noise of surprise would escape the serial killer’s lungs as a voice echoes through his one working ear. With all the strength he could muster, H. H. would turn his neck, attempting to get a look at whomever had approached him.

Keeping his eyes open through the pain, Assassin’s new view was that of a young man around Wilt’s age. From appearance alone, it was apparent that he was a tourist, wearing western clothing and bearing a longer hairstyle than was generally accepted in the regio. He’d gotten down on his hands and knees to H. H.’s comparatively uninjured side, yet kept some distance as to not get too close to the heavily injured person.

H. H. found it strange that he’d come closer rather than freeze up or run away as a result of what had been happening within the hotel. Was it the work of a kind, brave heart, perhaps? A kind, brave… <em>foolish, gullible</em>... <strong>heart</strong>.

“C -<em>gasp</em> - clo-ser…”

As if he’d been commanded to, the tourist would inch closer to H. H., stopping plenty far from him despite what could have been his dying wish. From his body movement and the look on his face, it was obvious that fear was the only thing holding him back. 

So H. H. would smile.

A smile that would normally creep even bugs out appeared normal on his burnt face, the muscles that would normally pull that joyful expression to the limits having been weakened to the point a regular smile would appear instead.

“P-<em>gasp</em>-please…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There would be no time for a response of any sort. Not even a scream.

In one moment, Assassin thought all had been lost. The next, he was bailed out by pure luck. For whatever reason, the world had been intent on keeping him here. 

Though his jaw was considerably damaged, the joints still worked enough that he found himself able to chew through the use of his working arm, doing his best to work out all the magical energy he could from the fist-sized morsel.

Such a strong taste of blood would leave H. H. feeling as if he’d submerged himself in the trough he left his victims hanging above to drain them of the vile liquid. A feeling that would soon become that of vigor and vitality as he found much of his body’s function restored. His missing leg would return to him, as would a large portion of his skin and surface muscles.

Within a heart’s beat, the serial killer would be up again, rushing at the beleaguered Kalki with the remaining, now-inactive Tool of Desecration. Mind and body still strengthened by Wilt’s command spell and djinn-powered power-up, an attempt would be made to cleave through his opponent’s neck once more. Only this time, he would hit. Unanswered, it was going to be a fatal blow.

Assassin&#39;s knife, instead of meeting Rider&#39;s flesh and mangling the Servant&#39;s Spirit Core, it met something else. A defensive Noble Phantasm? A technique? If he failed now, Holmes would taste Kalki&#39;s sword and be utterly atomized.

Yet Rider still stood.

&quot;<strong>Urk.</strong>&quot; Illyn vomited blood onto Holmes&#39;s face as the Servant&#39;s strike impaled itself deep into Illyn&#39;s chest, crushing his heart. He blinked once, twice, then thrice. He took a deep breath.

&quot;<strong>How unpredictable.</strong>&quot; Illyn Mariston collapsed into a heap as the life left his eyes. 

A static-filled voice rang out in Kalki&#39;s head:

<em>I hate you. How dare you point out a contradiction in my line of thought. This is the only viable solution, now. The only goal that lends itself to a checkmate against all other Masters.</em>

<em>Preserve your wheel. Preserve every life that would dare be taken by sheer random chance. By this squalling whelp of an Assassin.</em> Illyn&#39;s voice snarled in both reality and in Kalki&#39;s mind.

&quot;<em><strong>It&#39;s just one scenario. It is all within calculations. Just you wait, Assassin. Losfeld. My Rider will kill you. Just you wait. It will all go according to plan.</strong></em>&quot;

Illyn&#39;s hand reached up towards the ceiling as he died. &quot;Evi...&quot; That name belonged to someone important, once. Now, all that was left was a directive and order. &#39;He&#39; had not succeeded in that directive.

That was fine. Illyn was satisfied as his breathing ceased.

But in comparison this was truly hell, the bright colors of the hotel turned a deep charcoal black-dripping from the walls like rain. Wilt raised more cold stone to, hopefully, stave off whatever heat he could. Dying from these flames surrounded by water, it was almost poetic.

Had Wilt not been gifted with the full capacity of his circuits, he would have certainly died from just the intensity of the heat. It was an awful way to go, perhaps he should have just accepted the-in comparison-pretty respectable way to go.

The world seemed to flash a brilliant white, for a moment and then another, pain aching through his body-his clothes sticking to the burns as they manifested. Perhaps this was heaven? No, he certainly wouldn&#39;t be going there-he had made quite the enemy of god with his trip to Egypt.

When the light had faded, Wilt was back on the ground of the hotel-his breath slow and staggered. The air seemed almost abnormally cool, spared from the heat of the light for a moment. Glass walls seemed to have appeared around him, shattering as the world seemed to cool down for even just a moment and coincidentally stopping the ceiling from falling down upon the worn Magus at least somewhat.

He was alive, for now, having spent his sum of the rings mana to handle the heat. He slowly began to pick himself up, shakily at first before collapsing. Pain shot through his arms, beyond the burns, like needles picking at the flesh itself-his arm turning a stone grey.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113517666540453949 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113517666540453949><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 31, 2023 12:21 PM">12:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And then Illyn had gotten killed by Assasin.

That should have done it. That final blow should have been just enough to atomize that poor lad right back into the throne of heroes where he would have been best. His legs were strong enough to hold himself, though he buckled easily under his own weight. The Incarnation steeled himself, though he had dealt a finishing blow. . . He could still sense there was mana in the area, and it rose exponentially.

As the debris cleared, he was able to see what all had been there, a man with his heart taken out, surgically or messily, it didn&#39;t matter. Another victim, another calamity of the same proportion. It seemed many servants had been of the same disgusting cloth, killing the innocent, using their hearts for the greed of themselves. It was disgusting. 

For a moment, it had taken time to try to go and find his master, the chalky air settling down yet Illyn was nowhere to be seen. He knew that his technique would have been strong, but truly Illyn wouldn’t have died to such a move, no? Died when he talked so fervently about breaking the cycle of randomness that life had given him. . .  No, that would have been entirely like him. And yet, when the Rider had tried to theorize where he was, he hadn’t noticed that Holmes had planned on trying to finish the fight.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113820877642010654 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113820877642010654><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 8:26 AM">8:26 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Before he could react, the sound of flesh had been so unfamiliar to him in a close sense.

Had one watched it from afar, it’d lose its full beauty, how the blood first clotted from his neck before it let a spray of ichor into the carpets and walls of the hotel, one had to have been close to see it in a sense of wonder. He had rose his sword ready to defend himself, but there was no impact for him. The blood spray not his, nor the tearing of his neck. In fact, he had found his master, Illyn’s body strewn carelessly between Holmes’ blade and his own, taking the brunt of it all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113820979286790234 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113820979286790234><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 8:26 AM">8:26 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His body fell with a <strong>thud</strong>, blood quick to follow and paint the carpets a mirror of red.

It became a sense of binary. He would be alive, then soon dead. 

The Rider could feel a pang already aching inside him, the trembling of mana? Guilt? It could have been either or. But already, it seemed to be calling to him. Kalki bent down, a look of confusion, hate, anger, and sadness all torn on his features, darkening them with age, and then another moment of tiredness fell to it as well. The same look he had had before, when he had heard of all the murders he had been ignorant to. 

“You idiot. . . “</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113821105451438202 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113821105451438202><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 8:27 AM">8:27 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Illyn’s words had come to him, though he had no way to show that he could have processed them. Was he to be proud? Proud that his master had backed from his argument before? Was he angry? Angry that his master had done such a thing in the midst of battle, knowing that such a move could have cost him his life too? He could already feel that gnawing urge for mana toy with him. . . What was he to do with that? He wouldn’t eat at a heart, that was for sure. But Illyn, how in the hell was he to manage now like this. He could feel the link between them slowly become more and more distant, the feeling of a pool of mana drain and dry, he had little time to live. Which meant that <em>Kalki</em> too had little to live. 

A fraction of a moment passed, a split moment where he had to make a decision, to follow a path he had to choose. Illyn conceded to his idea of the wheel, but did he have enough time to even do such? He couldn’t tell. The connection dwindled more. . . The feeling of a heart rate plummeting as he wasted time. He had to make a decision. He <strong>needed</strong> to. And when he finally could hear it, the small utterance of her name, it was clear. 

A blade would be taken, while he had it, as a duty. He had been told to preserve the wheel as long as he could, and thus, that would be what he would do. If not for himself, if not for Illyn, then it would be to show the man that the wheel went on with or without him. The rider stumbled forward, though his legs were not as strong as they needed to be, the curse on them had been cleansed, and his hand, while not in the best condition, it too was enough to function with. It was simply a matter of doing it. Kalki rose his blade once more, signifying that he would not die, yet it was easy to see he clenched onto what little mana he had. . . Specks of gold light had begun to emit from him, floating towards an unknown destination.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113821168684781599 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113821168684781599><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 8:27 AM">8:27 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“I will fulfill this fool’s mission.

What more was there to say?

He would not die here, not yet. Not now.

Had to keep running, even if it meant hastening the inevitable, risking his very existence.

<em>(I am vulnerable in so many ways...)</em>

He tried to hold onto his identity, his purpose, and the extraordinary destiny that awaited him. The proximity to death&#39;s door overwhelmed him with a deluge of memories and conflicting emotions. The chaos consumed him, his thoughts spiraling out of control while the voice within his head grew louder and louder still.

<em>(Time is running out...)</em>

Kalki acknowledged the undeniable truth. His time was indeed running out. The once resplendent radiance of his sword had dimmed. The flames had all but extinguished. Everything around him cooled, like glass that had been superheated before plunging into icy, cold water and...

Shattering into pieces.

His very core fractured. Suddenly, he found himself adrift, consumed by an overwhelming, suffocating darkness, falling in an eternal abyss...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Vector lines wrapped all around him, curving, intersecting, and intertwining into a mesmerizing lattice that fabricated the very plane on which he stood, then extended into the vast expanse of space beyond. Overhead loomed a colossal pendulum, swinging without a discernible axis and influencing his conception of space and time.

He looked down, and there <em>it</em> floated, separated from him by the plane, like a goldfish trapped in a fish tank. Kalki knelt down and tried to examine the being closely, but <em>it</em> remained unresponsive in its plight...

Drowning. The shadow was drowning.

Kalki looked around, but there was nothing. He had lost everything, bereft of his sword, his strength, so all he could do was press his hands against the surface and shout, &#39;How can I help? Tell me! How can I be of aid to you?&#39;

<em>It</em> opened its eyes.

<em>You are needed,</em> it said. <em>Necessary. Essential. INDISPENSIBLE...</em>

<strong>&#39;Tell me!&#39;</strong> Kalki pounded the glass.

And the surface broke. Water poured through the cracks, and the being ascended, its body riddled with countless holes and allowing Kalki a glimpse of the cosmic expanse within. Struggling, <em>it</em> wrapped its hands around his own.

<em>MINE...</em>

They connected. A tremendous force pulled Kalki to the other side. Water surged around him, engulfing his legs, then his chest, stealing away his breath. The surface of the water rose far above him, and even as he fought to swim to the surface, the water rose higher still, swelling up like a tidal wave then crashing down on him, weighing him down, the lattice of vectors forming a soft but impenetrable net over his head...

The water&#39;s surface stilled. Kalki found himself trapped on the underside of the plane. Gravity seemed to have inverted itself, and the being, now liberated from its former prison, nestled on the surface, curling above him like a small dragon that had finally found its treasure.

High above, the pendulum continued its rhythmic swing.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He clasped Illyn&#39;s outstretched hand, as if engaging in an introductory handshake. Then, with his other hand, he swiftly ripped the bone saw from the former Atlassian&#39;s flesh like removing the spine from a lifeless fish. Wounds began to mend at a visible pace, as the Cycle started anew...

&#39;And you,&#39; his innocent eyes locked onto Assassin&#39;s. &#39;I don&#39;t need <em>you</em>.&#39;

A geyser of blood would erupt from the mouth and gaping wound of his unintended victim, blanketing the serial killer’s burnt, bruised, and battered body with a dark sheen of crimson, hiding the many, many wounds he’d been left with as a result of going one-on-one with a stronger Servant. At this point, it was a familiar sight to those in the lobby. 

There would be no celebration. No smile. No words. No movement of facial muscles nor any other that would indicate one had just claimed victory in a fight to the death. Illyn’s death at his hands would be given as much regard by H. H. as his final words: Little to none.

<em>“Have you done it?”</em>, Wilt would ask his Servant.

<em>”No.”</em>

H. H. knew better. As long as Kalki lived… stayed materialized… there was no telling what was going to happen. Every emotion, every twitch, every movement of the eyes from Kalki would be carefully - and silently - observed. Assassin was close to death, himself, and he knew it. He’d one arm, one working eye and ear, and one saw, the latter of which - his one and only defense against a Servant’s strike - was stuck in the ribcage of the man he’d slain just moments prior.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114779922783805572 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114779922783805572><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 11:57 PM">11:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As expected, Kalki would rise once more, spouting off words of this and that as he and his Master were apparently fond of doing. What words were spoken were of little matter. It was the fact that he’d decided to pick up his blade in order to remove H. H. from the cycle that brought worry to Assassin. Every step Kalki took towards H. H. would be acknowledged by an additional tug of the blade deep in Illyn’s chest cavity in an attempt to get it loose, the no-longer mustachioed man aware that the only way for him - for his and Wilt’s wishes - to survive was to avoid taking a lethal hit.

<em>Step. Crunch. Step. Grind. Step. Crack.</em>

Nothing. 

But he refused to stop trying. Even if things looked impossible, H. H. was never going to stop looking for chances. Such was the only thing that had - as of yet - been winning the Assassin pair the fight, and such would be the reason that they would come out of this the survivors. Pouring every ounce of strength he had into tugging the blade, he’d pull once more. 

Only to fall to his knees. 

There wasn’t a bit of magical energy left in Assassin’s body. The quick, powerful dashes, the activation of his Noble Phantasm, the incredible amount of damage he’d sustained at the hands of Sri Kalki… all of it had drained H. H. Holmes so severely that he not only found himself unable to free his remaining Tool of Desecration from Illyn, but unable to keep himself on his newly refurbished legs. For it was Wilt’s cursed ring and Command Spell that had given H. H. the power to fight halfway through, and both had finally ran out of potency. If Sri Kalki wanted to kill H. H. Holmes for everything he’d done in this new life, it would’ve been the time to do so. Instead, the crippled, nearly lifeless Assassin would watch as the disintegrating Rider’s sprint slowed to a full stop, right in front of him. The clatter of Kalki’s sword would work to startle the failing Assassin, who’d been prepared for the pain of the blade splitting him open.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114779991905939466 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114779991905939466><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 11:57 PM">11:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It became immediately apparent to H. H. that something had changed about Kalki. With what consciousness he had left to muster, Assassin would take in every bit of information about this… new… Kalki that he could. A spurt of pure focus that would be quickly and easily broken by Kalki so easily ripping Assassin’s blade from his hands, resulting in the man being sent sprawling backwards and ending up staring up into the ceiling just as he’d stared up into the sky following his near-lethal encounter with the Rider’s strongest Noble Phantasm.

No vocal response would be drawn from H. H. despite Kalki’s decision regarding whether or not the serial killer was “needed” by him, though he’d dare to show a half-scowl out of pure spite for having eye contact made with him while in such a sorry state.

H. H. would draw a sharp, deep breath in order to respond to this Kalki’s invitation, only to be interrupted by the clacking of a helmet bouncing down steps. An interruption that would come with a change in Assassin’s train of thought.

<strong>“Who… are you…?”</strong>

There was no politeness to his question. No friendly, gentlemanly touch nor passive, subliminal, seductive tone. Instead, there was true emotion. Fear, anger, confusion. 

“What… how… when did… <em>fa-ther</em>…” 

The one eye H. H. had left would roll back into his head. A full second would nearly pass before his limbs would begin to fade, after which his body would be quickly consumed by absolute nothingness. No, it wasn’t death. It was dematerialization into Spirit Form, the result of Assassin running on fumes for so long.

For some good while, Wilt would find no more response from Assassin, even through their mental link.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the servant losing his master, he still seemed to persist. But there was a sort of comfort, even if H.H was up against a proper knight class (probably) he could handle a dying man-if anyone could handle someone who is dying it&#39;d be his Assassin. Wilt&#39;s arms would slowly lose whatever leverage they had with his body, letting him sink back down against the carpet-feeling cleaner than it probably has in years, save the dust, glass and sand.

Then they&#39;d clash once more, with H.H falling at the hands of the dying servant. No, it appeared that the servant was no longer dying. Was the master still alive? H.H wouldn&#39;t make such a grievous mistake, or so the young magus had hoped.

Wilt&#39;s eyes would slowly bring theirselves up to the strange servant. There was some sort of change that had occurred, something that he didn&#39;t understand- with a strange child like voice coming out of the once imposing &quot;god&quot;. Then he had picked up the strange briefcase which Ilyn had protected with his own body. What would a servant want with a magic code such as that? Perhaps some master was after it, even it if just seemed to be a way to project random items. It was probably valuable up.


Then H.H had dissipated, reduced to his spirit form-not dead even if he was on the brink of it. 

&quot;<em>Are you..</em>&quot; The connection&#39;s voice seemed to pause, unable to fully articulate his concerns into the void.

His eyes gazed upon the rider for a moment, and then another before simply lowering his head to the carpet once more-pain and exhaustion taking him down for now. He&#39;d have to force himself back up, sooner rather than later, but couldn&#39;t muster the strength in the state he was in.

They&#39;d certainly have to find the strange new(?) servant later, but for now-he was going to lick his wounds...he didn&#39;t seem especially interested in taking them out despite being competitors for the grail. Perhaps they had some plan which involved him and Assasin...or perhaps simply didn&#39;t care, and</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115730685949386792 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115730685949386792><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 6, 2023 2:55 PM">2:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>was to be taken at face value.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;See,&#39; he said brightly, as H.H. dissipated into spirit form. &#39;Even a Servant&#39;s gotta eat sometime.&#39;

He stopped in front of the car on his way out.

It broke.
