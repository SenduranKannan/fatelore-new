He hadn’t stood here in years. Everything from the ornate sandstone and marble walls engraved with hieroglyphs to the circuitry that ran beneath, Atlas resembled a circuit board carved into the crust of the earth more than anything. The room was vacant, currently. Illyn couldn’t see the ceiling, but he recognized this as the entrance to Atlas itself.

This was the last room he had seen before leaving this place behind. Illyn Neph Mariston had never looked back from this room after killing his mother.

The memories were flooding back. Was he dead? A personal hell of his own creation? No, no. This was simply a stepping point. He felt like he <em>should</em> know what the purpose of this room was, but he didn’t. All he felt was a sense of familiarity. He had been here before.

Not ‘here’, as in the room located within Atlas, but ‘here’ as in this very space.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114451318405337128 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114451318405337128><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 2:11 AM">2:11 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Why was he remembering things?

Mariston.

B? Did he ever have a middle name? His parents had never agreed on one, and it took up space on paperwork. What had the B stood for, again? Illyn had forgotten long ago. Now, he simply remembered the B that marked every signature he ever made.

B…

What did it mean?

Illyn took a step forward, and saw a silhouette. A silhouette of Rider. “You should not be here. How is this possible?” Illyn took another step forward, then another. “This is <strong>my</strong> domain. I never invited you here. What variable has allowed this to occur? Nothing unpredictable can happen here, Rider! Answer me!”

Kalki did not. Illyn bit his lip, and then laughed.

“What am I saying? Of course I invited you. In that moment of rage and contempt, I opened the door to my heart.” That command spell, that order. At his weakest, Illyn allowed Kalki into his sanctuary.

“<strong>You did your duty well. We lost to an unseen variable. I was inflexible. You should be resting, and now you’re here. Left to rot with me. Forever.</strong>” Illyn told his Servant.

No response.

“I apologized. I tried to correct my errors. What more do you want?” Illyn took another step forward and shouted, “<strong>SAY SOMETHING!</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114451449221496942 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114451449221496942><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 2:12 AM">2:12 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His shouts echoed through the room, before being swallowed up by the silence. Suddenly, the ground began to rumble, and Illyn and Kalki stumbled with it. Illyn swallowed and narrowed his eyes. This had never happened before. He had absolute control over this space. It was supposed to bend to <strong>his</strong> will.

<strong>Crack!</strong> The ground shattered below Illyn’s feet as several rotting hands clawed at him, binding him to the ground as the earth shattered below him. More and more arms reached around his hands, his neck, his arms, his legs. Illyn screamed a horrible sound of fear and confusion. This wasn’t supposed to happen. This was an unpredicted outcome.

“<em>Ack… No…</em>” Illyn choked out as the ground continued to crack around him as he sunk deeper and deeper into the earth. Full bodies crawled out of the ground like zombies, causing Illyn to release a gurgled scream. He <em>knew</em> these people.

These zombies—people—were the ones that Illyn killed to keep the secret behind the fight with Berserker. The ones that Illyn led into an alleyway to be shot and fed into—

“<em>Evi…</em>” Illyn gurgled. “<em>Kalki… please.</em>” Yet his Servant did not come to his aid. Illyn glimpsed at his hand. No command spell. He had died. A dead Master did not need command spells to control a Servant. A dead Master needed nothing but the hell of his own creation.

The floor broke apart and collapsed, causing Illyn and his victims to fall down into a chasm.

“<em><strong>KALKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!</strong></em>” Illyn screamed as he fell into the abyss.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114451511687262208 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114451511687262208><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 2:12 AM">2:12 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His body slammed against sharp edges of the crevice as he fell.

No!</em>

<em>Fool, you’re already dead.</em>

He saw the opening of the cavern below. It glowed with a dull red light. He needed to grab something. He needed to grab <em>anything</em>. He wasn’t ready to go yet. He had more to accomplish. The afterlife could burn him down to ash after his goal was accomplished. He would burn for eternity if he could spend just one more <strong>second</strong> with her.

His fingernails snapped and broke and bled as he fell into the abyss. Anything. He needed to grab <em>something</em>. He should’ve been able to calculate this, but his mind was running wild. Just as he was about to fall into the cavern below, Illyn grabbed a ledge. It was barely a fingerhold. It was basically a finger<em>nail</em>hold, but it would suffice. Illyn looked down into the abyss, and felt his soul shiver.

“It’s… my dream.” He murmured. Down in the pit was a plain of various objects. Firearms, construction materials, bullets, plants from Alice’s magecraft, and an infinite number of items that Illyn had scanned over the years. Mystic Codes he had reproduced, rare metals he had transmuted. All of it was floating in a sea of blood. Wading through that sea of blood were a slew of corpses, moaning and groaning. “No, this is no dream. This is something beyond my ability to calculate.”

Were those his victims? Illyn watched one beat another with a bike lock.

“Theodore?” Illyn recognized the man as one of his final experiments from before the Holy Grail War.

If that was the case, then this was…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Illyn with Assassin’s blade hacked a nameless man apart with the Servant’s weapon.

“<strong>He has lost everything. He is a dud. A failure of a weapon that we toss into the incinerator to reclaim any valuable materials from. Except he never lost anything.

“<strong>I will try again.</strong>”

Suddenly, Illyn felt a tugging sensation as he looked down at all the people he killed and stuffed into IBM. The various copies that had slowly watered down until they accomplished their goals. He would have become like them: a monster trudging forward. Maybe he still was. Yet a value, an error that could not be known, raised him from the abyss.

“<strong>I do not remember all of you.</strong>” Illyn whispered to the corpses as they crawled on top of each other to grasp at him. “I barely remember a few. I don’t even remember my entire life. How could I remember the hundreds of people I’ve ended? That weight…”

Several lunged onto his legs. Several Illyns howled after him. “<strong>But that’s fine! That is sufficient!</strong>” Illyn growled as he crawled up despite the weight. “<strong>I’ll carry every sin. Every variable. Your deaths were unpredictable, born of my impudence.

&#39;Good morning,&#39; he greeted Illyn, sounding like a kid who had yet to go through puberty. Rider lowered himself into a cross-legged position, balancing a mug filled with what appeared to be thick black sludge on his lap. &#39;You slept like a baby.&#39;

I need to think. I&#39;m processing information.&quot;

A few moments of awkward silence passed as Illyn went through everything that happened before his &#39;death&#39;. He assumed that Kalki had defeated Assassin, as they were here now. This was going according to plan. By sacrificing himself and reviving himself with IBM, they had gotten the advantage.

So they had won. Right? Illyn&#39;s thoughts were jumbled still, and even with three rooms and accelerated thinking, it was no easy feat to return from death. Especially since he had so much more to work with, now.

&quot;Is it actually morning, or are you saying &#39;good morning&#39; as a response to me waking up? My internal clock is shot.&quot; Illyn rubbed his eyes as he scanned the overflowing garbage. &quot;You made a mess. Disgusting. I told you to clean up after yourself.&quot;

If he was surprised by Kalki&#39;s new voice, he didn&#39;t show it. It was extremely familiar, though. Illyn blinked and cocked his head. &quot;That voice isn&#39;t new. I heard it from a child, once. It&#39;s from... processing...&quot;

Illyn rubbed his eyes again, and met the flickering red gaze.

&quot;Kalki.&quot; That feeling of deja vu was back, crawling through his eyes. He recognized the voice, but <em>beyond</em> that. He had a feeling that this went deeper than basic surface level mimicry.

Technically morning.&#39; Rider chimed in with a smile. He seemed to be rather fond of smiling. Illyn couldn&#39;t recall the last time he had seen such a carefree expression on his Servant&#39;s face.

So carefree, in fact, that Rider seemed to have disregarded Illyn&#39;s choice words about his apparent sloppiness, almost as if they did not pertain to him. His eyes never left the magus; his smile only grew wider as Illyn tried to gather his thoughts.

&#39;You never came to play,&#39; he said cheerfully, rocking back and forth in his seat and completely shattering Kalki&#39;s dignified image in the process. &#39;So, I came to find you.&#39;

He pressed the mug of dark sludge into Illyn&#39;s hands, nearly scalding his fingers with its heat. &#39;A complimentary drink,&#39; he suggested helpfully, referring to the dubious substance in the mug. It was so thick that no steam rose from it.

&#39;I don&#39;t want it anymore.&#39; Ah, so that&#39;s why he handed it over...

&#39;After all, you are awake now.&#39; Rider tightened his grip on Illyn&#39;s hands, this time almost causing them to break. &#39;Did you have a good dream, Mr. Mariston?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115158359339966515 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115158359339966515><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 5, 2023 1:01 AM">1:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He felt pain as he picked up the mug from Kalki. The surprise of it made him want to hiss and screech. Before his revival, Illyn had lived a subdued existence. He tasted little, he felt little, he embraced little. It was a nonlife that existed due to there being little Illyn left to copy.

With more of the schematic that was &#39;Illyn B. Mariston&#39; currently active, that came with added sensations. One of them was pain. It also brought an acute sense of thinking. He felt <em>clearer</em>, more driven, more alert.

More capable.

Therefore, he did not let go of the sludge. He took a sniff of it, and the sensation of smell made him want to cry. It smelled awful. It smelled so awful that it made him feel <strong>so</strong> alive. He reveled in the sensation, before shelving it. Back to the matter at hand.

&quot;Back to play?&quot; Illyn inclined his head at Rider&#39;s strange movement. Quickly, his eyes fluttered and he jolted the drink in his hands. &quot;<strong>I recognize you.</strong>&quot; A proclamation supported by an even tone of voice. 

&quot;Holy Grail Wars do not let me get away to play, you understand. A few weeks ago, I think I was incapable of understanding the notion of playing. It&#39;s a strange sensation. Before, there were <em>concepts</em> that I could acknowledge but not understand. Now that I have that information at my fingertips...&quot; Illyn breathed out.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115183749978665040 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115183749978665040><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 5, 2023 2:42 AM">2:42 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;<strong>The world becomes so much clearer.</strong>&quot; The childish demeanor of Kalki meshed with the less mechanical Illyn. He took a sip of Kalki&#39;s drink, and hissed at the taste. The taste! Like the smell, it made him feel so <strong>alive</strong>. &quot;Terrible. This is poorly synthesized. It also confirms my suspicions.&quot;

Kalki&#39;s childish actions made him frown. Was this a game to his Servant? No, this was not his Servant. Whatever mind of Sri Kalki was gone, replaced with...

&quot;Boy, why are you inside my Servant? Is this mental manipulation?&quot; Illyn frowned. &quot;No. No magus could be capable of hijacking a Servant mentally. You would have to be a Lord, or one of the Six Sources. You are neither. Yet you know much.&quot; Illyn trailed off.

<em>I&#39;m thinking. One moment.</em> Illyn tested his mental link with Kalki.

&quot;The dream was unpleasant, but important. It is the next chapter in our chronicle, Rider. The next part of a formula that places me on the level of Euler, Gauss, and Riemann. If a boy like you can hijack my Servant, than that only means one thing.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re one as well. Who are you?</strong>&quot;

Just the thing your body needs.&#39;

He didn&#39;t give away the recipe. There was no need to, anyway; Illyn would likely never want to make it again. And as for Rider himself, with his sense of taste still intact, he wouldn&#39;t have consumed that foul concoction under normal circumstances. And now he no longer needed to, because—

&#39;I&#39;ve got you.&#39; He clasped his hands together. Immediately, Illyn felt his mana being pulled from his body, and dumped into some unseen void. Rider was taking from him again, this time with less restraint.

Riders were known to be mana hungry Servants. However, that hunger usually only manifested when they activated their Noble Phantasms. During their idle state, on the other hand, the mana drain should have been minimal. It <em>should</em> have, and yet...

Illyn clearly felt Rider&#39;s drain. The amount wasn&#39;t significant enough to raise concern, but it wasn&#39;t negligible either. Of course, Rider showed no sign of hesitation, behaving just like a kid who didn&#39;t know when to stop unless being told to.

And just like a kid, a sly grin spread across his face as Illyn confronted him about his identity. He had been caught red-handed, but instead of remorse, it only seemed to make him more excited.

&#39;I didn&#39;t <em>hijack</em> your Servant.&#39; He educated Illyn, wagging his finger playfully. &#39;Sri Kalki was already fading away when I found him. If I hadn&#39;t intervened and cobbled his Saint Graph back together, this body of his would have returned to the Throne and left you without a Servant. And by doing so...&#39; He tilted his head and paused briefly, as if listening to an unheard conversation.

Then his eyes brightened, and he beamed with a knowing smile.

<em>&lt;I <strong>became</strong> your Servant.&gt;</em> He declared via the telepathic link between him and Illyn. It seemed that he had intercepted Illyn&#39;s message, and passed the test with flying colors.

I believe you&#39;ll find them unchanged from where Kalki left them. And as for my true identity, well...&#39;

He lowered himself to meet Illyn&#39;s gaze, searching with his eyes.

<strong>&#39;You don&#39;t know?&#39;</strong> He asked, not teasingly but genuinely curious. &#39;Then, why not see me as your guarantee to the Grail? All you have to do is trust me completely. Set common sense aside, heed my guidance, and together we&#39;ll emerge victorious. Everything will proceed just as you wish.&#39;

It was quite the bold claim. Laughable, even. Must every Servant suffer from illusions of grandeur?

Or perhaps Rider was simply trying to sidestep Illyn&#39;s question.

This is dreadful.&quot;

The faint smell of mango eminated from the cup, as if Rider had simply thrown everything with a caloric count into a blender and had poured it into a cup as soon as it achieved a pourable consistency. Nutritional pastes were efficient. Illyn respected them, but now that he could actively consume food and savor the taste, the man would rather face Assassin again than finish consuming it.

That didn&#39;t mean he wouldn&#39;t <strong>try</strong> though.

&quot;We lost? Assassin lives?&quot; Illyn frowned as Rider&#39;s nonchalance as the Servant sucked at his reserves. For a moment, he was silent as he pondered the implications of this.

&quot;<strong>Unfortunate. Kalki was a failure to the end, then.</strong>&quot; The harshness in his tone shocked Illyn for a moment as he carried on. &quot;<strong>Unexpected variables can only cause negative outcomes. That should include you as well, boy.</strong> Or should I say... Rider.&quot;

As Illyn saw Rider&#39;s parameters in his mind&#39;s eye, it became clear that the boy-Servant was not lying. The only exception was the LUCK stat. He raised an eyebrow at Rider.

&quot;<strong>I could guess, if you want.</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s flat tone smashed through Rider&#39;s sidestepping attempt. This was simply a puzzle that needed to be cracked. A Servant with a hidden identity was unpredictable and unreliable. Rider would say that he was Sri Kalki, but that meant nothing. He was Rider in the same way that Illyn was Illyn.

 Or perhaps Rider was enjoying this whole back and forth, goading his Master along. Illyn shuddered violently as the concoction went down his throat. He continued to vibrate intensely it settled in his gut, where it would cause a mess later on.

It did freeze momentarily, however, when Illyn started theorizing about the creation of the universe, and the presence of God. The sudden shift from the topic of drinks to such profound matters was rather puzzling. However...

<strong>&#39;It is a fine hypothesis,&#39;</strong> Rider entertained back, though his response seemed more courteous than genuinely enthusiastic. &#39;After all, it explains so many things.&#39; His words carried a wry undertone. Was Rider being sarcastic?

But the enigmatic being occupying Rider&#39;s current form chose not to delve deeper into the matter. Instead, he seemed more intrigued by Illyn&#39;s unsuccessful attempt at downing his drink, and his struggle to grapple with his apparent loss. The circumstances surrounding his previous demise at the hands of Assassin remained a blank slate. Rider also wasn&#39;t exactly forthcoming with information, choosing only to answer when asked, or whenever his curiosity was piqued.

At present, his curiosity seemed rather fixated on Illyn&#39;s deductions, which had been delivered in a manner resembling that of an automaton. The magus&#39; demeanor shifted, becoming less like that of an amicable human and more akin to something hovering between humanity and...

&#39;Don&#39;t overclock yourself,&#39; Rider suggested helpfully as he patted Illyn on the head. Once. <em>Twice.</em> His touch was surprisingly, uncharacteristically <em>fluid</em>; it almost felt as if his body was morphing as they spoke.

&#39;Assassin&#39;s time is running out, anyway. In a week, the serial killer known as Herman Webster Mudgett will cease to exist.&#39; He stated matter-of-factly, as if he were already reading it in the headlines rather than speculating. &#39;Whether or not you had interfered would have had no bearing on that course of events.&#39;

Alright. No one was sugarcoating things here, it seemed.

His cheeks reddened slightly for a moment, though his discontent resonated through his bond with Rider.

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Illyn raised an eyebrow at Rider&#39;s confident tone. &quot; Making a prediction was simply part of the academic process. To be sure of it expressed either arrogance or delusion. The war was unpredictable. To be confident of every variable and that they would play out was...

&quot;<strong>Impossible.</strong>&quot; Illyn muttered. &quot;A Noble Phantasm, or a form of clairvoyance? A week? You&#39;re awfully confident. It doesn&#39;t matter, anyway. Assassin will be incapable of moving for a few days, anyway. If your assessment rings true, or if it does not... Irrelevant, either way. Assassins have never lasted long anyway.&quot;

At Rider&#39;s grunt in response to Illyn&#39;s statement on creation, the man smiled.

&quot;<strong>Oh? Do you disagree?</strong>&quot; His smile widened. &quot;I suspect that Rider would&#39;ve disagreed as well. He was awfully fond of his &#39;wheel&#39; after all.&quot;

The concept of God often stirred up strong sentiments, influenced by personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and religious beliefs. It was a simple inquiry seeking to clarify Rider&#39;s stance.

Rider, however, quietly stared. Intelligence flickered in his eyes, but still he took his time before responding.

&#39;God is a term bestowed upon the unexplainable,&#39; he said candidly. &#39;Before the discovery of fire, mankind attributed it to the divine. But as you unraveled the principles of combustion, fire lost its enigma. It became something mundane, controllable—<strong>a phenomenon whose laws you have grasped.</strong> However,&#39;

He leaned in closer to Illyn, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone.

&#39;Despite your progress, countless more laws continue to govern this universe, waiting to be unraveled. Some of you have pulled your weight; scholars like Newton, Lavoisier, and more have sought to uncover and understand these laws. But there still remains a limit—a realm beyond your reach.&#39;

<strong>&#39;That is where God resides.&#39;</strong>

His gaze gradually shifted, settling upon the briefcase in the corner.

&#39;To the items and consciousness contained within IBM, you are their God.&#39; Rider explained, now starting to sound quite delighted. &#39;You have crafted an entire world for them, one whose laws they cannot comprehend. Every occurrence within that realm is at your whimsical command; you possess complete control over every minute detail that unfolds within that box...&#39;

Rider paused, and made a plucking gesture with his hands.

&#39;Let&#39;s say, hypothetically speaking, that you were to remove a blueprint from that briefcase. Would you consider it a <strong>prediction</strong>, implying uncertainty about the outcome, or simply an event <strong>predetermined</strong> by your own design?

Even the fantastical can be used as a tool. The Holy Grail is a defective piece of Magecraft that excites lesser minds. It is an <strong>unpredictable</strong> tool made <strong>predictable</strong> by people who want simple things. We as a species are excellent at during notoriously complex things into something simple, like divine intervention. It is droll and boring. It is unpredictable.&quot;

Rider thought that IBM was its own little world, with Illyn as its god. He did not disagree, but he found that relationship too simple. He was not simply a god of replicated dregs. That briefcase was his everything. His reason for life, his motivations moving forward. He could not imagine an existence without it. 

In that sense, IBM was <strong>his</strong> god, as well.

In that sense, Rider was incorrect. No, that was not true. Rider was correct. It was just that Illyn&#39;s heart swayed back and forth between delusion and reality.

&quot;An astute concept, yet you are not God. That is &#39;God&#39; with a capital G. You&#39;re more of a Hermes, aren&#39;t you? Or would you prefer Vayu? I don&#39;t care either way.&quot;

<em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em> Illyn&#39;s fingers drummed across his arm as he organized his words. Talking had never been his strong suit.

&quot;You define your vision too narrowly. Why must you stop at simply the world? Let us stretch that belief across 94 billion light years of space. &#39;<em>Laws, predictions, observations</em>. Bah.&quot; Illyn spat. &quot;Irrelevant to the human condition. Remove them all. There should exist only what happens before, and what will happen after. Motzkin was deluded. Calude was a fool. There should only exist a <strong>simple deduction of facts</strong>.&quot;

&quot;<strong>So then...</strong>&quot; Illyn spread out his arms.

&quot;<strong>Let&#39;s make this Holy Grail War our briefcase, Rider!</strong>&quot;

Vayu?&#39; A bright laugh. Rider sounded amused. &#39;Well, I suppose that <em>is</em> one way to perceive me! However, if we truly want to be precise, then <em>I</em>&#39;—he pointed to himself, then back at Illyn—&#39;am merely <strong>a product of <em>your</em> creation.</strong>&#39;

His amusement remained unchanged even when Illyn visibly distanced himself.

&#39;It matters not whether you are a magus, a scientist, or a combination of both. I was born from your collective desires. I embody all that you cannot fathom. All the mysteries that remain unsolved, all the knowledge that slips through your fingers—they serve as the foundation that shapes my existence. In essence, I am your personal Wish Granter. And thus, Illyn B. Mariston, it is only <em>natural</em> for you to desire me.&#39;

He pulled Illyn&#39;s hand into a handshake.

&#39;The contract has been established,&#39; he proclaimed, then pulled them both onto their feet. Once again, an elusive fluidity enveloped Illyn&#39;s fingers. &#39;Rest assured, you will get your happily-ever-after. All that I ask...&#39;

A mischievous, childish expression reappeared on Rider&#39;s face.

&#39;...is for you to acquire a new vehicle. Your old car met an untimely demise, but you already expected that when you crashed it into Assassin&#39;s hotel, didn&#39;t you?&#39; He feigned innocence.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117381803435622520 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117381803435622520><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 4:16 AM">4:16 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

After a moment, he frowned. &quot;Wait, did you <strong>not</strong> drive it home?&quot;

He looked into Rider&#39;s childish face, and deflated. They could hardly walk back into Assassin&#39;s headquarters and get his old car. It was dented, anyway. It would draw attention, and worse, <strong>hurt Illyn and Rider&#39;s style.</strong>

That was unacceptable. 

Well, it was. Illyn was a humble man with humble needs. His one valuable posession was that car. To make matters worse, it was a <strong>company</strong> car. It didn&#39;t really matter. All he knew was that if he and Rider failed to win the war, his job would be ruined.

Oh, the horror.

Whether the disgust on Illyn&#39;s face originated from the uncanny handshake of Rider or the prospect of fighting insurance providers was impossible to guess.

As Rider explained his purpose, all Illyn could do was nod. His eyes were alert, and they seemed to know more than they let on. As Rider continued to describe his nature, Illyn&#39;s eyes responded back:

<em>I know.</em>

&quot;And yet that desire appeared to the Holy Church, first.&quot; Illyn inclined his head as he produced IBM. It banged against the floor with a <strong>clang</strong> as Illyn looked around in disgust.

&quot;You will clean up your own messes moving forward. I will do it this once as thanks for saving my life.&quot; Illyn reprimanded his Servant&#39;s childish habits with a scowl. &quot;Not that I will complain. All useful materials must be reclaimed following an experiment. We tidy up, we reuse, we repeat. Understood?&quot;

He quickly stifled it into his palm.

&#39;So many rules,&#39; he commented, but not the least bit irked. &#39;I suppose you&#39;d be much happier if <strong>that man</strong> were here instead of little old me.&#39;

But despite Illyn&#39;s harsh words, Rider seemed happy to be in the present moment. He took the reprimands in stride, not displaying a positive or negative response to the implications in those words, but rather the fact that he had been given a lengthy talking-to.

Rider reveled in that attention.

&#39;Do you envy not being my first choice?&#39; Rider teased. He surrounded Illyn with his presence as he encircled the magus. It wasn&#39;t hard; Kalki was no short man.

&#39;But I knew you wouldn&#39;t mind. I had my reasons too,&#39; he mused, casting a thoughtful gaze at his own palms. &#39;My previous vessel was weak. My options were quite limited. However, that is no longer the case.&#39; A satisfied expression crossed his face as he flexed his hands.

As Illyn set to work, Rider offered his assistance as well...in the form of kicking scattered bits of trash into a smaller, more manageable pile. &#39;We set off in 12 minutes,&#39; he reminded the magus as he &quot;helped&quot;. &#39;A car will arrive at the nearby station for service.

I can&#39;t tell the difference. I&#39;m not much of a social butterfly, see.&quot;

Illyn got along far better with &#39;Rider&#39; than he did with Rider, though that was mainly because Rider&#39;s philosophy made Illyn want to choke the life out of the god. As a mechanical flesh puppet, he loathed it. He utterly despised the wheel-slavering buffoon.

<em>You traded your life for his.</em> A little voice said in the back of his skull.

&quot;Being a first pick is overrated. It is the most unlikely in a set to be the correct answer, it is chosen because it is <em>obvious</em>, not because it is the best choice.&quot; Illyn muttered as he checked his watch. He raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh? What if I wait thirteen?&quot;

Illyn&#39;s mind suddenly flashed with the slew of expensive cars he couldn&#39;t partake with while on the run. He smirked. This was workable.

&quot;I&#39;m excited. A Servant who knows its Master&#39;s taste? A truly interesting sight to behold.&quot;

He pulled back his gaze.

&#39;There is no <em>law</em> governing your choice to wait, of course.&#39; He ribbed Illyn. &#39;I just had a hunch that you wouldn&#39;t settle for anything less than the first. Not the second, or the third, fourth, and fifth pick, regarding this very specific case. Besides—&#39;

Rider abandoned his short-lived cleaning duty and darted up the stairs. 

&#39;—I want to drive a cool car too!&#39; He bubbled with excitement as he threw open the door, flooding the basement with fluorescent lights from the room above. &#39;If I&#39;m going to participate, then I want nothing less than the absolute best!

Ten. Time is irrelevant, anyway.&quot;

Illyn wondered what would happen if he attempted to go against Rider&#39;s prediction. Would Rider himself intervene, or would the universe create a scenario in which he would always arrive as scheduled? It was an interesting hypothesis that he longed to test under better circumstances.

His eyes lit up at the mention of the Ford Aspire. It was a sleek car, and well-rounded. It was one he had always wanted to drive around, next to a Jaguar or Saturn. He presumed that those were choices number two and three. The hood space alone would let him tinker with it to his heart&#39;s content. 

Yes, Illyn Mariston was a <em>car junkie</em>.

Or perhaps he always had been, and had simply forgotten. What else had Illyn forgotten about himself?

&quot;You...&quot; Illyn sputtered as Rider abandoned his cleanup halfway through. &quot;We&#39;re not done. Do you hear me? <strong>We&#39;re not done!</strong>&quot; He quickly stepped up after his Servant. Rider&#39;s Riding seemed to remain intact, and Kalki was an excellent cabdriver. Maybe this iteration would be so soon.

&quot;Does the station in question have an inflatable pyramid on the roof, by any chance?&quot; Illyn raised an eyebrow as he pulled on his gloves, hiding his mobius strip command spell. &quot;With cigarettes that you can buy for about 3&#163;?&quot; 

&quot;And would this station—hypothetically speaking—&quot; Illyn continued, &quot;have a hose that is off by about 7.2 PSI, meaning that it would have difficulty cleaning bird excrement off the windshield, despite charging an exorbant amount for a car wash?&quot;

Or rather, he seemed to have employed a technique called selective hearing.

&#39;We&#39;re not done. We&#39;ve only just begun!&#39; He chimed in, completely misinterpreting Illyn&#39;s intentions as they stepped out of the house. Illyn struggled to keep up with Rider&#39;s pace; it bode ill for the future he envisioned, chasing after his Servant around the house and making sure they cleaned up their mess...

As they passed under the mango tree in the garden, Rider plucked several ripe fruits from the branches.

&#39;Cigarettes for 3 pounds?&#39; He said, then took a huge bite from a mango, skin and all. &#39;I know a better place—a dingy little storefront that&#39;s closed 24/7. The owners won&#39;t be back for a while. Besides, they never actually sell anything they stock, so I say we help ourselves.&#39;

Illyn&#39;s other inquiry got a hearty chuckle from Rider, nearly causing him to spit mango flesh in the magus&#39; face. Rider took another bite.

&#39;Is that your wish?&#39; He asked, chewing slowly. &#39;Because if you really are itching for a hose that&#39;s precisely off by 7.2 PSI, just enough to struggle with cleaning bird poop off the windshield...&#39; 

One by one, Rider proceeded to lick his fingers clean. Then he broke into a wide grin, eyes sparkling in the dim morning light. They shimmered like precious rubies, like the blood that often stained Illyn&#39;s basement. They held a warmth that was both dangerous and enticing, just like those of a...

&#39;Why, you only need to ask.&#39; Rider lightly bonked Illyn on the head with a fresh mango. &#39;Who do you take me for?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117744748841672734 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117744748841672734><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 12, 2023 4:18 AM">4:18 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

As Rider tore into a mango, Illyn frowned but said nothing.

The news of a empty store was something Illyn did <strong>not</strong> know about, and he was aware of much going on within Benerice. If the shop was empty and closed, his fireflies didn&#39;t bother to report back on it.

Yet why would it be closed specifically for the Holy Grail War? Illyn frowned in thought, his eyes alight in thought. After a moment, he smiled.

It was fairly obvious, no?

&quot;This war has become interesting, Rider.&quot; Illyn said as fireflies swirled around them. &quot;Even if &#39;we&#39; have lost once, &#39;we&#39; cannot be killed twice. Nobody can kill demons like us, after all.&quot; Illyn chuckled to himself.

&quot;We&#39;ll have to get serious. Now that I&#39;m awake... <strong>We have won.</strong>&quot;

As he monologued, Rider began licking his fingers, and Illyn made a noise of disgust.

&quot;<strong>God, do you ever stop eating?</strong>&quot;
