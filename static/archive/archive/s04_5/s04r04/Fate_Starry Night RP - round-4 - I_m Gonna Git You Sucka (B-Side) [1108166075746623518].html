Approximately 10% of the crowd was Berenice born, the rest being tourists from overseas or Aswan residents that had taken the boat for a weekend stay. He was mingling with anyone but natives, which meant that there was a non-zero chance of an enemy Master being present there as well.

But he didn&#39;t care. He stopped caring about the war out of spite, for Lachlan had pissed him right off. It still felt surreal, to be forced to carry his Master to safety and be met only with more scorn and derision. That royal brat was still capable of badmouthing him despite the pitiful state he was currently in, with overworked circuits and Roland the lapdog to look after him.

It had to be Roland. After all, Lachlan didn&#39;t seem to trust Bill anymore. He didn&#39;t say it, but his glares and mannerisms made it especially clear. Archer didn&#39;t protest at all, instead fully embracing it. He vividly remembered their conversation just hours before, as Lachlan awoke at 4 in the morning with exerted circuits and a Bill in his face.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108166288716611684 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108166288716611684><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 16, 2023 5:57 PM">5:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;You&#39;re worthless, Bill.&quot;</em>

Those words stung more than a million hornets. They had Archer frothing with rage, hands ready to lunge and strangle at the Dowling brat&#39;s twig of a neck. The word failure and Bill did not coincide, especially within the limits of the Cook gang. He was always the one who would get them out of trouble, and the main reason why Bill Cook had survived for so long.

But it wasn&#39;t always this way: His teachers called him dull. His mother had her own grievances. His &#39;friends&#39; mocked his skin and appearance. His father didn&#39;t exist. All that to create a body of stone, one that not even a bullet could pierce. Insults slid off him like oil and no amount of curses was enough to stop his wrath.

Lachlan was the first to harm him with words along. Mostly because he wasn&#39;t exactly wrong: What had Bill accomplished thus far? He was great at stealing. Pillaging. Having his way with others. But what had he done thus far, in this clash between magnificent heroes of old?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108166355255033916 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108166355255033916><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 16, 2023 5:57 PM">5:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He was but an outlaw, and the limits to his skill were now clearly apparent. Instead of being a reliable weapon, he was more like a large, heavy rock that Lachlan carried on his back. Occasionally deadly, but mostly cumbersome. He showed it even now, where instead of accepting his own faults, he reacted in the only way he could.

Roland was shocked as he saw Cherokee Bill direct a heavy handed <em>slap</em> to his own Master, enough to put Lachlan into a daze. It lasted precisely 1.3 seconds, before the Dowling started screaming in anger as the Command Seals on their neck pulsated, filled with the intent to end Bill&#39;s life in that exact moment. Thankfully, Roland put himself between them, defusing the situation as Bill scoffed and turned around, leaving the room.

<em>&quot;We&#39;re done, you stupid brat. Rot in hell for all I care.&quot;</em>

He never got a reply, instead leaving undisturbed. It only made sense to receive no retaliation, since Lachlan would be even more defenseless without a Servant in his current state. He might as well wait until he was healed up before severing his contract with the unruly Archer.

Or maybe, just like Bill, he too needed room to think. To reflect on his actions and failures.

Bill then spent hours touring Berenice, though one would use that word loosely. He didn&#39;t particularly mingle with the crowd, only limiting himself to wearing a disguise while out. It just wasn&#39;t something common to him, to visit places as a civilian instead of an outlaw. Back then, even with a disguise, it was hard for someone as notorious as Bill to pass off as an innocent passerby. But now, in the modern world, he could finally be himself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108166405561520228 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108166405561520228><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 16, 2023 5:57 PM">5:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He gradually eased into the market, approaching some food stalls and tasting some samples. Roland had given him a small allowance just a week ago, since Bill considered it part of his payment for his &#39;services&#39;. He was glad that he had such foresight, since the American dollar was apparently quite powerful over in Berenice. All the beer and food that he could ever want, right at his fingertips. All he needed to do was take it slow and steady-

-Though, with each drink, he couldn&#39;t help but envision Lachlan&#39;s ugly ass face in his memories. That pained, hateful glare that reminded him of a certain someone.

&quot;Stupid kid.&quot; Bill grumbled, downing another bottle of beer as she shoved shoulders in the crowd, pressing himself through as he attempted to walk away from the stands.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108166465498136606 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108166465498136606><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 16, 2023 5:57 PM">5:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

One step he was free, and another, he had a literal hanger-on to the back end of his shirt.  A moment later: &quot;That&#39;s hardly a kind thing to say,&quot; a high-pitched voice called after him.

Turning to face this hindrance, he found it was someone who looked quite similar to a child - dressed to the nines in touristy kitsch, a baseball cap emblazoned with a certain character labelled as &quot;MICTER MOUSE&quot; upon her head, and a dumb smile on her face - but there was something off.  

Obviously, the concentration and continual extrusion of mana left no ambiguity towards her identity.  This girl was a Servant, and she wasn&#39;t trying to hide it this time.

As she clung to him, she tugged at him once or twice more, acting the part of an indignant child well.

Standing in the afternoon heat and surrounded by hundreds was little excuse, he still had let an enemy Servant get close enough to him to touch his clothes!  She made no attempt to attack him, though this could be brushed aside as not wanting to draw attention to their secret war - and still, she clung to him, leaving him in a bit of a literal bind.  Her voice was clear over the din of many Arabic voices, and she made no attempt to actually sound offended.  &quot;Saying such uncouth things about the children on these streets makes you about as mature as they are!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Usually he&#39;d get a light kick from it by now, but his status as a Servant had even affected his gut. Getting drunk in your sorrows was no longer something that came easy, most likely a side effect caused by innate Magic or Poison Resistance that was commonly attributed to Archers. 

<em>&quot;Can&#39;t even have a good drink in this shithole.&quot;</em> He snarled to himself, making up for the lack of tipsiness with a small dose of rage. He was like an unlit powder keg, ready to blow a fuse at the slightest provocation.

And he had found it.

He felt an incessant tugging at his shirt, holding him in place as he was surrounded on all sides by a thick crowd. He could easily break free, but the pulling was constant and on purpose, filling him with both annoyance and curiosity. It wasn&#39;t until a high-pitched shrill filled his ears that he finally gave in and took a look. Behind him was short woman with tacky, touristy attire that you could get at the nearest corner shop for the price of dirt. Her stature made her look like a child, and if it wasn&#39;t for the strong aroma of mana in the air, he might have even believed that.

He stared at Assassin&#39;s lazy grin in confusion, observing the little girl tug at him repeatedly like a spoiled brat. They were a Servant, no doubt, and he had been caught off guard. He wasn&#39;t dead yet and she wasn&#39;t trying to make a move.

What was she even doing? Judging his sorrows and mocking his words, apparently.

<em>&quot;Just what I needed. A fucking Servant.&quot;</em> Bill grit his teeth, grinding them like a handsaw while Assassin kept poking and prodding at the man&#39;s abs, clinging at their attention. No doubt she could tell that he was a Servant too, why else would she have singled him out otherwise? That, or she really was just as foolish as she looked. It didn&#39;t really change much for Bill.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108522394710183986 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108522394710183986><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 5:32 PM">5:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Before Triboulet could prod Bill&#39;s six-pack yet again, she was greeted by a slap to the fingers and a gun to the chin. The cold metal scraped at her face, the muzzle being at the perfect angle to shoot a bullet right at her cranium. To further add to the shock, Bill wrapped an arm around her, like a gallant knight shielding a princess from harm!

...Except in this case, he was simply hugging her to get her close and wrapped underneath his coat, hiding away from the eyes of the crowd around them. Servants weren&#39;t invisible, no matter how much they wished they were. A gun would have attracted too much attention, so Bill did the sensible thing and kept them literally under covers.

&quot;They don&#39;t pay me to be kind.&quot; Bill revealed his face, a shade of black surrounded by malicious green eyes. &quot;And I&#39;m not mature, either. I&#39;ve got no qualms blowing your brains  out, right here, right now.&quot; He pressed the gun further up Assassin&#39;s lips, trying to add some bite to that threat.

&quot;Any last words, Servant? Even a Class name would suffice.&quot; He snarled. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Appropriate, given how this lady seemed to exude the energy of an ankle-biter with her existence.

Kept under wraps and held at gunpoint, Assassin looked at the gun with a bit of surprise, but muted given how dire the threat was.  As it was pushed harder into her face, it scrunched her upper lip up in an undignified manner and made her words unclear.

She looked up from the gun, squinting past the sunlight to look at his angry face.  &quot;Othervise you dust risk leaving me an invalidth.  Nod dat thuch is a big change fer me!&quot;

Still keeping at his side, with death imminent and her epitaph already technically delivered, she shrugged.  &quot;Are we really gon&#39; do thith?  I wathn&#39;t ephen shure I wanted to have a fight, I&#39;m quite &#39;out of it&#39;.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that she minded, since she happily kept talking, ignoring the cowboy&#39;s threat and replying in her usual, charming manner. Bill&#39;s finger tapped impatiently, because it was uncommon for him to ever pause when it came to pulling the trigger. Usually he&#39;d let people run their mouth a bit, either to beg for their lives or to curse him from beyond the grave. It didn&#39;t change much, since they ended up dead all the same, but he struggled to remember the last time he had heard the voice of a full blown idiot. This was neither begging nor threatening. They sounded more like...<strong>a clown.</strong>

&quot;I know how to shoot a gun, ya little rat.&quot; Bill snarled at the comments directed towards his aim. No wonder Lachlan looked so irritated whenever he criticized the boy&#39;s gunplay. He then replied by raising his hand, the gun sliding up and meeting Assassin&#39;s nose, before eventually reaching her forehead.

<em>&quot;This good enough for you?&quot;</em> Bill asked in a threatening whisper, wrapping his coat around the two even more. Their faces were now just moments apart, the gun being the only thing separating the two. He stared down Triboulet&#39;s eyes, trying to look for any hint of fear, anger, self-preservation.

Nope. Just a hint of annoyance and a tinge of boredom. Assassin even confirmed this, casually replying to Bill&#39;s threats with the demeanor of a bored child. Either they were confident that they could overpower Bill, or they didn&#39;t care about living or dying.

But it would have been so easy. So easy to pull the trigger and snuff the life of another Servant. Just one less target to think about for the Grail War.

The War.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108850410069958756 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108850410069958756><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 3:15 PM">3:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;...&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, Assassin&#39;s presence reminding him of the spat with Lachlan. They were done, after all. He didn&#39;t want to see that brat&#39;s face ever again, nor did he want to needlessly participate in this ritual if he couldn&#39;t even rely on his own Master. There was no prize to gain in killing an enemy Servant, besides attracting more unwanted attention and depleting his now limited mana reserves. Who could tell when Lachlan would finally pull the plug and end their contract?

Assassin watched the gun leave their forehead, leaving only a small imprint behind as Bill shoved them away, unwrapping his coat and letting the girl leave. They were now back in the crowd, judging by a random passerby stumbling into Triboulet by accident and knocking her cap to the ground. They yelled some curses in Arabic before leaving in a hurry.

&quot;Today&#39;s your lucky day, you little punk. I don&#39;t feel like playing vermin exterminator today, so why don&#39;t you sod off and go back to your Master?&quot; Bill growled like an animal protecting their territory. &quot;Kids shouldn&#39;t walk around unattended, and I&#39;m no babysitter, so piss off.&quot; He added, waving his hands in a shooing off motion. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She bent down to pick it back up, finding it already having been stepped upon by multiple boots.  It now smelled like something more foul than mere dirt, and looking upon the sorry state it was in...she whined.  &quot;ربما أشياء أسوأ&quot;, she added, throwing the soiled hat at the man&#39;s retreating back.

She stepped back to his side right after, shaking the little anger in her little head out, before looking back up at him.  No, she didn&#39;t seem to catch much of the bark that the animal was sending her way, but she did respond with some bite of her own.  &quot;A kid?  No no no, I am an adult.  God saw to my creation personally, and He decided that dung could not be stacked together a single inch higher.  Are you a God-fearing man who would question His design?&quot;  

She dared to step in front of him, though she still backpedaled through the crowd without so much as a single bump of the elbow.  &quot;If you&#39;re no babysitter nor exterminator, then what are you?  A common, uncouth drunk, lacking in grace and culture?  Not very heroic, if you ask me.&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;I&#39;ve also decided that I&#39;ve no mood to kill you, but I am in the mood to improve my mood, regardless your mood, moody boy.&quot;

Now, her hands were stuffed in her pockets, and she looked at him with the same sort of gobsmack-dumb vacancy that a real kid, who might say &#39;What&#39;cha dooooin&#39;?&#39;, would display.  &quot;Pray tell, what&#39;s got you out of murder this fine day?

Of course, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to see them indulge in the conveniences of the modern world either, but the instinct to fight other Servants still remained, for that was their purpose. 

Bill assumed the same, thinking that the short, impish girl would leave him alone after receiving a good scare. Instead, he witnessed a bout of performance art as Triboulet exchanged insults with a nearby passerby, before tossing hats and rude gestures to further seal the deal. It took her a while to finally look back to Bill, who was left dumbfounded: How was this Servant still <em>alive?</em> Their lack of common sense would have gotten them killed back in his day.

Then she got closer, annoying him even further as she invaded his personal space. He stepped backward, feeling prickly like a hedgehog. &quot;None of yer business what I am, freak. I&#39;d rather you try to kill me than ask questions. Then at least I&#39;d have no excuses.&quot; 

He growled like a beast on a leash, putting his hand on his pistol. Part of him started to second guess himself. Maybe this Servant should die, just to put a lid on any future problems. Or maybe-

-His thoughts were interrupted by Assassin taking an even more childish gaze, scouting him from head to toe like a little girl who had never seen a cowboy before. Most kids back in the day used to run away from him in fright, so to witness something like this left him feeling confused. It quickly returned to grouchiness as the Servant quizzed him.

&quot;What did I just say? <em>None of yer business.</em> Hmph.&quot; He scoffed, then proceeded to kick sand in Assassin&#39;s face before turning around, like a dog cleaning up poop.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109205197831540778 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109205197831540778><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 2:45 PM">2:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;You should be counting your blessings that I&#39;m in a good enough mood to let you go.&quot; He glanced back. &quot;Now, don&#39;t waste my time. I&#39;m done with this Grail War shit, and I definitely don&#39;t plan on spending the rest of my hours with some ten dollar whore.&quot; He snarled, taking out a bottle from his coat pocket and cracking it open.

<em>glug glug glug</em>

He drank with his mouth wide open, lips far away from the bottle as the beer rained down on him like a fountain. So sloppy he was that droplets started falling on part of his knee, but he didn&#39;t give a damn. The smell of Egyptian booze filled the air as Bill now reeked of it. He sighed, feeling relieved for about five seconds before dropping the bottle on the ground.

&quot;I dunno what you&#39;re playing at, but if you just wanted to get a cheap shot at me, well, no fucking point now is there?&quot; Bill said with a slight tipsiness to his voice, though Archer parameters prevented him from getting drunk, much to his disappointment. &quot;Shoo off. I&#39;m no puppet on a string. Tired of y&#39;all wars and games.&quot; He spat, clearly referring to the Grail War, before smelling something fresh in the air. He turned his head and saw that another food stand had just opened, filled with koshary and fuul.

&quot;Ooooo.&quot; He couldn&#39;t hide his focus, soon losing interest in Triboulet as he started shambling towards the source of food like a hungry dog. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wiped away a good deal of it with her hand, and she was nonplussed at him...though, it was more because of his choice to leave her side, rather than his little abuse. 

To herself, she imagined that this was quite a lucky find on her part.  A Servant who&#39;s gone out for himself, done with the war?  Not a second more of subterfuge and violence, only the pleasant experience of modern life all to yourself, with no concerns but what you make.  A rare treasure, even if - just look at the man as he drools from the lip of his bottle - a very well tarnished one.  Triboulet couldn&#39;t imagine what&#39;d make someone drop out of the war like this, just so they could spend their last few days drinking and...

...no, no, that&#39;s it.  Just drinking.  More than dung and human odors, she smelled quite a bit of alcohol, and that was before he started pouring it all over himself.

A new thought formed in Assassin&#39;s head.  In truth, a recent night of delirium and anguish had left her in a similar state, though not as disillusioned.  Wandering, living among the people, trying to understand the modern culture, had brought her the seldom-seen opportunity for <em>peaceful</em> conduct between Servants.  Triboulet wanted to see an earnest dialogue and exchange of thought between two of the greatest and most storied men in history.

Well, it was pretty clear that she wasn&#39;t going to get that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109512682907893900 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109512682907893900><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 11:07 AM">11:07 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>However!

It&#39;d all be pointless given how he was as likely to die as the rest of them, but who cares?  

Triboulet held out a hand and closed her eyes as she finally responded to the soaking wet Archer: &quot;No games have I, but instead, I give thee a golden--HEY&quot;

There he goes, off to the food cart.  Triboulet walked after him, once again tugging on his coat as he ordered food like the pest she was.  &quot;I didn&#39;t know they gave dogs the--well yes, I <em>do</em> know they made Servants of dogs, but that&#39;s not the point!&quot;  Indignant, she pushed around others to stand at his side, mouthing off in front of the uninformed vendor without a care.  &quot;You&#39;ve got the golden chance to experience life as it is now, an ear to listen to your story, and you&#39;re wont to stuff your gullet instead of anything else?

It would have been a nice, relaxing meal...were it not for the little imp incessantly tugging at his coat. 

&quot;What the-PFFT&quot; Bill coughed out, almost choking on his own food as he tried to speak without chewing. He focused back on eating, trying to slap Triboulet away, only for the Assassin to step forward and badmouth the vendor that he had just bought food from. They received a string of curses and shoos as a result, enough for the crowd to take it as a sign to walk past Bill and collect their own orders.

Of course Bill was annoyed. He had only ordered one meal, after all! He tried to push past the line again, only to be cornered by Assassin. &quot;Outta my-<em>cough</em>-way!&quot; He yelled, taking down a deep gulp of food. However, Triboulet would not relent. Instead, she explained exactly why she was so focused on sticking to him like glue. She spoke high and proud, talking about idealistic and hopeful messages that betrayed her tacky appearance. Who knew that a jester could be so inspirational under the right spotlight?

Unfortunately for her, her audience was quite boorish. Bill raised an eyebrow, eating another spoonful of <em>koshari</em> as he seemed to have only half gotten what the petite woman meant.

&quot;Philo-<em>what</em> now? Look, I&#39;m no Caster. Go bother someone else if ya want magic lessons.&quot; Bill spat out, shocking Triboulet even more with his ignorance. &quot;In a day or two I won&#39;t even be here.

&quot;So, I&#39;m just gonna have my fill. Food, drink and women or otherwise.&quot; He explained, taking another bite. Well, that somewhat explained his hedonism. It was true that a Servant would not keep memories of their summoning once they returned to the Throne. Vapid entertainment, as a result, was much more valuable than memories. But was the cowboy truly right in that regard?

&quot;That last part though, I think I&#39;m better off without.&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, clearly referring to Triboulet. &quot;Shoo off, kid. I&#39;m not your type, whatever that is.&quot; He said, about to resume eating his meal, before someone tapped him on the shoulder. A large, burly man with a face resembling the food vendor&#39;s was staring him down.

<em>&quot;My brother tells me you haven&#39;t paid for your meal yet.&quot;</em> They spoke in Arabic, extending an open palm and gesturing for something to come out.

&quot;Ah. Yeah yeah, sure thing buddy. Lemme get it-&quot; Bill reached out for his pocket, feeling for any strands of cash but-

He had ran out. After only a few hours spent in the Berenice markets, he had already run out of the meager allowance that Roland had given him. Granted, he did buy a lot of &#39;equipment&#39; for the graveyard battle, but...

<em>&quot;Shit, I was never good at saving stuff, was I?&quot;</em> He asked himself almost as confirmation. Vague memories filled his head of the several times Bill Cook had to organize the gang&#39;s funds just because of how Bill would mismanage them.

&quot;Uhhhh, just checking buddy. Gimme a minute...&quot; Bill said as the man twiddled their thumbs impatiently. Assassin observed the scene, and while she was no outlaw, she could easily tell when someone was lying through their teeth just to buy some time. Her suspicion turned out to be correct as she saw Bill&#39;s hand slowly reaching for his pistol... <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The remark about women and types didn&#39;t get far past her before she paid it back - &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I would sooner make a groom out of an ass than consider you even the lowest rank of suitor.

Such is less unlikely than you might imagine; strange times we live in, no?&quot;  Though the odds of her ever having a use for that story in her time here were slim indeed, she&#39;d wear her impromptu, one-sided dragon marriage like a badge of honor.

Then, taking a step back as the man&#39;s host arrived with open hands, she watched with disgust at first - <em>&quot;Don&#39;t tell me thy coffers are just as poor as your manners,&quot;</em> she grumbled alongside his hands raiding his own empty pockets - and then with a sudden switch to enthusiasm, as she knew what could be done to ameliorate their situation...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109605656744448020 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109605656744448020><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 5:16 PM">5:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...and then to a very <em>hurried panic</em> as she fished out her own wallet, one of the cheap novelty tourist ones from the back of the store.

Good Lord, protect this humble Servant of yours through the next few hours.

It was actually slapped directly onto the table, loud enough to take attention away from other things, and then she quickly fished out a handful of paper notes.  &quot;Here!&quot;  With cash in the open, she was right back to smiles and a pleasant demeanor: &quot;Forgive him, good sir.

They nodded and shooed her off, not caring for the details of her story.

Of course, Bill was surprised in comparison, wondering why the little imp had bothered to cover for him. &quot;I&#39;m not forgetful, I just thought this shit would be cheaper.&quot; He grumbled, taking notice of how the Assassin was doing her best to throw him under the bus. 

&quot;Whatever. You trying to butter me up or something?&quot; He harrumphed, casting an annoyed glare right back at Triboulet. &quot;Takes more than a fistful of dollars to make me your slave.

His eyes widened, as if saying <em>&#39;Hey!&#39;</em> before pausing himself in the act as the woman kept speaking.

&quot;Do I look like a priest? Maybe go get your eyes checked.&quot; He puffed out hot air as he adjusted his hat. &quot;And money is no issue. I&#39;ve lived without it for weeks.

It was the shuffle of the widow in the streets with meager goods to sell, made out of desperation.  It was the sly smile and weak lip of the broken noble, hands on knees to ask his elders for a spot of usury.  Pride over destitution.  He was right.  Aside from it just being a dumb guess in the first place, never would a hermit try and pretend he had money he didn&#39;t, and never would he be ashamed of that.  All the same...she didn&#39;t have any clue as to what kind of hermit carries a gun.

Trust in God first, and then in God&#39;s iron second.  That kind of hermit.

She leaned forward, crossing her arms and giving him a wry grin.  &quot;How strange that you say that.  It&#39;s the opposite - he&#39;s not keen on seeing me, not for the moment.  Hard to imagine that anyone would be so fearful of a little shit like me, but it&#39;s the truth!  It&#39;s brief, and we&#39;ll be back to the war right after, but this afternoon?  He&#39;s safe, and I&#39;m out trying to have a life.&quot;

A slight lie.  It was her own decision, and...there was no reason to admit it, but her fault, as well.  Perhaps because of this, Bill had seen a miracle - a Triboulet that wasn&#39;t dedicated, mind body and soul, to being as loathsome of a creature as she could be.

&quot;A life I shall have!  And, I shall give you one too.&quot;  This, in certain contexts, could be interpreted very badly, but she held out a wad of money in front of him like she was soliciting the poor man.  &quot;Do you wish to have as grand a life as you could here, and live these last few days in bliss?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But as a fellow Servant that had split off from his Master, Bill could somewhat relate to Triboulet&#39;s story. If anything, he felt almost envious at the jester&#39;s state of things: It sounded like they had agreed to separate themselves from their Master, at least temporarily. It could have been a spat or a mutual agreement, but the cowboy didn&#39;t care. It was already miles better than his relationship with Lachlan, and that thought drove him mad.

&quot;Well, aren&#39;t you lucky. Must be nice to be a dog without a leash.&quot; Bill said, the irony not lost on Triboulet who could have easily replied in kind. Instead, she waved a stack of bills in front of him like an alluring temptress, almost as if trying to purchase his service. Bill narrowed his eyes at the thought, the role of the &#39;ten dollar whore&#39; having now being completely flipped around its head.

&quot;You fucking-&quot; He wanted to call Assassin a wide variety of unkind things, but refrained with each layer on the stack of bills. &quot;You must have a death wish if you really want me around.&quot; He snarled, baring his fangs like a wolf protecting their territory. His arms leaned for his pistol, as if he was tempted to shoot Assassin down in that moment. Tension filled the air, his gun slowly sliding out of its holster at a glacial pace.

What would Bill gain from murdering Assassin on the spot? There would be one less Servant to deal with, but he wasn&#39;t even participating in the Holy Grail War anymore. Plus, it would attract unwanted attention, meaning that he wouldn&#39;t even get the chance to explore the rest of Berenice&#39;s markets. There was also no telling whether Triboulet was hiding any abilities behind her sleeve, which could make the fight even more problematic for him. He would rather not get in a war of attrition when he wasn&#39;t even sure if he could count on his Master&#39;s mana supply.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109654103660965889 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109654103660965889><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 8:29 PM">8:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
All those reasons were minor compared to the stack of dollar bills in front of him. He counted them by heart, already calculating the amount of things he could potentially buy with them in hand...

His gun returned to his holster as he grabbed Triboulet&#39;s hand by the wrist, his grip forceful and firm. He then started counting down the bills with his spare hand, making sure they were actual dollars at the same time.

&quot;Fine. If you&#39;re gonna offer me a &#39;grand&#39; life like the little whore you are, then why not? You&#39;re paying, of course.&quot; He said with a malicious laugh. &quot;Now, I&#39;m gonna grab some more food-&quot; He said immediately, attempting to pry out the stack of dough from Assassin&#39;s hands.

Just a little bit of mockery wouldn&#39;t hurt!  And, of course, it&#39;s all the more acceptable because the good sir is being paid for his time.  His threats, his ungentlemanly words pushed her to drive the spike in further.  What&#39;s next, a few dollars more to make him call her <em>ma&#39;am?</em>  Perhaps even worse...

...her smile subsided a little as she looked down at the holster and its slowly departing occupant.  This wasn&#39;t out of concern of danger, but more that she had begun to wrestle the notion that being a huge cunt for no reason wasn&#39;t going to get her anywhere in the long term but alone and wandering aimlessly.  If she wanted that, well, she wouldn&#39;t be bothering someone who had plenty of reasons to kill her!

She was prepared to pull away and put the solicitation joke to an end, but by that point, this gunman had changed his mind: her money was good, so good in fact that he apparently just <em>had</em> to have it held up to stare at!  It wasn&#39;t a princely sum, not enough to make money a mere object...but with how cheap food is here, even in tourist-trap Berenice, one could presumably live off of it for the remainder of the month (provided they didn&#39;t just spend all day eating blindly).

...forgive her, but just one last bit of teasing: &quot;Sir, I cannot tell if you&#39;re eager, or if your eyesight&#39;s just that shit.&quot;  That&#39;s it, no more, she&#39;s done.

Her temper grew a little more ill.

&quot;You MAY get some more food, but you shall learn to ration the hard way.&quot;  Her other hand pointed at a couple of bills at the end, earmarking them for the food budget.  &quot;We shall feed your gut, and then, we shall feed your soul.

This made him groan, watching as the woman&#39;s eyes looked more like those of a cat toying with prey, causing him to avoid eye contact and instead focus on the stack of bills in front of him. His immediate thoughts were food, but-

&quot;Hey! Hands off-&quot; He protested, but Assassin was particularly insistent, budgeting the money and preventing him from getting away. It would have been easy for him to overpower her, but also equally easy for her to ruin the stack of bills. He was forced to play nice, listening in to Triboulet&#39;s ramblings about things that Bill had never given a single thought to. Philosophy, arts and culture: Things that served no purpose to a cowboy in the West.

&quot;Feed my soul? Bah. Don&#39;t peddle some spiritual shit to me. I already got my hands full with the Great Spirit.&quot; Bill said, referring to a Cherokee deity that Triboulet had most likely not heard of. No wonder he acted like such a heathen.

&quot;What else is there to do for a Servant, really?&quot; Bill asked, feeling like he was repeating himself. &quot;I like cleaning my gun. I like milking cows too. That&#39;s about it.&quot; He crossed his arms, staring back at Assassin&#39;s judgmental glare. He was fully aware that his answer was unsatisfactory, based on how the woman reacted, but who gave a shit! She couldn&#39;t change his tastes.

&quot;There&#39;s also this radio thing that&#39;s in cars. It plays some nice tunes, which beats humming repetitive drivel while I&#39;m on a horse.&quot; He grumbled, as if the latter was something he had experienced many times before, but it seemed to go even beyond that. Assassin&#39;s questioning had caused Bill to remember what he used to do in his spare time while he was still Lachlan&#39;s Servant. Well, not anymore.

&quot;I can&#39;t go back to the hotel now though.&quot; Bill said, almost as if he were at a confessional and saying his thoughts out loud. &quot;So there&#39;s nothing here for me but food and drink. More than enough, I&#39;ll say.&quot; So, that was the diagnosis. A Servant that had experienced shallow things and basic necessities. No wonder they were shambling like a mindless corpse: They had no standards nor taste? Something needed to be done to give them a sense of refinement. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Television?  Triboulet had finally gotten one to work, <em>and</em> it wasn&#39;t destroyed, but what she found on there were plays of people extolling the virtue of items and clothing directly to the audience, and banal dramas that had pitiful actors and terribly convoluted plots (she was not privy to the fact that terrestrial, daytime TV is not considered the high watermark of artistic expression).  

Radio?  She had yet to hear of it, but by her guess, it was a machine that is to music what television is to plays...which is kind of strange, considering a television produces sound as well.  By her estimate, you would think that the visual machine would&#39;ve slain the aural machine in the minds of men by now.

And that was to say nothing about <em>gun care</em> or <em>milking cows.</em>  &quot;Give yourself some due respect.  We are fine people, not mere blacksmiths and milkmaids.  I can only diagnose this, with my title to doctorhood only given by Saint Nitouche himself, as low self esteem - pick up that chin and that gut of yours!&quot;

&quot;What I suggest, to lift your spirits and your mind, will be this: the <em>film.</em>  No, not something that covers you, but instead the greater form of the very same television that you so love!  I&#39;ve also seen what&#39;s to offer on that machine, and it&#39;s tripe.  Tripe, I say!  Now, film, that is where the artistic minds go to.  More effort, more cash, all spent to make a greater product,&quot; she said, already leading him along the streets.  For once she wasn&#39;t trying to get him to follow with pulling and pushing, just a simple beckon.  Had their trust already built to that point?

&quot;I promise you, whatever you watch shall be greater than the enjoyment you got from the television - tenfold!&quot;  What she left out was that she hadn&#39;t actually gone to the movies herself, and was basing all of this on seeing ads during the breaks in programming.  They&#39;ll both get to see it for the first time together; isn&#39;t that nice?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So long as he could find something amusing, he would consider it &#39;enjoyable&#39;, slap his approval sticker on it and let it rot in a corner of his brain. He didn&#39;t even feel insulted when the Assassin started trying to &#39;cheer&#39; him up for talking about his past professions. To him, milking cows and tending to guns was just simple, respectable work.

It was hard to even think of Bill as ambitious, despite his prolific outlaw career. Was he just a demented psychopath who only enjoyed stealing and pillaging? Or could the great Triboulet perhaps change his outlook on life for the better?

Those questions could only be answered through action, which is what Assassin immediately decided on as she proposed their first activity of the day. &quot;Film? So, those moving pictures and stuff?&quot; Bill asked, using the knowledge that he had obtained from the Grail&#39;s summon. &quot;I already saw the TV. What&#39;s so different-&quot; He was about to continue, until Triboulet shut him up with her wise words and standards of quality. Upon explaining to him that TV was nothing more than a fa&#231;ade compared to <em>true</em> film, she took a few steps forward and motioned for him to follow, like a dog with their owner.

&quot;Bah. If you planned on putting me to sleep, you&#39;re doing a great job at it.&quot; Bill grumbled, reluctantly following the woman. Not like he had anything better to do with no money. Plus, to tell the truth, it was somewhat nice to have this impish menace around. The noise she made did a great job at distracting him from his other problems.

Provided Bill didn&#39;t wander off to the other end of the city, already disinterested in whatever she was selling, they&#39;d find their place soon enough.  The crowd thinned at the edge of the market, allowing for more breathing room, more space, and sadly, less wafting odor of frying lamb and cooked lentils dominating their noses.  One could only hope that, on the next morrow, the market would still be there with its bounty...

...but here, they&#39;d find today&#39;s cornucopia.  It wasn&#39;t too far, as the division between &quot;place actual locals live&quot; and &quot;tourist attractions and western comforts&quot; can be as slim as a single block&#39;s walking.  It was a place of bright lights, twisting neon tubes of brilliant color and a dark, obscure interior, but given it was the middle of the day, the line to the ticket booth was none too long.

Three, a movie about the country they warred in, but why was it titled after someone&#39;s mother?  Perhaps a tale of suspense.  Four, who knows?  Someone made a movie about a man who likes cherries, apparently.

&quot;What say you?&quot;  Triboulet stood in front of them, hand on her chin like a philosopher.  &quot;We have time to see but one of these, and even if mankind has progressed far, I can correctly that some people still make trash for the highest stages in the land.&quot;

As she spoke, Bill would smell another strong scent to replace the ones he lost.  Something inside the theater smelled strongly of rich butter...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Gone were the rough market streets and the unrefined crowd that came with. Instead, they were now approaching the more civilized districts, with fast food buildings and refurbished streets, all pointing towards a large building with posters surrounding its sides. There were bright lights, glass doors and a lot of lighter skinned individuals around with sunglasses and disposable cameras.

It was an odd sight. Certainly not what Bill had expected. He had seen similar dressed people on the flight to Berenice and could only assume they were fellow travelers. Maybe Lachlan would have found it amusing if he had tagged along-

Nah. Fuck that little shit. Deserved every bit that was coming to him.

Before Bill could dwell on those thoughts further, Assassin quizzed him on a set of movie posters. He raised his face in disinterest, expecting nothing, only to be bombarded by a wall of colors. Strong poses, zoomed in faces, ominous coloring. It was like staring at multiple landscapes, all with their unique brand and flavor, their messages and themes seeping from the picture&#39;s borders.

Bill was not an artist, nor a poet. He was artistically impaired and would seldom understand why people would spend money on portraits, music or writing. But these movie posters had an effect on him: One evoked fear and mystery in the desert sands, like how he felt in the Cherokee desert. The other made him think of a lifetime adventure, no different than his own feelings as an outlaw.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110007435189567538 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110007435189567538><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 7:53 PM">7:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;This ain&#39;t trash.&quot; Bill immediately replied to Triboulet, much to her surprise. &quot;Someone who knew their stuff made this. I can tell.&quot; He said, sounding like he was trapped in a trance as he stroked the posters with his fingers. He was utterly charmed, though he also looked undecisive. All these posters emanated feelings...but he couldn&#39;t fully relate to them. Sure, there were traces of elements that he found applicable to his life, but nothing that fully spoke to him.

That, and the fact that an overwhelming smell of butter had distracted his focus. Instead of thinking about movies, he was now more concerned with the rich odor that came from downstairs in the theater. 

&quot;Ooo, they frying chicken in there?&quot; He blurted out, jolting away and catching Assassin off guard: Her dog was making a run for it! In just a few seconds, Bill was gone, having descended to the bottom floor where the theater staff sold popcorn and snacks. If she were to pursue him, she would find him waiting in line, like everybody else. However, his attention was surprisingly not focused on the popcorn, but on a rather large movie poster that was embedded on a wall.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110007478915174420 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110007478915174420><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 7:53 PM">7:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="discord_assets/226l20895-bjb27-81A51.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/226l20895-bjb27-81A51.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: 226l20895-bjb27.png (2.29 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110007528982589490 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110007528982589490><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 21, 2023 7:53 PM">7:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It looked old.

Like a child asking for their favorite toy, Bill pointed at the poster. He felt a deep connection to it, down to the main character and their exaggerated pose. He then turned his head and looked back, noticing that Triboulet had descended.

&quot;We&#39;re watching that. Also, buy me those.&quot; He then pointed at the popcorn line. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Truth be told, she had no idea what any of these plays could mean, and there were no clear marks of <em>com&#233;die</em> or <em>trag&#233;die</em> like a proper play, so she was just as blind as to their quality - beyond that the last one was made by someone who couldn&#39;t afford a <em>real</em> poster.

&quot;I believe I shall vote for <em>the Ma-tree,</em> for it shall give a fine look at the place of the blind in society, around their less--oi...&quot;

She walked down after him, not pleased nor surprised that her words were forgotten.  Once again, the nose had overridden the brain - food was the real show here.  Not even that, but by the time she actually reached his side, Bill&#39;s brief attention had found a new roost: SHAFT.

&quot;Shaft?&quot;  She tilted her head.  Unlike the other posters, this one had no pretensions to it.  There was a foreign man in a shiny coat, he was firing a gun, and that&#39;s it!  &quot;What, no mystery, no...no <em>question</em> to it like the others,&quot; she already was a bit less enthusiastic about it, &quot;what draws you to...no, no.  Nevermind.  I have a feeling that&#39;s exactly what draws you to it.&quot;

It probably could be read as an insult, but it was the truth, wasn&#39;t it?  Triboulet didn&#39;t imagine she was going to be watching a work of <em>art,</em> but she&#39;d keep her mind open.

&quot;We have to pay the owners to see films in their house,&quot; she said, preventing popcorn from being bought, &quot;but that can&#39;t be too hard.  Wait here.&quot;
----
The box office vendor leaned forward so he could rest his tired eyes upon Triboulet fully.  &quot;I am sorry girl, but no children for that one.&quot;

&quot;...I am not a mere yearling.  I am <em>very</em> much an adult, my good host.&quot;

Just by how many of them there were, piled up like a confectionary Tower of Babel, her head was obscured from Bill&#39;s view.  Every step, she had to balance to keep it from toppling.

This didn&#39;t stop Triboulet from describing her own criticisms with Bill&#39;s choice, with made him roll eyes as a result.

&quot;What do you mean you have a <em>feeling</em> on what draws me to it? The hell do you-HEY! Get back here-&quot; He shouted, but it was too late. Triboulet had conveniently turned &#39;obedient&#39;, speeding for the popcorn line like a model citizen. Unless Bill raised his voice (which would cause a scene no doubt), then he&#39;d best remain quiet and patiently wait for his sugar mommy to come back.

The outlaw crossed his arms, tapping his shoes impatiently as he stared at the gigantic poster. He felt a strong warmth coming from it, filled with the author&#39;s blood, sweat and tears. There was passion everywhere around him, from the main character&#39;s dynamic pose, to the eye-catching lettering and gunfire. A great, bombastic flick that was sure to wow anyone who saw it.

No. That was just grasping the movie at a surface level. There was something about the movie that enthralled Bill deeply. Something familiar and close to his heart, a unique connection that couldn&#39;t be shared by others, not even people as &#39;refined&#39; as Triboulet. Was this what it meant to appreciate an art-

<em>&quot;...do something useful with those raggedy hands of yours, and carry some of this burden.&quot;</em>

And then the pest returned, albeit filled with goodies this time around. If Assassin were always so obedient, then Bill wouldn&#39;t mind her company at all. He could smell the sweet, buttery aroma of the popcorn along with the fruity odor that accompanied the mountain of flavored sweets in Triboulet&#39;s arms.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110357640590135378 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110357640590135378><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 7:04 PM">7:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Really? You seem to be doing a pretty job at it yourself?&quot; Bill taunted, grabbing a popcorn cup and nothing else like the vile villain that he was. He took a bite and his eyes widened, overwhelmed by the taste of the popped corn slathered in salt and butter. Such a simple yet effective recipe, not to mention trashy enough to appeal to his palate. He kept eating handfuls of popcorn, before quickly realizing that instead of devouring a whole bunch at once, he could instead toss them into his mouth one by one. Just like flipping a coin.

<em>chomp</em>

&quot;Ahhhh, tight, tight, tight!&quot; Bill exclaimed in delight. &quot;That&#39;s some good stuff right there. Have you tried it yet?! C&#39;mon, eat up!&quot; While Bill&#39;s food review was already getting on Triboulet&#39;s nerves (those skinny arms could just barely hold on!), what happened next confounded her even more. The Archer, who hadn&#39;t shown any sign of care or altruism in the past hour, had suddenly decided to feed her a fistful of popcorn. Quite forcefully, she might add, his greasy hand covering her mouth and stuffing her with junk food.

The taste was overwhelming: Greasy, mass produced, overly salty and a taste bud killer. The kind that only gutter trash would have enjoyed. Then why did it taste surprisingly good, despite how awful its ingredients were? A conundrum, indeed, much like Bill&#39;s actions.

&quot;How is it? Tastes good, doesn&#39;t it? Heheheheh.&quot; Bill started chuckling, his laughter sounding more like the hooting of a ferocious rooster, to the point Assassin couldn&#39;t tell if the Archer was mocking her or sincerely waiting for her approval. It stopped as soon as it came though, Bill finally taking notice of the rest of the food tower about to collapse on Assassin.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110357713025761300 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110357713025761300><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 7:05 PM">7:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Holy Spirit, how weak are you?!&quot; He scolded her, quickly placing his popcorn on the floor as he grabbed any of the snacks that were teetering over the edge. He was now carrying two thirds of what Triboulet had bought, while Assassin was now finally visible due to all the extra fat in her hands having left.

&quot;This is enough to feed a whole gang. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve used all our money up?&quot; Bill cast a suspicious glance back to his companion. Ironic and hypocritical, considering what he had spent his own money on just moments earlier. He was quick to ignore that, however, once he took another look at the SHAFT poster behind them.

&quot;So, how do we watch it? The movie?&quot; He pointed. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

One handful, two handfuls, would a hundred be enough?  The film wasn&#39;t even on yet.  The truth is that she was managing well enough, carrying all of this is not much of an issue with her sense of balance, but she&#39;d like to see where she was going.  Is that too much to ask?  Just a little vision?

&quot;Keep at it and you&#39;ll find even a Servant can choke to death.&quot;  She leered from around the pile, sticking her head out.  Whether this was suffocating on kernels or by her own hand, she had yet to find out.  As his rave review continued, she closed her eyes and turned up her nose to his offer.

&quot;No, I&#39;ve not.  I&#39;ll wait &#39;til we--GHRK&quot;

Suddenly met with her own opportunity to choke to death and be free from this world, Triboulet was properly fed!  Kernels dropped from her mouth and his hand, running down to the slightly sticky black-and-dayglo carpet where they&#39;d make some theater worker&#39;s day worse, but the majority was welcomed into her mouth whether she liked it or not.  She was gobsmacked, and the force of her feeding made it difficult to keep the candy tower upright, but balancing herself on one leg miraculously stopped it from crumbling.  Let no one doubt God&#39;s benediction, especially if it&#39;s there solely to make His flock look dumb.

She barked back at him, something like &quot;Mhrgh mghugn mhmhp muhgh mh!&quot;, but that was just it.  She grumbled, finally planted both feet back on the ground, and chewed through the blockage.

...Hmm.

Garbage - in the sense of an experience with nothing special to offer, and easily replaceable.  Triboulet had dined on the same wine and fricass&#233;e as the King, and her refined/hoity-toity palette found nothing desireable here.  Gullet-filler, the kind of thing you&#39;d feet a cow to make it nice and fat.  Trash.  Forgetabble.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110665615481516183 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110665615481516183><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 3:28 PM">3:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Why was she sneaking another few pieces then?  Surely, to give it a fair shake and then discard it as trash, never to be eaten again.  Surely.  Likewise, she didn&#39;t give Bill her opinion, surely so that she didn&#39;t break his heart.  Instead, she said, &quot;You&#39;ve got an infectious laugh - the kind that gets whole villages blocked off and burnt down to keep it away.&quot;  Very kind, thank you.

Once allowed to see the world with ease, and most of her candy hoard in Bill&#39;s hands - Reese&#39;s Pieces, Skittles, chocolate of local and foreign varieties, jelly beans, things labelled as &#39;DANGEROUSLY Sour&#39;, and just about everything else with a diabetes-inducing level of sugar inside - she shook her head.  &quot;No, our coin&#39;s still good.  Blame your misfortune on your little pissant of a Master, whoever they are, for not giving you as much as I.&quot;  Had to rub it in a little, of course.  &quot;Besides, pigs live in herds.  You&#39;d feel right lonely if it weren&#39;t for a fellow hog to keep you company, so consider it charity.&quot;

The truth was, candy of good make was rare in her time and she loved it so...and now, seeing the future&#39;s bounty of sweets arrayed right in front of her face when she went to get the popcorn, she impulse bought at complete random.  The budget of this impromptu trip had taken a serious hit, but Bill would surely understand the need to keep noses out of your finances.

Now, she walked away from the lobby and toward the darkened halls in the back - the names of today&#39;s films displayed in lights above each door, with SHAFT at the very back.  &quot;Well surely, we walk in, and we wait for them to turn the television on,&quot; she said.  &quot;They&#39;re waiting for the theater to fill, as with any production.  Then, it begins.  Not too difficult to keep track of.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110665740035563704 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110665740035563704><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 3:29 PM">3:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Inside was a &#39;television&#39; alright, but one of a scale orders of magnitude larger than the CRT screen she was imagining it&#39;d display on.  It made sense, but she was briefly taken aback by it.  Not only that, but at first, she imagined the two of them late: the film had already started!  Triboulet rushed to find a seat, which was quite easy given how few people were in the theater, and landed a spot.  Almost literally landed, as she had ran over far faster than a human should and hopped over the row behind to get front-row seats.  The kind close enough to the screen that you have to tilt your neck back a little bit.

When Bill came, quick or slow, Triboulet had looked up and realized her mistake.  The theater was playing period-appropriate blaxploitation film trailers to precede this one, and when the title card for <em>Sweet Sweetback&#39;s Baadasssss Song</em> came on and promised a 1971 release date, she realized it was merely another advertisement.  Mankind seems to be infatuated with their advertisements now.

&quot;Ah, I was merely ensuring our seats wouldn&#39;t be taken,&quot; she said to him at a proper theater voice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nice of you to notice.&quot; He mocked her in jest as he followed the directions to the SHAFT screen hall. On the way there, they enjoyed a few sweets, which Assassin seemed to be a much bigger fan of. She also mocked him once again, ridiculing his ineptitude with money while also reaffirming how noble of a lady she was to take in the poor stray dog that was Cherokee Bill.

That type of pompous, bratty attitude felt all too familiar. Bill felt tempted to laugh along, but morphed into a frown as it brought back triggering memories. He didn&#39;t show it of course, for Triboulet seemed like the type that enjoyed pushing buttons, even if said buttons included <em>&#39;Piss off an Archer so much that he shoots you to death.&#39;</em>

There it was again. That anger of his that wished to blow up anything that bothered him. It normally didn&#39;t put him off, because he just viewed it as part of his personality. If people couldn&#39;t handle him at his worst, what made them think that they deserved his best?

He had already tried being good. Tried being the best. Anybody born in this world will always try to make at least <em>one</em> good action. After that, comes either crushing disappointment, or a resolve to keep doing good. It was obvious which path Bill had chosen.

Not like Lachlan or this stupid Assassin needed to know that.

Eventually, they reached their destination. A large screen was placed at the end of the wall, while the back was littered with chairs that had numbers and letters attached to them. They looked soft, if a bit filthy from all the trash lying around: Discarded popcorn, sweets and even soda that made the place resemble a pigsty more than anything else. Guess they couldn&#39;t afford cleaners.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110720344039366756 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110720344039366756><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 7:06 PM">7:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;What the hell is all this?&quot; Bill wondered, scratching the back of his head. Unlike Triboulet, he had never witnessed the art of plays or performances. No one was brave enough to perform in the lawless West of old, where a travelling troupe or caravan would have made easy prey to bandits, Bill included.

Which is why it was magical for him to see the screen light up and gigantic words pop up on the screen. The lights went off, shrouding him in complete darkness as the only things he could see now were the images of characters on a black rectangle, imposed on backgrounds that were brimming with color. It was just a recording. It was just real life, except acted and performed in a way that resembled a dream. He watched as Sweet Sweetback killed gang members with his strength and confidence, an act so convincing that he almost thought it was real.

&quot;Holy shit! He&#39;s going to town! Hahahahah, atta&#39; boy!&quot; Bill howled, finding the trailer hilarious, albeit his voice was so loud that the other theater goers couldn&#39;t help but stare at him in disgust. Meanwhile, Triboulet was tasked to be the workhorse (as usual) and found a pair of seats for the two. Bill happily obliged, tossing away any of the trash on his seat over to Assassin&#39;s as he craned his neck forward and planted his feet on the ground. He looked like a child excited for a new toy, unwrapping it with his eyes first as he patiently waited for his parents to give him permission to open it. He couldn&#39;t wait for the movie to start.

It started after four minutes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110720368009826394 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110720368009826394><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 7:06 PM">7:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/Ehg2EaYhoJs">https://youtu.be/Ehg2EaYhoJs</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpE3QwPKvCrExGbFd6IhLuw><div class=chatlog__embed-author>sunnyposts</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehg2EaYhoJs"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Shaft Intro Original</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ehg2EaYhoJs width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110720400255631431 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110720400255631431><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 7:06 PM">7:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A large city. A wide street. Eventually, a massive title card, a premonition of things to come.

And there he was, the main character, Shaft, rising from the subway and entering the city. He walked with swagger and confidence, like blaxploitation heroes from that era of movies, a well that had since then run dry.

But to Bill, this Shaft character felt unique. He didn&#39;t feel or sound like a thug, unlike Sweet Sweetback or Dolomite. There was a noble aura to him, one that felt familiar and warm. The way he assisted others despite his abrasive personality and confident stance. The backing of the soundtrack accentuated this further, as if the Gods themselves were rooting for this man.

<em>&quot;Who&#39;s the black private dick that&#39;s a sex machine to all the chicks?&quot;</em> The movie asked.

<em>&quot;SHAFT!&quot;</em> Bill was sold, nodding along as he followed the narration and agreed with everything it said. This man truly embodied the type of hero he wanted to see on screen. The type of person he could root for and relate to. He felt a strong kinship to this character, like one that he had never felt before.

Archer had never experienced media. He had never experienced fiction. He never found something to attach himself to, to inspire or motivate him artistically. How could he find the time or interest back in the day, where all people knew was farming cattle or grinding away at the Old West?

The movie hit him like a bag of bricks. He was hooked on it like a coyote on meat. He sat on his chair, claws digging at the armrests as he watched the plot unfold with utmost curiosity. The most banal of plot beats and twists felt like modern masterpieces to him. The paper thin motivations of Shaft felt noble and heroic to him. It was pure bias, but there was beauty in that as well. It was the appreciation of art at its finest form.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110720437299720272 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110720437299720272><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 23, 2023 7:06 PM">7:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
There was a reason he loved Shaft so much. He realized it only after around 55 minutes had passed, which was the movie&#39;s half time mark. Most people would think that Cherokee Bill loved the film because it reminded him of his own life, as a bold thug with a heroic side.

No. Bill knew that he was scum. He could never see himself as a hero and felt more like someone suited to play a villain. Shaft, however, reminded him of someone that felt very, very close to him. Someone who he could never let go no matter how many times he tried to. That&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t stop watching.

&quot;Yeaaaaaaahhhhh Shaft! Get in there!&quot; Bill clapped with the intensity of a passionate fan, watching the titular character infiltrate a building and pop people inside of it full of lead. His screaming was getting louder, to the point the audience could barely focus on the film itself... <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, she would get to them if Bill knew how to shut up.  Just going by his laughter, louder and more racous than the most violently drunk man in the Quarter Latin, it was difficult to give a serious critique.  Unlike a real play, though, there was no troupe to interrupt with his childishness...so she did not try and fight it.  Yet.

SHAFT, to Triboulet, was a film meant to titilate and excite and provide little more than that.  That isn&#39;t to say she found nothing of value within; the futuristic setting of New York fascinated her every time street-level shots of the city came up, and the sheer amount of people hiding between glass-and-steel canyons was a sight to behold.  The way people got shot to death looked quite realistic to her gunfamiliar self, though some of them seemed to jump backwards when shot.  Out of fright, perhaps?  She held an appreciation for the admitted charisma of the lead actor, and for the way he chose to portray the character without soliloquoy or outright statement of his thoughts, utilizing the intimate feeling of film well...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110957457641062400 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110957457641062400><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 10:48 AM">10:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Though, like she said, titillation and excitement.  Shaft&#39;s desires, beyond the arrest of the villainous Jonas of the Mafia Company, were of raw animal desire - and this chafed her throughout.  She should&#39;ve caught it when told he was a black private dick that&#39;s a sex machine to all the chicks, but even so she happened to groan out loud when it became clear that more innuendo were inbound into Shaft&#39;s very eventful life.  Shaft was also, to her classically-trained mind, the only character within the film worth a damn.  Pathos was thin, there was little potential for tragedy to be had, and the rest of the actors were of middling quality or worse.  The violence served little point in its narrative beyond justifying its own existence.  It&#39;s almost as if the director intended the movie to be nothing more than <em>entertainment</em> with no thought given towards the high standards of the audience!

Which is to say nothing about her theories about Mr. Buford, the idea of black militarism and the running racial tension that suffuses the film.  She had no idea why the Moors would be up in arms against the Europeans if it wasn&#39;t a matter of Mohammadeism vs. Christianity, that old stand-by of war, and thankfully she would never receive the answer.

Suffice to say, Triboulet could not dig it.

Around that point in current time, with Bill yelling his fucking head off and yet another bout of meaningless gun killing about to occur.  Triboulet sat in her seat, cheek resting on palm as she tried to weather the storm of merriment, but found it all too much by this point.  Sweets, which she had eaten just about as violently as Bill had, couldn&#39;t keep her pacified for much longer.  She slowly turned her eyes to the side, like a grinding wheel about a mill, and gave him a truly cross look.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110957479052980377 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110957479052980377><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 10:48 AM">10:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Archer.

BANG! BANG!</em>

<em>&quot;Aieeee!&quot;</em>

Canned screams and gunfire erupted from the movie, Shaft being victorious in yet another violent altercation with shoddy acting and shoestring budget props. Despite that, Bill was completely engrossed, fist bumping the air at the protagonist&#39;s victory. It was a thrilling experience to someone who had never seen a movie <em>ever</em>, far more substantial than campfire stories or urban legends.

Of course, that didn&#39;t mean that <em>everyone</em> was enjoying it. In particular, a certain jester was resting their cheek on their hand, enduring the painfully predictable 100-minute experience, only to realize that they had barely reached the halfway mark. Snacks were a good distraction, but they were long gone, judging by the candy wrappers scattered across the floor. Bill raising his voice to howl like an evening rooster was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, causing Assassin to turn around and look rather <em>pissed.</em>

Bill stared back, hearing her scathing remarks loud and clear. He looked confused, before feeling the sarcasm dripping from her words and replying in kind. &quot;Yeah, so? I&#39;m enjoying myself. Is this not what you wanted?&quot; He bit back, referring back to the entire reason that Assassin had stuck around with this single-minded Archer. Was enjoying a movie not part of the &#39;philosophical&#39; experiences that Triboulet had in mind? If there was one thing Bill hated more than smartasses, it was snobs. One of the many, <em>many</em> reasons that he barely tolerated Lachlan&#39;s behavior.

&quot;For once you were useful and gave me something actually worth looking at. If anything, you should be proud!&quot; Bill spat out laughing, replying to Triboulet&#39;s sarcasm with petty insults. &quot;And what&#39;s this about calling it <em>tripe?</em> I knew you looked stupid, but I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d play the part so well...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111026912337342465 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111026912337342465><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 3:24 PM">3:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
This was rich coming from him. Was Archer really trying to claim that he had a superior taste for quality than Triboulet, the famed jester with a hundred performances under her belt? He wasn&#39;t aware of her true identity, of course, but the brute&#39;s biased words alone were enough to get any critic&#39;s blood boiling.

&quot;Have you even been <em>watching?!</em> How could you call Shaft boring, when he&#39;s doing his best in such a crapsack world? Man has a gun and doesn&#39;t abuse it: Do you know how rare that is? Fuck, he even stopped himself from filling Buford with lead, &#39;cause that&#39;s just the way Shaft is. A real sensible fella with a good head on his shoulders. How could you <em>not</em> root for him?!?&quot; Bill&#39;s speech went from a passionate dissection to a slow descent into straight up anger as his emotions reached the boiling point. He even stopped watching the movie and directed his full attention to Triboulet&#39;s reactions, noticing her glare and disgust.

He stood up from his seat, towering above her before craning his neck towards her face, his breath and spit almost trickling down her skin. &quot;Well? Speak up, then! You&#39;re telling me this isn&#39;t the best shit you&#39;ve ever seen?!&quot; He looked visibly irritated, which confused Assassin for a moment until she put two and two together.

She was no longer dealing with Archer, but a crazed <em>fan.</em> Someone who loved a piece of media so much that they were willing to die for it and defend it for the rest of their lives from haters and critics alike. The worst type of nerd, and Bill had just embodied it! Perhaps she should slow him down before this became a more...permanent character trait.

Or at least that&#39;s what she would have done if a group of theater staff hadn&#39;t approached them, followed by a man that looked a bit more professionally dressed. If the two took a look around, they would notice angry faces amongst the audience, no doubt having the movie spoiled for them by the antics of the two Servants.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111026931522097152 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111026931522097152><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 24, 2023 3:24 PM">3:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Sorry to interrupt you lovebirds,&quot; The manager spoke, raising an eyebrow at the compromising scene of Bill sticking his face into Triboulet&#39;s. &quot;but this theater belongs to the entire audience. Please understand that there are other people around you who also wish to watch the film.&quot; They said with an annoyed glare, the kind that showed a habit of messing with people who pissed them off. Case in point, they decided to prod further.

&quot;May I also see your tickets, please?&quot; They asked, as if suspecting something.

&quot;Audience?&quot; Bill spoke up, now turning to the manager. Assassin could already start preparing for the worst just from the tone of his voice. &quot;Ya call this an audience?! No one is hollering nor clapping at the spectacle in front of them. I&#39;m just raising the bar because it&#39;s what Shaft deserves!&quot; He shouted with pure passion, before hearing the mention of tickets. He then snapped his fingers.

Her frustration was clear, and the response she received was obvious: &quot;fuck you, I&#39;m having fun&quot;.  Was that really why you were brought here, Bill?  To have fun?  As he mounted his defense, Triboulet&#39;s eyes rolled, light reflecting from the screen and onto her face in the theater&#39;s darkness.  &quot;What I wanted was elevation,&quot; she replied, huffing away with clear contempt for the film in question.  &quot;The only thing this film raises is the bar - of how many men can die in a narrative before versimilitude is strained.  In my time, you were lucky to see ONE death in a play!&quot;

She could feel a headache coming on already, which she wasn&#39;t even sure was possible, and she leaned off her hand and forward into her seat, starting to look like a delinquent rather than a refined person.  &quot;This film contains art in it, for I see things that certainly took effort to make, but it is not art.  I was hoping we&#39;d see a bit of that today.&quot;  She smiled and shook her head, and then she had a short laugh.  &quot;If this thing makes you enjoy yourself, that is grand.  But it is usually better for a gentleman to <em>enjoy himself</em> in his private quarters, rather than for all to see!&quot;

Now, and only now, she had raised her voice to a level inappropriate for a theater setting.  Before she still thought there was some ability to salvage things, and she was hoping sincerely that the film tied itself together in the latter half into something intelligent, but this just wasn&#39;t going to be the case.  Archer didn&#39;t know how to speak quieter than a gunshot, and this film had not a thoughtful or comedic bone in its body.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111421291120050176 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111421291120050176><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 25, 2023 5:31 PM">5:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>However, there was a bump in the road: as he continued with his defense, going from debate to just shy of violence, he did say something interesting.

With how many men died, she felt like Shaft was <em>definitely</em> abusing his gun, but that he was even attempting made it sound like there was some critical fiber in his body.  It could be nurtured and cultivated...

...if only he wasn&#39;t being a right cunt about it.  The man was turning into the kind of play-goer she despised, one who took criticism of their favorite works as an attack on the self, the whole of their being.  Cultivation could wait, she had an ego to cut down.

&quot;I am telling thee, I&#39;ve seen better things with children in the street playing with a stick and calling themselves King Arthur.&quot;  She stood right up as well, but thankfully didn&#39;t block as much of the screen as her friend did.  &quot;I tell you, I am most definitely a fool, but this is not one area where my mind falters!

Triboulet froze mid-angry-ceilingward-fingerpoint, a bit upset at the insinuation that they were &#39;lovebirds&#39;, but quickly had some color drain from her face when the tickets came up.

Bill offered his own retort, and she stepped back to the ground as she mimed searching her pockets for a ticket.  A mere ploy to give herself some time to build a defense, which she needed if she was to win the day...and win the day she would.

&quot;There are none,&quot; she replied to Bill.  Then, walking around him to stand in front of the manager proper, she put her hands on her hips and looked upward.  &quot;Why should we pay for tickets to such a poor, run-down theater?  Not only do you take so long to deal with a problem like us, the experience is so poor - you make us watch films that are decades past their prime, your floors are sticky, the garbage bins need to be cleaned, your staff are inconsiderate and I have yet to use the bathrooms but I am sure they are very unclean!&quot;

It would be some time before the term &#39;Karen&#39; came into the popular consciousness, but Triboulet had unwittingly started to turn into her own dark archetype.

&quot;No, with all these problems, you should be happy we paid for these overpriced confectionaries and let us resume watching the film in peace.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was obvious that a proper court jester would not tolerate such slander when it came to matters of criticism and story quality. Bill was no critic of course, but whenever he saw anger, he found it incredibly easy for him to get angry as well. He just never imagined it would be the result of him wanting to defend a fictional media character.

Fictional. That word felt wrong. To him, Shaft felt very much <em>real.</em> Not like Assassin would ever understand. Should he educate them? His heart and mind screamed no, because he had zero expectations for the little twerp to understand him. The second reason was that they were currently being harassed by the theater staff, who were complaining about Bill&#39;s handsome voice along with Triboulet being a pig in disguise with those manners of hers. Just enough strikes for the manager to get nosy and start questioning them about tickets. Did it really matter? They were already inside.

Bill asked anyway, just out of cordiality, only to see the incompetent jester fiddle through her pockets and come up short. She could hear him mumble repeatedly, something about her being useless. That was apparently enough to make her take action, as she put herself between him and the manager, yapping on about how the movie was crap, the theater was bollocks and the service was atrocious. All to say that Assassin should be <em>paid</em> to attend this rundown theater.

Even Archer could tell that it was a lie. A blatant one at that, since he noticed her open pockets being devoid of anything. No suspicious strips of paper on the floor either, just candy wrapper and popcorn nuggets. It was obvious that the little devil hadn&#39;t bought any tickets and had now roped Bill into potentially trespassing. Just when the movie was getting good too...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113185650133454868 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113185650133454868><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 30, 2023 2:22 PM">2:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He instinctively reached for his gun. It would have been easy to shoot down the staff in a single volley, causing the entire public to scramble and potentially even cause Assassin to leave in fear. That would be all he needed to finish SHAFT in peace.

But his hand trembled. Part of him second guessed himself, especially after the film. It was so easy to be bad. So easy to detach yourself from responsibilities and savor only the now. That&#39;s why he could never see himself as a protagonist like Shaft. That&#39;s why he could never hope to match his <strong>dad</strong>.

Was that really the life he wanted? He had followed it doggedly for two whole years. The free life of an outlaw, without chains nor bindings. Why did he suddenly crave bindings then? Why did he always like being the one the members of the Cook gang looked up to? He always imagined himself as a shiny, well-greased gun with six full bullets and a zero percent chance of jamming. A weapon so reliable that you could sleep with it. A weapon that would never betray you, nor abandon you while you aren&#39;t looking.

The furthest thing away from a fair-weather friend. Someone who would stick with you through thick and thin.

He had already failed at that in life. Why fail at it again, when the stakes were so low? If he was a Servant, he might as well have some fun with it. Why not have some fun playing &#39;hero&#39;?

&quot;I believe she&#39;s right.&quot; Bill&#39;s voice boomed in the theater, the tall and shadowy figure trouncing the manager&#39;s imposing presence. Triboulet was used to the savage&#39;s voice, but what caught her off guard was the man&#39;s greasy, leathery gloves wrapped around her neck and shoulders. Even worse, the touch was delicate and tender, which greatly confused her.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113185698883838052 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113185698883838052><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 30, 2023 2:22 PM">2:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;My daughter</strong> was very, <em>very</em> excited for this movie. Yet y&#39;all motherfuckers are treating her like a two-bit criminal. I got me tickets in my car, with our names on it. We simply forgot, yet y&#39;all accusing us of being thieves just &#39;cause of a lil&#39; noise?!&quot; Assassin couldn&#39;t believe her ears. Bill&#39;s voice had gone from slimy and vile to a loud trombone, deliberately puffing out his chest to appear more imposing and strengthen his voice. He probably thought it sounded cool, but it was nothing but a piss poor Shaft imitation, that&#39;s what! Even more embarrassing was him referring to her as his daughter. They didn&#39;t even look alike! What was he thinking?!

&quot;Be honest,&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, staring down at the power tripping manager. <strong>&quot;it&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m black, isn&#39;t it?</strong> Goddamn, I didn&#39;t know you Egyptians had a problem as well.&quot; He said with utter contempt, as if holding himself back from saying worse. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t going to put hands on a &quot;&quot;&quot;customer&#39;s&quot;&quot;&quot; child, but by God, he would get her to go out no matter what.

Entering a theater without a ticket isn&#39;t a right, it is a <strong>crime,</strong> and--&quot;

Before things could get worse, though, Bill spoke up.  The heroic spirit had a bit of heroism within after all, and Triboulet actually started a bit when she heard it - the last person she expected to have that clarion call of a voice was <em>this</em> chump.  Wisely, she shut up and didn&#39;t try to offer anything else.

The next thing he did, of course, was push her around like a misbehaving cat, manhandling with hands covered in butter, and then called her <em>his daughter.</em>  The believability was strained a bit as she visibly resisted his touch, pissed and unwilling to move further, but at the very least he wasn&#39;t undercut by a violent retort of &quot;If I&#39;m your daughter, then I&#39;d like to meet the woman who reared me and slap her across the face for her terrible taste in men!&quot; like she so <em>dearly,</em> desperately wanted to say.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113206961413038110 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113206961413038110><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 30, 2023 3:47 PM">3:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His schpiel got the theater staff to halt in their advance, though at first they didn&#39;t seem very interested in what he had to say.

Even if it was hard to believe there was some kind of relation between the two, the girl hardly seemed an adult, so what else could it be?

Bill&#39;s trump card, though.  That was a masterstroke.  Unlike Triboulet, he <em>definintely</em> managed to pick up something from the film.

The manager held up his hands in defense, and immediately he sputtered - &quot;No sir, no, it&#39;s not--we didn&#39;t mean anything like that!&quot;  He wasn&#39;t even sure if this man <em>was</em> black prior, he could&#39;ve been anything from what he could see past all that hair on his face.  &quot;Look, look,&quot; he immediately moved back in front of them, looking plaintive, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if we caused offense...we just need to see your ticket and have you talk a bit quieter is all...&quot;

&quot;Paw, you said that you wouldn&#39;t be treated this way in Egypt.&quot;  The thought of playing the daughter was sickening internally, but Triboulet was nothing but a consummate actor.  &quot;Why are they being so mean to you?

Psstch.&quot; Bill puffed out hot air at the manager&#39;s response, looking about as pissed off and entitled an angry parent would. He tightened his grip around Triboulet, much to her annoyance, especially once she started playing around to sell the lie even deeper. They had gone from mere viewers to being actors themselves, engaging in a farcical play that made SHAFT look like high art.

Bill looked back, surprised by Triboulet&#39;s convincing acting, but not oblivious to the murderous glare in the woman&#39;s eyes. Mocking those weaker than him filled him with a sick pleasure, though he made sure to not say it out loud to avoid further...drama.

&quot;I did say that, sweetums.&quot; He looked back to Triboulet with a pout, most likely just to annoy her further with his &#39;acting&#39;. He quickly turned it into a scowl when looking back at the manager. &quot;Unfortunately, it looks like racism is <em>everywhere.</em> Y&#39;all don&#39;t deserve my support. I&#39;m leaving, <em>NOW!</em>&quot; He shouted with a booming voice, doing the opposite of what the manager wanted and ruining the experience for even more moviegoers.

Bill shuffled past the staff, keeping Triboulet in front as he forced her to walk forward in a makeshift conga line. The temptation to slap the Archer silly was rising, but Assassin also realized something else: Bill was making a big deal about leaving, puffing out airs and acting in an exaggerated manner. He was also openly flaunting his &#39;daughter&#39;, as if to say <em>&#39;Y&#39;all losing two tickets instead of just one!&#39;</em>.

This term was new to her entirely, and instantly, Triboulet knew how much she <strong>reviled</strong> how diminuitive it made her feel.  There were many more terms of endearment she could&#39;ve thrown back, all of them foul, but she kept quiet - some part of her imagined this was also his way of getting back at her.

This kind of quick push that one does to an unruly child was familiar to the jester and she, similarly, wasn&#39;t pleased about having to be the push-ee instead of the push-er.  Though, an illusion must still be sold: she crossed her arms and whined, looking up as she left the theater.  &quot;But I wanted to see the good sir Shaft win against the baddies, paw...&quot;

The theater staff, for their part, were still at a loss.  One of them stood there dumbstruck and of not much use, the other had already left lest she get pointed at as some kind of aggressor here (though this altercation would probably just bolster her burgeoning dislike of tourists), and the manager followed after them.  He waved his hands about, offering him things like half-price tickets to another show and free popcorn, but Triboulet was quick to retort...

...lest Bill seriously fall for the promise of free food...

...saying, &quot;My father doesn&#39;t do business with <em>racismists.</em>  You can get someone else to take our seats!&quot;  And then, one final touch of civil disobedience, she stuck her tongue out and pulled down an eyelid at the poor man.

Triboulet hadn&#39;t even ever rode in one and she couldn&#39;t imagine how dangerous this bastard would be in a hurling carriage of hard steel.  

The moment she was freed from his caring grasp, she stepped out in front of him and said &quot;First thing&#39;s first: if you do lose this war, you will deserve it for putting me through the humiliation of being a child.  I&#39;m a <em>dwarf,</em> damn it!&quot;  She huffed, crossed her arms again, and let out a quick and all but inaudible <em>&quot;but good thinking with that, itwasquitetheshowyouputon.&quot;</em>

It was hard for Bill to admit it, but Assassin was doing a great job at following his lead, playing perfectly the part of a spoiled child who never got told no.

&quot;Now now, honeypie. They might be <em>worthless sacks of racist filth</em>, but mama always told us to be polite.&quot; He berated, delicately patting Assassin&#39;s head to sell the act further, much to her annoyance. He was about to leave, until the exasperated manager started talking out loud, offering various special deals, apologies and light bows to get back Bill&#39;s favor. Anything to not leave the theater and spread negative word of mouth. But Bill was already on his way out, walking with swagger and confidence at the sight of a job well done: He had managed to defuse the situation not by acting like an outlaw, but by being the &#39;better man&#39;. His chest swelled with pride and he felt incorruptible.

...Though, the offer of a lifetime guarantee (1 year only<em>) of popcorn sounded fairly enticing, but Triboulet, as if sensing Archer&#39;s animal brain coming back to life, was quick to kick her &#39;dad&#39; out and drag him to the theater exit.

&quot;Hey hey now! I wasn&#39;t gunna buy anything anyway.&quot; Bill defended himself, but it would be quite hard for him to convince Assassin on that. Not like she cared, since the two could now drop the act and Triboulet could finally start tearing Bill to shreds as she ranted about the embarrassment she had suffered.

&quot;Ha, Grail War. As if I&#39;d care about that still!&quot; Bill spat out, albeit the thick vein on his forehead already gave away that he *did</em> care about it somewhat. He silently cursed Lachlan in the back of his mind before Assassin snapped him out of it, mostly due to her petulant rants about the act she had to put on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113261840374452264 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113261840374452264><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 30, 2023 7:25 PM">7:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Bahahahah!&quot; Bill started howling. &quot;Ya ask me, I didya a favor. It&#39;s better to be an ugly brat than some short, dwarf woman that nobody would ever love. We called them tramps back in my day!&quot; He hollered, giving Triboulet a new point of view that would feel rather endearing were it not for the backhanded insults that came with. It would make Assassin almost regret giving Bill words of praise, though thankfully she had said them so quietly that Bill barely perceived them.

Instead, he focused on Assassin&#39;s guilt, something that he could easily capitalize on. Unlike a normal person, who would offer Triboulet comfort with honeyed and romantic words such as <em>&#39;Oh no worries, we all mistakes&#39;</em> or <em>&#39;It&#39;s not your fault, I dragged you into this&#39;</em>, Bill proceeded to laugh at her more and flick at her forehead.

&quot;Yeah, good thing you realize you&#39;re a dumb fuckin&#39; idiot. I&#39;m just enjoying a nice little movie and you gotta be all judgmental and what not.&quot; Bill huffed, scratching his head as he tried to remember the barebones details of the movie (besides the fact that Shaft was a bad motherfucker). Unfortunately, due to the movie&#39;s vapid nature and Bill&#39;s own lack of aesthetic appreciation, he couldn&#39;t remember much.

&quot;Fuck! We didn&#39;t even get to see the ending! How am I supposed to cope with that now?&quot; Archer kicked sand around, going from happy to irritated once he realized just what he had missed. &quot;If only ya weren&#39;t so damn <em>loud!&quot;</em> He glared back to Triboulet, who would find the accusation rather ironic, if not downright false. After all, they both knew who started hollering first, although Bill seemed to have quite the forgetful memory.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113261890446032958 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113261890446032958><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 30, 2023 7:25 PM">7:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Couldn&#39;t help yourself to talk about all that <em>bullshit</em> about being <em>cultured</em> or whatever. Do I look like I care what you are?

<em>&quot;Tree-bowl-at?&quot;</em> Bill spoke horribly, butchering Assassin&#39;s fine name and dragging it down several levels lower until it touched the filthy mud at the bottom of the earth. 

&quot;The hell does that mean?

It wasn&#39;t until she revealed the prestigious role that she held in life that Bill had more substantial things to add.

&quot;I never thought clowns could do comedy and art though. I dunno much about artists though.

Trib-bee-lay coasted across the void.  Her soul, wandering with her, found no solace in the everlasting expanse that was left: the hole in her heart that Bill had shot through.  In that moment, she doubted there was a soul standing along with them in these streets that could match her disappointment. 

Couldn&#39;t even spare a &#39;Ah think ah hurd dat one in muh class-ick-cul literchure class&#39;, could you?

She steeled her face, and with what was at stake she had a composure most worthy of being compared to that metal, but the <em>sheer power</em> of just how displeased she was with her notoriety broke through all the same.  The moment after Bill mangled her name at her, all agape with that snaggletooth-piehole of his and staring at her incredulously, some level of light left her eyes.

Had that fame in life meant nothing in death?  Did everyone forget about Le Fevrial?

Still, once the Archer had worked his mental magic and tried to deduce the source of his name, which had already been strung up to a tree and gutted, her reaction was to correct him.  <em>&quot;<strong>Tree-bou-le</strong>.&quot;</em>  Slow, and deliberate, but she tried to keep it from sounding like she was talking down to him.

Sure, comedy brought her torture in the past, but at least this rube got SOMETHING right.

<em>I shot one to death and...that&#39;s about it, I guess.</em>

Triboulet stopped her hopping on the can mid-jaunt.  For a second there, she thought he meant &#39;I shot a clown to death&#39;, which would be...why would you even shoot a clown?  What purpose does it give you?  All it does is make you look like you&#39;re fuming mad.

Picking up right where she left off, she returned to joviality and said &quot;Perhaps I may not be a hero of note to a <em>non-Frenchman,</em> but I assure you, I&#39;m quite important.  You wouldn&#39;t see me if I wasn&#39;t!  Who else has people coming up with stories just because my insults and whatnot were simply that popular?&quot;  

For seemingly no reason other than to flex, she performed a hand-stand on the rim of the trash can, bringing her down to eye level with him.  &quot;But you.  You&#39;re a man of the gun, and a more recent one - that iron arm of yours looks nothing like the flintlocks of my day.  You don&#39;t strike me as a general, and you don&#39;t have the attitude to be a dashing hero.  If you are that important, what have you done to deserve it?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Huh.&quot; Bill scratched his head, incapable of grasping the French pronunciation. To him, it just sounded like mangled English, despite the fact that he could barely read and write in English in the first place. It was like trying to teach a dog: They wouldn&#39;t understand, they would just tilt their head at you and look silly, except Bill was a lot louder and thicker.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;ll just call ya Tribble.</strong> Way easier.&quot; He said with a smile. Not even a mocking one. He looked genuinely impressed with his own genius, as if the name he had christened Assassin with was far better than her original name. This was far worse than her actual, pre-court days name, which was an accomplishment. How did this mongrel keep sounding dumber with every passing second?!

Archer then continued once he heard more details of Tribble&#39;s past. &quot;No shit people thought you were insane. Who the hell would dress up as a clown?&quot; He asked in disbelief, before seeing sparkles in Assassin&#39;s eyes as she felt proud that Bill had recognized her profession, to the point she started flaunting about her role, her appearance and everything attached to it.

&quot;See? That&#39;s proper insane talk. Guess ya weren&#39;t kidding about being a weirdo.&quot; He said bluntly with a slight chuckle, watching Tribble assume various poses before she settled on one and stared at him in the eyes. Now it was her who started prodding him with questions, albeit Bill didn&#39;t seem fazed at all.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m important, ya midget! I&#39;m an outlaw. Worst one in the West!&quot; Bill gloated. Of course, the West held a very different connotation to Tribble, one of France, Spain, maybe even the accursed England. She didn&#39;t realize how small (or perhaps big) Bill&#39;s West truly was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113940700896165938 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113940700896165938><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 4:22 PM">4:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;They called me <strong>Cherokee Bill.</strong> I&#39;m the terror of the desert. I robbed, pillaged and stole! I shot, killed and maimed! I made kids cry and women too! Y&#39;all were praying to God the day I died!&quot; He laughed, seeing that last bit as worthy of praise. After all, how many men could claim that their death put everybody at ease? Even more peculiar was Bill&#39;s name. It was so...plain. Especially plain compared to Triboulet. Yet Bill didn&#39;t seem to mind, if anything he looked quite proud of his simple, dull name.

&quot;And that&#39;s about it.&quot; He said, which shocked Tribble. That was barely an introduction! All he did was boast about horrid deeds, yet look at him now, hands on waist as he assumed a confident, domineering pose. 

&quot;So yeah, you&#39;re pretty screwed to have met me. Good thing I&#39;m out of this whole Grail War bullshit, otherwise you&#39;d prolly be dead!&quot; He laughed. &quot;I ain&#39;t no Shaft, but I&#39;m pretty confident in my chances.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even those birds, who don&#39;t have anything going for them besides shitting and eating seeds, could repeat my name back to me.  Do you want to read my lips?  Come over here, monsieur, and read my fist - maybe the heat from your brain rattling about will make it run better, as it&#39;s clearly not been used in some time!  And, of course, &#39;tis not even a GOOD misappropriation of my name.  It sounds as a baby&#39;s random babbling to my ears.

Get down on your knees and lick his foot like a dog and, well, looking at your face, he&#39;d believe you were one!  Maybe you and that other dog could go have a few hours to yourselves, that&#39;d be more entertaining than finding a forlorn street corner to piss in!  You idiotic shit-head!  Take that gun and end yourself!</em>

&quot;...compromise I can live with.&quot;

There was a great temptation.  Such a master at her craft she was, that this sort of bile came forth from her mind without the slightest prompting...and it took a much greater effort to keep herself from spewing it out when it came around.  Unlike other instances, she could tell that Bill meant well...somehow...and she was willing to let it slide.

At least it would be consistent.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1113966659858874388 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1113966659858874388><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 1, 2023 6:05 PM">6:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>His notion that a clown has to be insane, and the insane tend to be clowns, was...not incorrect by her frame of reference, but was she going to let him run wild with the idea?  A little.  A handstand became a one-handstand as she pointed at Archer.  &quot;Come now, friend.  I might be a little, or quite, insane, but can&#39;t you imagine that someone might <em>get paid</em> to be funny?  It&#39;s a profession, same as any other.&quot;  Don&#39;t tell her that even the idea of the jester, the fool, the clown had evaporated just the same with time!

Then, a great, big reveal.  The man&#39;s name was out there, and his deeds too!  Triboulet turned herself around to squat upon the can with her hands on her cheeks, and now, he had a rapt audience.  Perhaps, she imagined, the first ever audience he ever had, and ever might have.  Looking over at him and putting on the mask of an awestruck girl, she waited for him to finish his grand elaboration.

This took like ten seconds.  Triboulet really was kinda disappointed.  Couldn&#39;t even name a real feat besides &#39;people were real scared of me&#39;...

Still, for a terror like him, his impromptu daughter didn&#39;t seem at all afraid of someone who did just about every crime he could think of.  His claims were small but they were vile, and she just looked up at him...<em>to</em> him, like a local celebrity?

&quot;And you&#39;d best be happy that I&#39;m taking a break,&quot; she said back, her eyes still aflutter, &quot;because you wouldn&#39;t ever get the chance to share these tales of roguery anywhere else!  Wouldn&#39;t that be a shame?  My, think about it: I speak to the REAL Cherokee Bill,&quot; not that she knew who this was at all, &quot;right before me, and in normal circumstances I&#39;d never realize it!  That&#39;s right, an outlaw, a brigand, a highwayman.  One who kills and ransacks for money, no?  Because of this, I&#39;m <em>suuuuure</em> that you died comfortably, with <em>plenty</em> of cash from your escapades, no?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He didn&#39;t have the faintest idea that Assassin was furious at the butchering of her name. Instead, he focused more on her wise words regarding their curious predicament.

&quot;Huh, I guess ya got a point there.&quot; Bill scratched the back of his head with his gun. When was the last time he had a nice, idle talk? The one with Lachlan in a car? It was a talk, all right, but he didn&#39;t know whether he would call it &#39;nice&#39;.

Granted, speaking to Tribble, as much of an annoying gremlin she was, felt rather refreshing. He wasn&#39;t talking to a modern day human, or a magus on a quest for power. Instead, he was talking to a fellow ghost: Someone who had died eons ago and had now been revived in a quest to obtain the Holy Grail. He had never given the word &#39;Heroic Spirit&#39; much thought, but now his mind was starting to grasp the rare chance these two had to converse from different time periods.

And Bill did like being famous. Although his definition of riches and fame, well...

&quot;Hahaha. You&#39;re cute.&quot; Bill said with laughter so brief that Triboulet wondered if he was taunting her, especially with those words of his. A compliment out of the blue?! Was he trying to send her into shock?

<em>pinch</em>

Even worse, he started pinching at her cheek, like she was a toddler or even worse, a-

<strong>&quot;Yer remind me of my sister.&quot;</strong> Bill said with a smile, while Triboulet felt like her psyche was cracking into pieces. First daughter, now sister...what next?! Was this charlatan so ignorant of the opposite sex that he&#39;d compare her to every woman in existence?!

&quot;She was just like you. Short, troublemaker, ugly with the face of a cow.&quot; He giggled at that last bit while pinching Assassin&#39;s cheeks harder. &quot;But despite all that, she still found a husband.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114281757202710651 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114281757202710651><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 2, 2023 2:57 PM">2:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
His face curled into a frown.

<strong>&quot;A total piece of shit.</strong> An animal that I just couldn&#39;t wait to put down.&quot; He grinned, biting his lip into a sadistic snarl. &quot;I shot him about a billion times, to the point my sister could barely even smile anymore. Then I ran off, but it was too late: My stupid ass left a trail of blood and corpses that spanned miles. They tracked me down, put me in cuffs, and that was that.&quot; He released his grip on the midget, clapping his hands and revealing how it all ended.

&quot;So nope. No riches for me. Not like I cared anyway.&quot; Bill laughed. &quot;I&#39;d rather have my darned sister&#39;s smile back. Well, she&#39;s dead now but...Yeah. You prolly get it.&quot; He shook his head, before realizing that Triboulet looked a little bit more...expectant.

He raised an eyebrow, thought for a bit and then widened his eyes. &quot;What, ya thought I had money on me? What am I, yer sugar daddy?! Yer the one paying me here!&quot; He completely misinterpreted her intent. Instead, he made her visibly cringe.

&quot;I&#39;m not some mutt who kills for money. I killed &#39;cause I could. Ya feel me?&quot; He asked while arching his back, stretching it a bit. All that sitting at the theater made him feel numb. &quot;Even as a clown, ya must have wished to kill someone at times, right? Well, instead of wishing, I just did it.

Didn&#39;t want to meet one of those kinds of outlaws, no sir.

She took that pinch like a champ, only a glance given towards it before she turned attention back to him and his story.  After all, the conversation had turned a little - she wasn&#39;t just an annoying spur in his heel that he&#39;d grind out of existence if it became too much of an issue.  Now, she was someone with <em>some</em> kind of quality in his eyes.  Cute, humorous, and...well, only that.

This feeling that at least some kind of progress was being made was short-lived.  That he was revealing this with such a quick turnaround time already struck her as strange, and there was tension in his brow that suggested something worse was building up behind those words.  She pulled a little away only to find him tugging harder on her face, either in anger or a growing catastrophe being contained - and, not too soon after she gave a &quot;Aww, thank you for the kind words,&quot; after she was called cow-faced, she got her answer.

The man wasn&#39;t just pissed like he was beforehand, prepared to swat her like a fly just to get this vestige of the war he left behind away from himself, but filled with the fury of <em>regret.</em>  That, undoubtedly, was one thing she knew how to spot in an instant.  Triboulet waited, knowing that trying to pull away as he actually delivered his story would only make things messy, but her pleasant demeanor vanished.  She did, indeed, cringe.  This man&#39;s tale wasn&#39;t new, but he was definitely the kind to get riled the moment he calls up an old wound and picks at the scab.

There was something she couldn&#39;t just leave sitting, though.  This brute had taken the wind out of her sails, dodging her barb by admitting he was a piece of shit ahead of her announcement, but he had also all but dared her onward...and with an unexpectedly on-target riposte.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114731077030916186 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114731077030916186><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 3, 2023 8:43 PM">8:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet rose, rubbing at her sore cheek.  &quot;That&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what I was going to get at: a famous criminal is a dead criminal.  You brag about fear, and can you imagine what it got you?&quot;  This wasn&#39;t mocking, this was spoken with a declarative air, the kind of unpleasant air that makes one imagine they&#39;re trying to instill a lesson.  For what use it&#39;d do now, post-script.  &quot;And I DID!  Do you think I would be an <strong>Assassin</strong> if I lived out my life without a single life claimed?  I had one soul I wanted snuffed more than any in the world!  The greatest enemy of all men, the one who posed a greater threat than all of them!&quot;

&quot;And I killed that man!&quot;

She held her hand to her chest.  She looked down at him, and she spoke with vim and vigor, putting out every syllable staccato and making it clear enough to not possibly misinterpret.  Certainty was her form and substance, and for what sounded like a very casual remark from Bill, he got a very vicious response.

She was also lying.

&quot;You&#39;re acting like I&#39;m some kind of inferior.  Keep that smug air down your gullet, and the rest of the air in your body too.  You&#39;ve got way too much of it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I even asked me mom why the hell she bothered to show up to my hanging. Such a stupid thing to go watch some guy&#39;s death, dontcha think?&quot; He asked, shaking his head and taking a deep breath for what he wanted to say next.

&quot;But don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; He continued. <strong>&quot;I don&#39;t have any regrets.</strong> Even if you told me that picking up a gun would get me killed, that famous criminals die young, I&#39;d have still done it.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Y&#39;know how many people showed up at my hanging? I couldn&#39;t tell ya. I couldn&#39;t count them all. How about if I was just some random cow herder?&quot;

&quot;Probably just my mom.&quot; He snickered. &quot;How pathetic is that, right?&quot; Archer seemed to find the circumstances of his death not only humorous, but also something to brag about. He wasn&#39;t boasting about riches, but about fame alone. Triboulet didn&#39;t seem interested, instead continuing with her more vicious reply since Bill seemed to have touched a nerve.

&quot;Assassin, huh.&quot; Bill spoke out loud. Perhaps Triboulet would feel like she had erred at this point, for revealing her Class. Not like it mattered, really, since she knew Bill&#39;s Class as well. The Archer let the Assassin rant a bit longer, talking about her own darker past, what led to her being put into that particular container and all of it culminated in yet another warning directed towards Bill. What an insufferable bastard he was!

He was acutely aware of that, since he tried to rib her more by replying to her snarls with laughter. Maybe Bill would have done great as a jester back in the day.

&quot;Now now, I&#39;m not that arrogant.&quot; Archer cackled. &quot;After the past few days, you could say that I&#39;ve been humbled by the amount of bullshit I had to face.&quot; His head returned memories of Lancer, with the wolf face, and Saber, with the invincible katana.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114875960278405180 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114875960278405180><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 6:19 AM">6:19 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Even a midget like you probably has some worth. And now that you&#39;ve done your little speech, you most definitely do.&quot; Tribble would be confused. Was he praising or mocking her?

&quot;Ya killed someone, but that someone was so important that now the Throne thinks of you as Assassin. That, or there was no Clown Class. Hehehehehe!&quot; He broke down into laughter, as if he had told the funniest joke of all time. &quot;Don&#39;t you feel great? That what you did separated you from the riff-raff? Would you rather be remembered as a dumb court clown than a vicious Assassin? I know what I&#39;d pick.&quot;

The wind now had a slight chill, accentuated by Bill&#39;s words. The two Servants were in the middle of a busy street, surrounded by people from all walks of life. They were just two more numbers to add to a statistic that would be rather forgettable were it not for their past exploits. That was what it meant to be a Heroic Spirit, after all. 

&quot;You aren&#39;t my inferior. If anything, I&#39;m glad to find someone on my same level. Maybe ya can answer something for me.&quot; Bill leaned closer, staring at Triboulet like he was awaiting some sort of response. <strong>&quot;If ya had that choice again, you&#39;d still kill that man, right?&quot;</strong> He asked, bluntly.

&quot;Or would you rather die like a stray bitch, forgotten and unloved?&quot; His eyes narrowed as he further tested Tribble&#39;s character. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not a high bar, but in a better situation, Triboulet probably could&#39;ve come up with some good bits about it.  Maybe that Pagliacci fellow would&#39;ve gotten into the War that way...

On a more serious note, this bastard was getting closer and closer to the quick with these cuts.  First, to her pride, and the knowledge that her tragedy was probably all that brought her into the annals of history.  Second, she was an equal, but with what he was talking about it sounded as if she was the man&#39;s partner in skullduggery and no more.  She was an Assassin and that was it - the same trouble that her Master gave her, evidently, extended to the world: Triboulet was a footnote for her works in theater, but a legend for holding a knife in the dark.

She was tense but collected as he asked his question, one that she had asked herself before.  Unlike Bill, who sounded as if he died at the height of his villainy, she had far too long afterward to dwindle and ponder and regret.

Her response came in the form of a dodged question.  She leaned in as well, her breath hot even in the Egyptian heat.  &quot;That man...<strong>deserves</strong> to die, no matter if it was the year of our lord 1499, or 1999.&quot;  A dodged question, but the hatred that she delivered it did wonders in keeping the focus on her words and not what she wasn&#39;t saying.  &quot;He was a king of France, and a rapacious and cruel <em>cretin</em>.  If I knew that he was coming into power once more...no, if I knew that he was a fighter in this war, I&#39;d take a knee and grovel at the feet of whoever killed him, if I couldn&#39;t do it myself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1114990435845284021 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1114990435845284021><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 1:53 PM">1:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Perhaps to underscore how angry she felt, at some point during her explanation, her hand had reached and found a knife, the sole one she brought with herself today.  It gripped around its handle white-tight, and slightly shook with the tension she was exerting on it.  Such was her will to kill him...and such was her regret that she never, actually, pulled it off.  It was just not meant to be - by her reckoning, God simply favored him more than her.

An Assassin that barely assassinates.  Now THAT&#39;S a good joke.  Bill would&#39;ve died on the spot if he heard that one.

Triboulet turned from Bill&#39;s predatory glare, and to the knife - she released her grip on it.  A moment&#39;s consideration turned to a question for him in return.  &quot;I suppose there could be...other degrees to this conversation.  Somewhere between kingslayer and stray bitch...or hanged outlaw and stray cur...maybe there&#39;s a good line of thought, if you&#39;d take a moment to consider it.&quot;

&quot;From what I see, our lives...they are characterized by those choices, made for and by us.  Hardly a lofty realization, I know, but bear with me: can you imagine what life would be like if you hadn&#39;t shot your brother-in-law, that unequivocal monster?&quot;  She let him ponder for a moment, because it was a broad question.  &quot;Whether it was the wrong choice or not, a different path where your life changed dramatically, that&#39;s almost hard to fathom at all.  How simpler, easier, life would be.  At least, &#39;tis so, for me.&quot;

She briefly gave him a knowing look.  &quot;After all, with how vigorous you were in insisting it was the right choice, perhaps you&#39;ve pondered this question before?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was a jester, a mere charlatan designed to get people to laugh and waste away in the debauchery that was the royal court. Her true nature would only be revealed through Bill&#39;s question, as the clown bared their fangs and spat hot, blistering venom.

Hatred. Pure, unadulterated hatred directed towards the former king of France. Unforgivable and despicable in Triboulet&#39;s eyes, which were now colored in a maddening glint. Gone was the humor and her impish characteristics. All that was left was hate and violence, no different than the mad dog that was Bill. She even took out a knife, a less-than-humorous tool, to prove how serious she was.

Bill didn&#39;t interject. He stood quietly and listened for once, not cracking jokes nor delivering any mocking sneers. He observed Assassin&#39;s reaction, noticing the intensity of her voice and the sincerity of her actions. No one else in the West had cried out as passionately as her. Plenty of people wanted him dead, but their voices rang hollow to his ears. The same applied to Bill Cook&#39;s ambitious plans at the campfire, which sounded similarly empty.

They were lacking a certain spark. A spark that only people like <strong>him</strong> and <strong>Triboulet</strong> had. The only thing that made them worthy of being Heroic Spirits. Something swelled up from within him as he watched the midget continue her speech, before directing the same question towards him.

Was this respect? Envy? Gratitude? Whatever it was, it made him feel happy that his conversation had happened. It finally felt like he had met someone who <em>somewhat</em> understood how he felt.

Unfortunately, she was only halfway there.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115026865887916112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115026865887916112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 4:18 PM">4:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Ya need to ask? After all that?&quot; Bill laughed, referring to Tribble&#39;s own words. &quot;Put me in that spot again, <strong>and I&#39;ll shoot him twice.</strong> Maybe even three times if I feel like it. Bastard had it coming, and no matter what happens to me, I&#39;m always gonna cap his ass.&quot; He grinned, as if reminiscing the death of his brother-in-law with glee.

&quot;Besides, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s great?&quot; He asked out of the blue. &quot;That you stood up to kings and queens. That you didn&#39;t just take it like a good little girl.&quot; His grin widened.

<strong>&quot;I was nothing without the gun.&quot;</strong> He declared, taking out his pistol and placing it to Assassin&#39;s forehead. &quot;I was worth less than dirt. Barely worth the skin on my bones. But <em>this.</em> This changed everything.&quot;

His vision grew more deranged. Triboulet could even feel a slight chill down her spine, as the scruffy mutt-like appearance that Bill had turned into that of a stone cold killer. So, this was the outlaw known as Cherokee Bill. His true visage.

&quot;So yeah, I went bad. <em>Real</em> bad. I robbed, pillaged and stole, because I could. Because they let me. I was no longer worth nothing. Hell, I even did enough bullshit to get summoned as a Servant!&quot; Bill cackled, tooting his own horn and boasting till the end of tomorrow. It sounded like he was giving himself a victory lap, until his voice quieted down and his eyes grew thinner.

&quot;So, tell me, why would I do anything else? Why be good? Why even be &#39;normal&#39;? You said it yourself: Some people just deserve to die. Some people get away with far too much in this crap sack world. If that&#39;s the case, why shouldn&#39;t I be the same?&quot; He pulled back the hammer on his gun, a satisfying <em>clic</em> being heard. 

&quot;I&#39;ve pondered this question a thousand, no, a <em>million</em> times. I can&#39;t find a reason to be good. Even Shaft, god bless him, only tugged at me heart. You didn&#39;t help either, you just confirmed what I already knew.&quot; Bill scoffed. &quot;So tell me, <strong>am I wrong?&quot;</strong> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Fame, to her, was the far greater one over ruthless ambition - she hadn&#39;t characterized her life with violence, even if it was one far from devoid of it.  This wasn&#39;t to say that she found no value in him.  She asked, spent the better part of her one day free of responsibiity - essentially, the one day of a new life she&#39;d ever have - to leave and find a Servant to pick their brain.

She just didn&#39;t imagine it&#39;d be like this.  Not a discussion of arts and history.  Bill was either going to tear her apart, or he was going to find a kindred spirit.

Though there was, in a perverse fashion, one shared trait that she knew she had, but didn&#39;t want to admit to: she and Bill alike, they were <em>awful</em> people whose natural inclination when meeting another tended towards hate.  Antipathy.  What does their reaction afterwards, murder or mockery, matter?

He was firm in his position, and that was something that she just couldn&#39;t get behind.  Get at all, perhaps.  Even if that man were to always be deserving of death no matter how your life went, even if you were always the one to do it, if he wasn&#39;t so damn famous...and so <em>proud of it.</em>  That&#39;s the sticker.

&quot;What I did, it ended up with suffering for those around me,&quot; she said, ironically twisting it closer to the truth.  &quot;I didn&#39;t <em>take it,</em> and I never did before, because I was at least the only soul allowed to speak my mind.  I let him and every one of his noblemen know what terrors they were.  But that, that&#39;s just my story - suppose your man were to be your enemy no matter what path your life had taken.  Suppose you were always to be his killer, even!  And the only difference was that you were...not...famous enough...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115080863168868382 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115080863168868382><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 7:53 PM">7:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her words faltered where her gaze didn&#39;t.  What point was she trying to make, now?  She was speaking for someone she had just met, and he was the judge of his own life.  What did her opinion matter of her, except as an equal?  And for all she knew, well, maybe that life of his was meant to be that way.  The best possible course of action was a young death and an execution - death in obscurity was worse than having your spine snap in half, to suffocate and spasm about for hours.

Did the same apply to her?

Her fame had brought her pain, and it had brought her a death of old age, wasting away in a village in another country with nothing to her name and no one to recognize her and the few things she was proud of.  Death in obscurity...it&#39;d be the same, just less painful.  Yet, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to finish her question.

When he spoke next, a gun was introduced into the conversation in a very flashy fashion.  She didn&#39;t dare think about taking this as an attack, even with the man changing from scavenging buzzard to predatory wolf - something like the same killing intent she had felt in Ruler, but more wanton.  Cold iron pressed a ring into her forehead, and she patiently listened, waited, and considered.

She was actually considering this insane man&#39;s opinion.

He had encountered pain, and she had encountered pain.  They were both nothing, brought up by others - the gun, the king - and given station to enact whatever they wanted in the world.  And through that station...Triboulet had encountered the few joys she had in her life.  Poetry.  Recognition.  Blanche wouldn&#39;t even be born if not for...

In the back of her mind, there was always the self-given security that she wouldn&#39;t die even with the greatest of forces against her...prior to now.  She <em>hadn&#39;t acted the bouffon in some time.</em>  Her life was given the condition of never ending so long as she was funny, and this conversation had been nothing but serious.  Confronted with the fear of her own past, of the tragedy she had just tried to avoid, <em>of the Curse,</em> she was still able to make merry.

Triboulet, for the first time this whole war perhaps, was dead serious.

She was <strong>mortal.</strong>

This gun represented a deliberate choice, even from the otherwise dullardly Archer.  Triboulet could try and swipe, push the gun away, stab him with the knife still in her hand and ensure a mutual death.  She could make fun of him, pull out some shitty wisecrack about how it&#39;s unkind to put that in a woman&#39;s face after they just met, and she&#39;d be granted immortality again...

...did he know?  Did Bill figure it out, her Noble Phantasm?  She had no doubt that Bill was a brute, but she could be looking upon one with some sort of unseen intuition, or maybe he was just that damn observant.  It almost sounded too absurd to be true, but had he backed her into a corner, metaphorically and philosophically?

He would be the final judge here, not her.  She had the choice, and it was an ironic one: to avoid it once again, to lie, or to tell the truth - and hope that the answer pleased this jackal.  If Bill was <strong>nothing without the gun,</strong> he had made his move to ensure that she&#39;d also be made whole with it, or be ended summarily by it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115081043767205968 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115081043767205968><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 4, 2023 7:53 PM">7:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet had far less time to ponder it than a million goes.

They were a stranger to him, someone from a completely different time period that he had zero clue about. He couldn&#39;t even read a book back in his day, let alone hear about some famous court jester that was older than his great, great, great, great grandma. To interrogate someone like that on their viewpoints, with a gun included in the conversation, was the height of stupidity. What was he hoping to earn from this?

But one good thing that the talk did was get him to reflect on his past, something that he didn&#39;t often do. After all, since when could an outlaw afford to look back at when they first screwed up? Those two years Bill spent on the run felt like forty to him, while his childhood was barely a blip. He remembered his motto back in the day: To live life simply, with zero issues. Back then, the most joy he&#39;d feel was when his cattle actually obeyed his commands unlike that shit horse of his. The scent of booze paired with a boiled egg. And when lookers from out of town would show up at the saloon, he&#39;d always make a move on them, only to get shot down or worse, pummeled by their friends.

No one respected the little man. Especially not someone like Bill, who was destined to lose. He felt bile rising up to his throat as he reminisced those memories: How could he even stand it back in the day? To be known as the cattle boy, to live a pathetic life of getting treaded on by others? He had no one to protect him. Not his mom, not his dad. Not even Bill Cook. His only ever friend was the gun. It felt like a part of him that he could never leave behind. About as important to him as a third hand, a sixth finger, a second heart.

That&#39;s why he was surprised when he heard that Triboulet loathed her own skills. Could he ever hate himself for becoming what he was? Could he ever hate the power that the gun gave him? Not in a million years!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115384457067773975 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115384457067773975><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 5, 2023 3:59 PM">3:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Heh. Heheheheh. Nice one.&quot; Bill chuckled, snapping back to the present as he slowly lowered his gun. &quot;You <em>hated</em> being the so-called court jester? I coulda sworn ya loved it just moments ago, flaunting about it like no tomorrow.&quot; He slapped his knee, giggling like a child.

&quot;Guess we&#39;re all fucking liars here, aren&#39;t we?&quot; He sneered, scratching the back of his head with his gun. It was interesting to see someone who hated what brought them into the spotlight. Bill didn&#39;t exactly understand it, to him it was acting spoiled, like his mom used to say. But this Triboulet person, they were, as much as he pained to admit it, <em>kind of smart.</em> If they had a reason, it probably wasn&#39;t a stupid one.

Perhaps he was growing soft and giving them too much credit, but he was still interested in hearing the why.

&quot;I know I&#39;m right!&quot; He nodded his head, casually taking Tribble&#39;s praise as if it was sincere. &quot;The me before Cherokee Bill? A pathetic, lowlife maggot, that&#39;s who!

She felt <em>dirty</em> after saying that to his face, duress or not, and the look on her face reflected her feelings wholeheartedly.  She still hated it all and she still cursed and spat on those responsible for her induction into court life, and now she felt like she had just made herself a hypocrite.  This was no lie and her &#39;praise&#39; was sincere, if strained.  But the good...

...she didn&#39;t want to say that the good outweighed the bad.  More like, her life would be terrible no matter what happened, the extremes were simply preferable to the middling &#39;if&#39;.

Triboulet&#39;s eyes looked up at him ruefully as she was laughed at for all the wrong reasons; her stomach curled as she was called out on her slip up revealing plain two-faced thought.  &quot;I like the art.  I like the recognition <em>from the common man</em>,&quot; she said, very straightforward and without airs.  &quot;But the people I played to directly are all the worst damn people.  If you ever come to France, somehow, please go and kill every single member of the French aristocracy.&quot;

She wasn&#39;t privy to the French Revolution, beyond a notion that the days of kings were past...but hey, was Bill really gonna end up in Frankish lands?

Dismounting from the garbage can finally, the tension of her admission only now running out and leaving her body in the shakes, the little Assassin looked up at a fellow liar.  Now, she could go and rip into him, say that she really was unfortunate as a dwarf with a (not that prominent) hunchback, but did this man really have the &#39;&#39;capacity&#39;&#39; for pity?  No.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115519643092783124 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115519643092783124><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 6, 2023 12:56 AM">12:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A smile came on as Archer laughed it up.  &quot;Getting stepped on by those too tall to see me; that, I could do without.&quot;  The comedy resumed, and she retreated into the safety of sarcasm.  &quot;There are many things I could say about how people like me were treated, monsieur, but really...I was far from the worst of my kind.  I won&#39;t bore you with a eulogy.&quot;

Walking about him, she put her hands behind her back as she tried to straighten up.  &quot;For a pathetic, lowlife maggot, you certainly put on a good show with that praise of yourself.  What is that I hear in my head...a little voice telling me that I might be looking upon the next star of the stage?  An actor stands before me, one skilled in playing the role of a man with no worries.&quot;  Just one hypocrisy on his part had to be called out.  &quot;Your script betrays thee, however.  For the man who doesn&#39;t care, would he really kill to save his sister, no matter the justification?  And would he even remember his mother and her presence at his death?  A weak-spot, maybe.&quot;

&quot;Do not worry.  If there&#39;s anything you&#39;ve gotten from me,&quot; she held up a hand...and she did wonder how quick she could pull that gun from his, just to put this son of a bitch down, but she quelled that thought, &quot;it&#39;s a level of begrudging respect.&quot;

&quot;Tell me: do you feel like that&#39;s something you&#39;ve ever had?  Fear, yes, but what about respect?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cat was out of the bag and it all made sense now: Just like how Bill couldn&#39;t stomach the idea of working in the army or the rangers, Tribble hated the thought of performing for a group of decadent aristocrats, people that consumed art just to say that they experienced it. Those who ate without tasting and simply held the jester as a trophy of some sort.

Of course, Bill wasn&#39;t as artistically involved as his fellow Servant. He couldn&#39;t fathom why one would prefer the common audience of peasants over somebody more &#39;dignified&#39;, but the frustration in Assassin&#39;s face was enough to give him a hint or two. That type of &#39;art&#39; didn&#39;t seem right to him, just like how a gun wasn&#39;t meant to be displayed, but to be used.

<em>&quot;I&#39;ll kill them all.&quot;</em> He flashed his gun with a smile, doing so quickly that Triboulet was caught off guard by his swift response. &quot;Sounds like fun anyway. Never got the chance to kill a noble myself.&quot; There was the psychopathic behavior again...

Triboulet then continued, showering Bill with more reluctant praise. &quot;Ha! Good one, but I ain&#39;t no Shaft. Maybe in another lifetime.&quot; He joked, albeit deep down, he did wish he was someone like that. A heroic main character that most could root for. Perhaps that is why he even deigned to answer Assassin&#39;s next question.

&quot;I&#39;m a bastard, but I&#39;m no animal. You wouldn&#39;t feel bad if your sister was given a shit hand? Do ya still remember ya mama&#39;s face?&quot; He asked, narrowing his eyes. To him, caring about those who cared about him just felt natural, neither good nor bad. At least, that&#39;s what he told himself. He preferred to avoid thinking about the little things, which was part of the reason why he hadn&#39;t degenerated into a monstrous villain just yet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115721420324999169 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115721420324999169><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 6, 2023 2:18 PM">2:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But what caught Bill completely off guard was lil&#39; Tribble offering her hand, along with her respect. He can&#39;t remember the last time he got told that, not even by Bill Cook, who only  saw him as an efficient tool. Earning someone&#39;s respect never crossed Bill&#39;s mind, for he had already accepted his life as a lone hyena in the world of outlaws. It was better to be feared by all than be oppressed and put down, at least that&#39;s what he thought. 

To earn someone&#39;s respect, even if it came from an ugly little gremlin like Tribble, was something that shocked him. He didn&#39;t even have the respect of his own Master, yet had appealed to some wandering Servant?!

&quot;Oi, stop it now. Even somebody like me got pride. Are ya telling me ya thought I looked sad enough to only get respect from midgets?!&quot; Bill spat out, disgruntled. &quot;Tch. It don&#39;t matter anyway. What is fear but just another form of respect? Just the kind that gets people to shut up instead of licking yer balls.&quot; He confessed, then immediately defended himself, acting more childish than Triboulet for once. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I&#39;ve never been one with a sister.  I don&#39;t remember whatever warty look my mother would&#39;ve had either, for that matter.&quot;  This wasn&#39;t something she expected to come up, but unlike many of the other questions, it didn&#39;t sound like it was a bother to think about.  That was just a fact of her life, that she was raised sans a real figure to call family.  The streets were her mother, perhaps.  Very philosophical and poncey to think about.

&quot;Maybe you liked yours, but I would rather not have someone who&#39;d kick me about like a ball down the cobble just for looking at her funny.  Siblings, even if they like each other, can be truly vicious creatures.&quot;  That was her estimate of them, if from faint memories of childhood and how quick brothers in the Court were to stab each other.

Small and dainty was her hand, and it remained held out after the man refused to lock it with his big, scarred one.  The jester waited expectantly for a formal acceptance of her respect for a little bit, silently staring at him after he brushed off her offer - and talked shit about her height - and it didn&#39;t take Bill long to figure that he was being judged.  Harshly.  Like a mother to a child that has something far from praiseworthy...

Her hand was returned before he could choose to take it or not.  &quot;You&#39;d certainly seem to be fearless with how little you shut up,&quot; came her cold response.  Then, she turned around.  Was she going to just leave him standing there in the street?  It took a bit before she looked back and said &quot;I&#39;m tiring of this conversation.  As addled as I am, I know better than to keep ramming my head against a wall.  Come on, we&#39;ve got dumb amusements to distract ourselves with, yet.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115739023412052039 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115739023412052039><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 6, 2023 3:28 PM">3:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The two would wander through the streets as before.  The eyes of the public did wander their way often, and it was usually Triboulet who gave a mean glance back to get them to piss off, or at least seem offended enough to break contact.  This journey meandered more and found little that she thought would be worthy of their time, the closest being a streetside vendor who claimed to have ancient Egyptian artifacts for sale...which she realized, quick enough, probably wouldn&#39;t be so shiny and inexpensive after thousands of years in the dirt.

Eventually, she did pause her search to look at one place.  It was a couple of narrow but long stalls at the base of the building, open to the air on this end and it loudly blared with a hundred different sources of noise.  This was really quite loud altogether, even more so than Shaft&#39;s constant gunfire and Bill&#39;s delirious hooting.  Above it all hung a sign in the local script: MAGIC WORLD ARCADE AND DRINK

This place, the &#39;arcade&#39;, had little of the greenery and sweeping vistas you&#39;d think of when you call to mind &#39;Arcadia&#39;.  It was located in a place both fortunate and unfortunate, as it looked dirty, run-down, the owner seemed sketchy and he had bottles of mystery drinks sitting in fridges behind him with children running around...but that was the exact goodness of it, the children.  It was placed smack-dab at the edge between Berenice, the haughty tourist location and small colony of Europe where every other store has white tile kept fastidious by janitorial serfs, and Berenice, the Egyptian city that was crowded between the gaps in the former, with the poor and the worn.  Just close enough to the resorts that unsupervised children could come, just close enough to the tenements - and cheap enough, the machines only cost 25 <em>piastre</em> to play - for the kids off school to attend en masse.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1115739105184186388 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1115739105184186388><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 6, 2023 3:28 PM">3:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The two demographics didn&#39;t seem to mingle that often, but here and there you could see a few clustered around a machine to watch whatever was going on.  Some people were older, usually locals, who gathered to play games that they couldn&#39;t dream of affording at home.  

That was what caught Triboulet&#39;s eyes initially, as the things projected on screens looked like crudely animated copies of real life, but then she realized it was as she had seen in the frozen department store - <em>controllable</em> simulations!  She could see from here people playing sports, racing in brightly colored automobiles with jaunty music, gorily murdering animate corpses (which faintly reminded her of something), flying around in machines without wings to propel them - a spectacular variety of fantastical games to play!  That, and there apparently was a kitchen somewhere, as there was fried food floating around in little red plastic baskets.

And none of this seemed like &#39;art&#39; to her, so she wasn&#39;t enthused.

Triboulet didn&#39;t immediately dismiss it, turn her hand over and say &quot;Keep moving, we&#39;ll find a museum sooner or later&quot; though.  She took a breath to speak and say as much, but held it, and looked up to see Bill&#39;s reaction to all of this...was he going to be as enthusiastic as she imagined?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He knew his own feelings and values, but it was easy for a human being to ignore their thoughts if they avoided mirrors and just kept chasing the next high. Self-reflection and introspection was akin to a muscle, but Bill had purposefully left his untrained. Maybe thinking was just too painful, or worse, it just made him too <em>damn</em> angry.

Accepting Tribble&#39;s kindness, respect, or what not, was something that implied facing those thoughts. He didn&#39;t want to, so he just brushed it off, albeit he raised his eyebrow at the death glare that she flashed back at him. If he weren&#39;t made of sterner stuff, he was sure that she would have decapitated him where he stood.

&quot;Geez, don&#39;t get your panties in a twist. Fine, I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m coming.&quot; Bill sounded far too apologetic, like a wounded puppy. Assassin shutting him up seemed to have shook him a bit, enough for the cowboy to reluctantly follow his tour guide. They kept walking, coming across passerby and street vendors, only for Triboulet to scare them off with her glares. It reminded Bill of an aggressive, stray cat, which is why he always preferred dogs.

Eventually, they came across a section of the island that looked rather familiar. Bill could see faint border lines in the distance, along with piles of rubble and destroyed appliances. This was where Pyg had rampaged just a few days ago, murdering dozens and doing a dent on Berenice&#39;s older buildings. He even remembered it destroying a-

<strong>MAGIC WORLD ARCADE AND DRINK</strong>

-That. Bill&#39;s eyes widened: Hadn&#39;t this store been destroyed during his chase for Lachlan just days ago? It was already back up?! Even better (or worse), children and adults were happily mingling inside of it, playing around and enjoying a drink. Either he had hallucinated his past experiences, or the owners had worked double to rebuild it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116448490541818037 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116448490541818037><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 8, 2023 2:27 PM">2:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Perhaps this was fate, for once Bill stared at the store, he couldn&#39;t look away. The smell of fresh <em>shoreek</em>, coupled with the attractive shelf filled with booze, was like heaven to an outlaw. Plus, he could spy a strange machine in the corner of an eye, one with a very gun-shaped item.

Triboulet&#39;s face was fixed with a permanent glare, her sizing up the entire building and casting her judgment in just a minute: Not worth a time. How could a fancy screen with obtuse controls compete with the timeless classics of old Egyptian steles and one of the richest cultures in the world? Even a mutt like Bill deserved more than th-

Where was Bill? She would shake her head around to find the tall bastard, but he had vanished like a ghost. It wasn&#39;t until she stared at the blackness of the arcade bar that she noticed a shadow with an obnoxious looking hat.

<em>glup glup glup</em>

Bill had waited so long without a drink that he thought he might have gone sober. Good thing he fixed that by immediately downing down a fresh glass of booze, filled with the richest foam. He had found his oasis in the desert, and he would be damned if he let that escape from him!

&quot;Another one!&quot; Bill shouted, raising his glass as the bartender came through. Triboulet would feel a tinge of disgust as she saw Bill pass the staff money. <em>Her</em> money. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

At first she looked behind her, wondering if someone had held up something appropriately gluttonous like...what&#39;s the worst thing she could think of...<em>fried butter,</em> even if that was surely impossible.  He wasn&#39;t there, and it wasn&#39;t as if he had the ability to conceal his presence.

If anything, Bill would have a Presence <em>Boosting</em> ability.  Somehow.

&quot;Where on Earth did...&quot;

The answer was obvious, in hindsight.  She turned back to the arcade, at first seeing nothing and only realizing that one of the silhouettes against cathode ray light was much more prominent than the rest.  The man was rested against a worn concrete countertop, a drink disappearing, all but evaporating with each passing moment.

Triboulet stared at him, petulant.  It was a waste of just about everything she had a hand on, and the only thing left to waste was his life, but now wasn&#39;t the time for violence.  Really, she should just walk, let him drink himself until he pisses his pantaloons, and then be left with only some what-could-have-beens...

...but Triboulet thought, as even she is wont to do, and she looked at him closer.  She had an unpleasant idea.  The best kind of idea.  Her face broke out in a wry smile...

Pulling it off was a very easy task, as there&#39;s no attack to be made, so little chance of being noticed, let alone by his drunken, dulled senses.  A brief step outside, a stolen bit of plant from a stall down the street, and a moment&#39;s time to grind it all down with the pommel of her knife.  Then, wait, and apply...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116476879172554883 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116476879172554883><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 8, 2023 4:20 PM">4:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>When Bill asked for his next drink, which would probably be within the minute of the last one, he&#39;d receive it.

Perhaps too odd; if he was wise he&#39;d question the circumstances, but just how wise <em>could</em> he be?

His drink went down nice and smooth, as clean as stuff around here can be, but hopefully the addition of locally grown peppers ground to a paste and mixed in when the bartender wasn&#39;t looking didn&#39;t burn him too badly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

At least, that&#39;s what Bill thought whenever he stared at his drink, which wasn&#39;t often. Usually, he would just grab the glass and-

<em>plop</em>

-drink it while simultaneously doing something else. It was an efficient way to manage his time, with one hand on his drink and the other playing cards, counting bullets, feeling up women, that sort of stuff. He immediately reached for his glass and placed the drink on his lips.

Then Tribble finally made herself known, sitting right beside him and making sure she was impossible to miss. He expected a scolding, but instead saw her lips form a cherubic smile as she rested her palms on her cheeks, expectedly waiting for something to happen.

&quot;Ya done being a sourpuss?&quot; Bill asked, surprised. He hadn&#39;t expected for Assassin to simply let him do as he pleased, or even look happy at all, really. The deep recesses of his mind suspected something, but the aloof, tipsy side had taken hold of the reins. He assumed the only thing he could when he thought about why Triboulet could be so happy in such a place..

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; He started to finally take a sip. <strong>&quot;Yer thirsty.</strong> Shoulda just said so! Even women need to drink, sometimes. Brats too, heheheh.&quot; There goes that ugly laugh again, followed by a snap of the fingers. &quot;Bartender, another drink, and add one for my lil&#39; friend over here!&quot; He flexed his generosity, though it rang hollow when the money belonged to Triboulet in the first place.

It didn&#39;t matter though, not when Assassin had already received her &#39;payment&#39;. She watched as Bill gulped down the entire glass in a single breath, then wiped the slobber off his mouth like the animal he was. What an unrefined, disgusting beast. It was curious how he had survived the Wild West in the first place.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116486610775724042 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116486610775724042><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 8, 2023 4:59 PM">4:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Ugh...&quot; It started, which made Triboulet even more impatient. Bill started clutching at his stomach, then at his throat. His eyes started to look watery, his movements jittery. His pupils were darting around the room, as if looking for a ray of hope. Bathroom? Exit? A pair of inconspicuous bushes? Ah, such a delight to see the outlaw squirm! He started panting, sticking his tongue out and ready to scream. This was amaz-

<em><strong>&quot;WOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;</strong></em> Bill shrieked, loud enough to rupture the entire arcade&#39;s eardrums. &quot;That&#39;s the stuff! That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! Sheesh!&quot; He fanned himself with his palm, sweat drops trickling down his neck. &quot;Thought I was gonna die there, but phew. Fucking delicious.&quot; He laughed. Assassin would be incredulous. Archer found those peppers mixed with booze <em>tasty?!</em> Was his palate so devolved that he assumed a strong, overpowering taste meant that the food was good?!?

&quot;Bartender, another one of those!&quot; Bill raised his finger. &quot;Though, warn me next time...&quot; He whimpered, letting his body loose as he dangled from the stool. He then remembered Assassin existed and cast a glance to her.

&quot;Ya can&#39;t have those. It&#39;s a bit too much for you.&quot; He laughed, tapping at his empty glass and recommending she take a &#39;normal&#39; drink. The ignorant fool. &quot;But at least you don&#39;t have that ugly ass frown on you anymore. Doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot; She couldn&#39;t tell if that was a compliment or not.

&quot;Ya see those by the way?&quot; He pointed to the arcade machines in the distance. &quot;What the hell are they? Ya know everything, right?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;To the fire of competition,&quot; she said, already relishing the sudden pain that was sure to wrack him.

She tipped the glass back and took a good swig herself, not a stranger to hard drinking at all as alcohol flowed like water in her job.  Her eyes looked up and watched - he was a glutton and drank it all in one go, he was a buffoon and didn&#39;t notice the exotic, burning taste until it was too late, and he was a damned man, waiting for Gehenna&#39;s eternally burning fields to consume him.  Just you wait, Bill!  Triboulet already made the mistake of underestimating these foreign berries, and she paid dearly.  Would he survive a minute, no, half a minute before he fell over, fat tongue stuck out and begging for water?  No surprise that they were in a desert, and yet this was an incendiary hellscape of his own making.  Look, now, he&#39;s about to crack that tough facade of his and...

...ah.

Even Triboulet, Heroic Spirit and the one expectant in the first place, jumped back in surprise when he took to the drink like a lap dog to an untarnished ankle.  She almost spilled her own drink, a little did trickle did run down her face.  Just how loud can...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116772396439965706 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116772396439965706><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 11:54 AM">11:54 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Somehow, she had run into the only man in the world who&#39;d get hung and end up even more of a masochist!  Incredulous she was, putting down her drink as Bill extolled the virtues of this unexpected delight.  Can&#39;t pull anything on this kind of man, too stupid and too easily pleased to have anything besides his pride be wounded.  Briefly, she grimaced for a lack of success, but returned to her smile just right after - can&#39;t let the deception be found out, whether it bore fruit or fallow.

&quot;Trust me, dear Bill, you looked like you were about to drip down into the grates below and melt away.  I couldn&#39;t imagine what you had in that thing, and I would rather remain ignorant!&quot;  Internally, she just chalked it up to him being some degree of insane.  &quot;My drink is fine,&quot; tastes like shit honestly, &quot;and if that&#39;s what&#39;s to keep me pleasant, I&#39;ll drink alongside you!&quot;

Immortal or no, Triboulet did <em>not</em> trust him enough to get drunk in Bill&#39;s presence - or anyone&#39;s presence.  She&#39;d never fall victim to this kind of thing again...

The bartender, oblivious to all of Assassin&#39;s petty games, simply made Archer another drink without anything spicy in it.  It&#39;d definitely burn still, the remaining capsaicin oil rooted in his mouth firing up again when it came into contact with the sting of alcohol, but not as much - Triboulet was served a second drink as well, though she hadn&#39;t finished her first.  Dumb tourists and their money are quickly parted.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116772449703432272 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116772449703432272><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 11:55 AM">11:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The jester leaned back on the counter, looking at the rows of arcade machines.  &quot;Ah, those?  You didn&#39;t even come here for the machines, just the alcohol, I see.&quot;  It didn&#39;t surprise her at all, just disappointed her.  &quot;I know very little, but I can put two and two together, which is probably two better than the best you can pull off.  They&#39;re machines like the television, you can see the same glow and hear the same hum...but they&#39;re controlled by rods and buttons.  The action moves with your will, not the script of the play.  Though it doesn&#39;t seem very realistic at all...&quot;

One of the nearer machines was one of the newest ones, a game of barefoot men punching and kicking each other in the face...in <strong>3D!</strong>  This was something that she didn&#39;t have as much appreciation for as the gobsmacked children of the day, though.  &quot;Look at that,&quot; she pointed at it and hoped his Servant senses were stronger than the booze, &quot;how uncanny it looks - they&#39;re not mere drawings, or creations of pointillism...it&#39;s as if someone was making animate metal dolls dance around on a stage...dreadful, I think.&quot;

&quot;...but, in total, these things are games to be played.  You&#39;ve at least got stick-and-hoop over in whatever the West is, yes?  Spain?  I&#39;ve met a few <em>courte-paume</em> players from there.  It&#39;s the modern incarnation of those kind of pastimes - a <strong>machine game</strong>,&quot; she said, getting close but missing the cigar.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Enough to fool a slightly tipsy Archer, it seemed.

&quot;Finally yer speaking my language. Nothing but a good drink to wash down the day!&quot; He grabbed his new glass, then immediately pushed it towards Assassin, their cups colliding into a delightful (mostly awkward) <em>cin cin</em>, as the elite called it. Their drinking session was accompanied by something a bit more stimulating, as Triboulet gave her very thoughtful and analytical response to the dullard&#39;s question. She could see him scratch his head at times, a clear sign that he didn&#39;t get it, but didn&#39;t care enough to ask. The type of purposeful ignorance that made her vomit.

Perhaps she shouldn&#39;t have these thoughts while drinking...

&quot;So, TV but you can, like, move the people.&quot; Bill repeated, putting two fingers on the countertop and moving them around like a little man. He imagined Shaft being in that position instead. How badass would it be if he could control Shaft&#39;s actions on the movie screen? It would be almost as the same as being Shaft himself!

Then Assassin continued, noticing a particular set of arcade machines that included sweaty, bare chested men fighting in an open field with nothing but their own palms. Encounters were of the close kind and she could sense an intimate rivalry between two of the male characters currently beating each other up on screen. It felt almost appealing to look at, until a woman popped in with an odd focus on her posterior and her...finer parts. It was easy for her to tune out after that and for her to ponder on how the modern world had degenerated so much in terms of entertainment. Back in her day, people like her didn&#39;t have impossible standards to live up to. Certainly not the mindless sex appeal of the modern world!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116859379052970035 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116859379052970035><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 5:40 PM">5:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;Colt-a-poom?</em> What?&quot; Bill raised a shaky, drunk lil&#39; eyebrow at Triboulet&#39;s French. It wasn&#39;t until she dumbed it down for him that he understood. &quot;Ohhhh, so like Blackjack or something. That&#39;s cool.&quot; He said, glancing away, implying that he had no interest...until he rose up from his stool and carried his glass alongside him.

&quot;So, this is a <strong>gambling saloon!&quot;</strong> He immediately came to that conclusion. He did not stop and consider that the new world might have, y&#39;know, new traditions, new culture, new ethics and standards compared to the lawless times of the Wild West. Not like anybody would step up to correct him.

Bill marched towards the peculiar arcade machine, noticing its intricate stick and buttons system, along with the stock footage that was playing on the screen, showing two characters alternating moves with each other as their life bars lowered and the combo counter kept growing. Even more peculiar were the trays next to the arcade machine, clearly makeshift coasters designed to hold drinks. A post-it note was attached to the machines as well, its content written in Egyptian along with an English translation.

<em>PAY 25&#162; TO PLAY FOR 1 MATCH OR BUY A DRINK TO PLAY FOR 3 MATCHES</em>

A clever scheme designed to milk the adult populace by combining playtime with beer. Buying a drink gave you a lot more playtime, but it was a clear marketing gimmick. Unfortunately, that was the type of scheme that worked well against fools like Bill.

&quot;I get to play <em>and</em> drink?&quot; Bill chuckled, clasping his hands as if he was praying in convent, grateful for the modern world and all the debauchery that came with it. &quot;Alright, who wants a piece of me?!&quot; He screamed out loud, daring someone to challenge him as he fiddled with the stick and buttons, still unaware of how the controls worked. What he did know, however, was that he would definitely be buying a drink once his current glass ran out.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116859437613850645 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116859437613850645><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 5:40 PM">5:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

...well, no.  Wait.  It was a different time.  From her seat, as she began her second drink, she could see children desecrating corpses with gunfire, sending unreal amounts of blood flying all over the screen.  Another cabinet had a man bisected by a spinning hat-blade, and to describe the victor&#39;s reaction as anything but childlike glee would be a bold lie.  Perhaps this was Triboulet&#39;s very overprotective parental tendencies bleeding into her thought, or maybe the alcohol, but all of this seemed as if it was a bit above a child&#39;s level.

Maybe, nowadays, gambling really is just the matter <em>du jour</em> for the youngsters.  &quot;How bizarre,&quot; she said out loud as she unknowingly started a second drink.

Bill ambled over with his legs already a-wobble, ready to engage in sin and decadence.  Triboulet didn&#39;t follow him there at first, figuring that he&#39;d be back here and was just following whatever immediately caught his attention, but sure enough he had his attention stuck onto one specific game:  <em>The World Fightblast Tournament EXTREME Maxxi-Boost.</em>  The advertising screed on the side of the machine promised life-like 3D graphics, over 12 characters, the apparently patented D.E.S.T.R.O.Y.E.R. processing chip boasting an incredible 32 megabytes of pure power, and gameplay far superior to that of its unnamed competitors.  Considering it was the machine that had already unnerved Triboulet with its primitive renderings of human faces, she wasn&#39;t inclined to follow him at all.  In fact, she ignored him, and let him bash his brains into the stick as he pleased.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117611620676407397 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117611620676407397><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 7:29 PM">7:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This didn&#39;t last.  She kept her eyes closed and feigned having no knowledge of this strange man once he started shouting for challengers, figuring that these twelve-year-olds would want to challenge someone twice their height.  She, instead, began her third drink in as many minutes.  It was a secret to everyone, but it seemed that Bill had unknowingly found someone who could match him in a battle of the liver.

Her attempt to remain separate from him was foiled once specifically called out, as she instinctually shouted back at him, &quot;My legs are perfectly proportional!&quot;  Assassin held her ice-cold glass to her face to cool it down, and then downed it in one go.  With her own walking starting to show a little less coordination, she walked over to him just to keep him from shouting.

It was definitely the alcohol that made her a little more amenable to taking him up on his offer.  Why not?  It was going to be a mere division of a dollar.  She&#39;d play him, give him a good time, and then that&#39;d at least keep him from making a scene.  Amuse him without humor, that&#39;s what she&#39;d do.

&quot;I suppose I can give you a good showing.&quot;  She placed her hand on the stick, which she didn&#39;t need a box to reach thankfully, and after a couple of attempts slid a coin into the slot correctly.  &quot;I&#39;m no good at games.  It&#39;s never a jester&#39;s right to actually <em>win</em> a match of sports, you see...those bastards, they all want to see me lose and laugh; that&#39;s what I&#39;m good for.  You&#39;ve got me dead to rights from the moment I step up...&quot;

She slowly turned to look at him, eyes already a little glassy.  &quot;Of course, if you lose to a mere clown in a game for children...well, let&#39;s not imagine such an <em>embarrassing</em> scenario.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117611658509045780 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117611658509045780><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 7:29 PM">7:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The machine roared to life, literally, as animate lion statues flanked the screen - a selection of characters appeared, each one corresponding to a place on a projected image of a globe.  They seemed to come from all walks of life, at least all the walks that allowed for a very athletic build (for the men) and shapely forms (for the women) at least.  Triboulet managed to figure out the stick as the means of moving the selection around soon enough, and went over the characters in turn.

One of them went by Pierre, and he was from her homeland.  He had a flat beret on his head, a striped shirt and black pants, a very twirled moustache, and an elegant rapier to fight with.  The screen helpfully noted that his likes were fine wine and frog legs, and that his blood type was B+.  Why, it was as if these people had some kind of intimate knowledge on how to write a Frenchman!

Triboulet skipped him over.  Something about the sight alone made her feel angry.

Instead, she went with what appeared to be an upright bear in bib overalls and a furred hat named Barry, hailing from some far off land called &quot;Canada&quot;.  She understood this game to be a competition of strength, and what human could hope to outmatch a bear in raw power?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A na&#239;ve person might assume he was happy to play with a friend, but Assassin could clearly tell that he was just a dog wanting something to chew on. In this case, she was the <em>bone.</em> How delightful.

&quot;Buncha fancy words just to say ya wanna beat my ass.&quot; Bill laughed so loud that it almost sounded like a threat. &quot;Ohhh I&#39;m gonna enjoy beating you, pipsqueak. Say, since this is a gambling saloon, how about we make this interesting? We&#39;re paying on yer tab, so money is out of the question. Hmmm...&quot; He stroked his chin, deep in thought before a figurative bulb lit up his head.

&quot;I know: Whenever ya lose, <strong>ya take one extra shot.&quot;</strong> Bill raised his finger, then pointed at his nearby glass. &quot;We keep going till one of us drops or gives up. Whichever is quicker, heheh.&quot; He chuckled, sounding like the type of person who had employed similar bets in the past.

That cocky grin, that broody getup and terrible personality. Everything about Bill made Triboulet want to absolutely pummel him. Likewise, Bill couldn&#39;t wait to tread on this midget like the ant that she was. Tension filled the air as they both inserted a coin and started selecting their characters.

&quot;Wait, yer picking the bear?! Oh, fuck off! I wanted that!&quot; Bill growled, so loud that Assassin almost felt tempted to switch, until he reluctantly switched off Barry and started looking elsewhere, harrumphing as he did so. At this point, offering to switch characters would have felt like an insult, so it was best to avoid that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117909707127017632 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117909707127017632><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 12, 2023 3:14 PM">3:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Fine then. Ya wanna play it like that, then-&quot; Bill&#39;s reticle circled around various sets of characters: Cowboys, samurais, gorillas, scantily clad women. He seemed to have no interest in them, which puzzled Assassin. Surely he could see bits of himself in cowboys? Instead, she could only watch in horror as he selected the worst type of character for her to face.

<strong>A clown.</strong>

She had skipped him so easily that her mind had almost not perceived them at all. They were a clown called Pagliacci, apparently from Italy according to the limited in-game lore. They wore a mixture of colors, a ridiculous looking hat and a Pulcinella mask from <em>La Commedia dell&#39;Arte.</em> Even worse was the jester elements that were part of their costume, such as bells, hoods with limp horns and so on.

They were ridiculously buff though. One of their arms was probably the length of Triboulet&#39;s entire body. It wasn&#39;t surprising for a brute like Bill to pick a character with such overwhelming looks, but the corner of Assassin&#39;s mind clearly thought that the Archer was subconsciously taunting her.

&quot;Heh.&quot; It was small. A little one. A little, tiny giggle that escaped Bill&#39;s mouth. He slowly turned his head to the right, then tilted it down so that he could stare at Triboulet&#39;s face. His expression gave it all away: A sadistic smile that you would see on any person up to no good. The type of trollish face that she did herself at times. Perhaps in another life, she could have taken up Bill as an apprentice jester. If she didn&#39;t kill him first, that is.

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ve picked. Come to think of it, I did say we would keep going until one of us falls off, but-&quot; He tilted his head closer. <strong>&quot;-what is the prize we are betting on the line?</strong> There has to be something for the winner. Dem the rules.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whatever qualities he held or similarities they shared, Triboulet&#39;s of the firm mind that the average sewer was more agreeable than him, for at least it had the good sense to keep shit out of the public eye.  But keep this in mind: alcohol is a fine grease with which to spin the wheels of the social mind...and this clown&#39;s tendencies to drink heavily were compounded by how easily it affected her, deep into the glass.  She already was feeling some effects as her cheeks flushed, and the contempt she held for him seemed to cool down just a little now.

When Bill gave his first stipulation, she looked up to him with a smirk.  &quot;A good game.  The courtiers, they&#39;d take any excuse they could to shove more drink down their fat necks, so I&#39;m all too familiar.  Thankfully, I will not lose.&quot;  Triboulet chuckled.

Her gambit of picking the apparently-intelligent-enough-to-wear-clothes bear had at least earned her a psychological advantage.  Archer, immediately, had seen him and 
decided he would be the most fit to fight out of this cast.  Would he be able to battle in full confidence, knowing that the <em>most superior of fighters</em> was going to be his opponent?  Triboulet&#39;s satisfaction at his anger was second to the edge she&#39;d enjoy...and she wasn&#39;t even trying to make him mad!  Already, she imagined victory ahead!

What would he pick in retaliation?  Who was the <em>second</em> best member of the cast?  Which challenger could--oh my god.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117944428200460358 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117944428200460358><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 12, 2023 5:32 PM">5:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Tit for tat, these mental games were played.  Triboulet&#39;s eyes met with the masked grimace of Pagliacci, and she knew without a doubt that this was his game.  &quot;Oh, really?&quot; she said, suppressing a groan.  The man was some kind of bizarre mockery of the proud image of a <em>bouffon,</em> and in more ways than one - his hat was the kind worn by her compatriots from the Holy Roman Empire in a mocking devil&#39;s guise, the mask was properly Italian as his origin would suggest but rendered in incorrect fashion, the bells were attached in the wrong places, his voice actor had an English accent, the sleeves were wrong, he lacked any kind of funny codpiece, he was far too muscular for the job and his colors clashed...in an <em>ugly</em> way, not a humorous way!

Not only was this slight towards her effective, it seemed as if the <em>game&#39;s designers themselves</em> had decided to design the poor fool in as inaccurate of a fashion as possible.  Triboulet had the greater weapon...but Bill had the advantage of numbers.  Goddamn you DataWorld Software!

Triboulet gripped the stick tightly for a moment, looking at that crooked grin of his, and did what she could to control herself.  That is, she drank some more.  She would need to go into this with as clear of a mind as possible, and you need drink for that.

The topic of wager was an obvious one, and she didn&#39;t shy away from an answer.  After a bit of humming to herself as she thought it over, there was only one obvious one.

&quot;Perchance, would you part with <strong>what your Noble Phantasm is?&quot;</strong>  She shrugged.  &quot;&#39;tis not of much importance with the war being over for you, but we&#39;re already so intimately acquainted with one another.

Bill slurped another serving of the shallow, fruity alcohol that they served at the bar. It filled him with enough buzz to match Triboulet&#39;s intensity, the two glaring at each other hard enough for sparks to start flying. Archer tapped at the buttons impatiently while Assassin clenched at the stick. It took a minute of pondering for her to come up with her ideal version of a reward for winning this &#39;fight&#39;.

&quot;My Noble Phantasm? Sure. Not like yer getting it.&quot; Bill sneered, noticing her confidence and promptly deciding to crush it. He then leaned closer as she assumed the sort of reward he had in mind. Surely a Servant would want knowledge of his opponent&#39;s trump card for the future?

&quot;Who gives a rat&#39;s ass about your Noble Phantasm?&quot; He laughed, his mouth smelling foul. &quot;Yer an Assassin, right? Then <strong>lemme hire you.&quot;</strong> He suggested, catching the jester off guard. &quot;Knowing about some stupid Noble Phantasm ain&#39;t gonna help me since I&#39;ll be dead soon.&quot; He grumbled, having a brief moment of clarity. Independent Action could only get him so far, after all. Lachlan would eventually sever the connection and he would vanish from this world. There were only limited opportunities for him to leave his mark, and too many doors to open for such little time left.

&quot;Well, I need some people <em>dead-</em>&quot; The cowboy leaned uncomfortably close, normally towering miles above Triboulet. Instead now he was leaning down, his oversized hat hiding her from everybody else&#39;s view and for his eyes only, like a prized pearl.

&quot;-I also need some <em>alive.</em> Ya following?&quot; He said with his rancid, yet alluring breath. His words were devious and those of a miscreant, yet some part of Triboulet felt like digging deeper. Was this the alcohol dulling her senses and filling her with unnecessary, paranoid thoughts? For him to ask such an odd request, to protect <em>someone</em>, and to get so intimately close, it was-

<strong>FIRST BLOOD!</strong>
<strong>1 HIT!</strong>
<strong>2 HITS!</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118302867888025711 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118302867888025711><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 13, 2023 5:16 PM">5:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Assassin snapped back to her senses, realizing that Bill had been mashing his part of the machine during his entire speech. Pagliacci had taken the first move, spamming some sort of pie jab attack where he would grab a pie from the nether and immediately shove it  a short range ahead of him. It hit Barry effortlessly, having a much faster wind-up and execution time unlike the bear&#39;s slow and powerful strikes. 

&quot;Bahahahah!&quot; Bill laughed, spit landing on Triboulet&#39;s face as he quickly rose up. &quot;The fuck yer doin&#39;? We&#39;ve already started, ye?&quot; He chuckled, tapping half of the buttons with his entire left palm as Pagliacci kept slapping away. The bastard was two-timing her, getting her attention with horrid attitude and then sucker punching her when she least expected it. Asshole!

&quot;Whatevs, we can discuss this after I&#39;ve won. Just keep that mind!&quot; He hollered, taking another sip from his drink as his mind floated in limbo. He had just drunk enough to kill a medium sized elephant, after all. Not that it did anything to stop his mashing.

There was no strategy; just mindless, repetitive mashing of the same move to get as much damage as possible, which was pitiful. After around 10 or so hits, Barry still had 80% of his health left, at least according to the large bar labeled <em>&#39;VAMPIRE LIFE FORCE&#39;</em> on Triboulet&#39;s half of the screen.

&quot;Yeah I&#39;m-<em>yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn</em>-winning this.&quot; Bill reaffirmed to himself as he took a wide (and loud) yawn, much to Tribble&#39;s irritation. He was acting like the match was already over, despite it having just started. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The terms were then actually, for real, agreed to.  Her mind wandered to a number of places as Archer named his terms, as his targets were quite mysterious.  He hated his Master, but to have him killed would most likely be suicide.  Had he ran into someone who he hated all the more?  And that person was someone he either couldn&#39;t kill - Triboulet didn&#39;t imagine him weak, he seemed like a brute in all connotations - or he just didn&#39;t have the time to.  Who could he--

Barry had been betrayed by her thinking, and the only way he could signal his disappointment in her was from his roars of pain from being creampied repeatedly.  Not that Triboulet knew how some dessert could hurt a person.  Maybe there was acid hidden somewhere in that froth.

Triboulet spat a fast &quot;You duplicitous coward!&quot; and tried to mount a defense against these pies, but found no recourse yet.  Her flailing proved that she had to move the stick around to get the bear to move, as the lazy bastard wouldn&#39;t do it on his own accord like she imagined, but she just couldn&#39;t get past the initial hail of projectiles!  Getting into punching distance wasn&#39;t happening if she got knocked back slightly every pie, and punching them out of the air only served to hurt her <em>somehow.</em>

Immediately, Triboulet knew that the creators of this machine game had never been in a fight before if this was their idea of combat.

&quot;Good sirrrr,&quot; she said with a noticeable drunken affect, &quot;do you think you&#39;re goin&#39; to exhaust this clown&#39;s coinpurse if you keep up the pies or what?  Think of the poor man and his family!&quot;  This was silly, but the way she said it made it sound like a real concern of hers.  If this was some kind of automated stage show of combat, did these characters not have lives and a story beyond their war?  <s>or maybe she was just getting really drunk</s></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118581329496387595 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118581329496387595><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 11:42 AM">11:42 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her flailing at least had some uses.  Eventually she found that moving away from the opponent <em>somehow</em> have your player the gumption to raise their arms and defend themselves.  With this she was able to at least keep Pagliacci&#39;s pie fusilade from killing her bear, but there was a timer to this competition - 65 second remaining, and she needed to impress the judges!  Judging was part of this, right?  She started throwing out random commands and tried to keep in mind what they did between pie throws - little punch, kick, big punch, up left down...

Without warning, Barry threw his massive ursine arms to the sides and twirled around at speed, performing a classical spinning lariat that caught Pagliacchi completely off guard and sent him to the air!  Triboulet celebrated his action by saying &quot;What the fuck?&quot; and then was quick to perform the exact same series of random inputs as a second before.  Lo and behold, Barry did it again...and in doing so, he caught Pagliacci a second time after he bounded off the invisible wall of the stage!

Thank you, Lord, for a muscle memory that has uses beyond tying knots and pulling off dumb magic tricks!

&quot;Ahaha!&quot;  Triboulet stamped the floor in delight as the turnabout came around.  &quot;Your weak pies mean nothing compared to this whirlwind of furred muscle!  Eat shit!&quot;  She didn&#39;t let up from there, as when Pagliacci came down to the ground she was already there to meet him, and she started to press buttons with a more directed, less mashy mind.

Pagliacci&#39;s life-bar started to drain faster than Barry&#39;s, for there was no one to contend with Barry&#39;s raw power!  A shame that certain events would conspire to change the course of history and prevent fighting game tier lists from becoming popular, as this bear would surely be up near the top.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118581376422264932 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118581376422264932><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 11:43 AM">11:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With Pagliacci backed into the corner and Triboulet <strong>actually trying something besides button mashing,</strong> things were looking grim for the clown and his unseen master.

His victory seemed imminent. Soon he would-

<strong>5 HITS!</strong>

The bear brought back the fangs to fighting. By that, it meant that Barry had a special move under his sleeve. Literally. Some sort of lariat move was unlocked by Triboulet, who had figured it out by pressing certain combinations of buttons together. Said move beat the pies with ease, constantly hitting over Pagliacci and punishing him for mindless mashing. Bill&#39;s character was being pushed towards the very end of the screen, right in the corner!

Assassin&#39;s gloating shrills were what caused Bill to snap. &quot;Shut up! That&#39;s fucking cheap!&quot; He snarled, despite being fine with spamming moves himself. Triboulet wasn&#39;t even mashing buttons; she patiently waited for Bill to slip up, since the cowboy had caught on to Triboulet&#39;s little &#39;blocking&#39; trick. Anytime she saw his stick move forward, she immediately countered by performing the lariat. It was a surefire way to victory.

&quot;If only this stupid ass clown had a gun-&quot; Bill complained like a sore loser, watching the utter ridiculous scene of his character being pummeled by Barry the Canadian icon. 50 seconds were left on the clock and Pagliacci had only half of his health left. Archer&#39;s focus had hit its lowest point, causing him to resort to an emergency drink as he snapped his fingers and received a refill. He drank it down in one gulp, something that should normally make his vision foggy, but instead cleared up his mind.

The best thing you could do with a gun, in fact, the <strong>only important</strong> thing you could do with a gun, was to <strong>take aim.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118700376464576552 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118700376464576552><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 7:35 PM">7:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
So Pagliacci just stood there and took it. He kept holding down block, much to Tribble&#39;s surprise. The timer gradually went down and even though Pagliacci wasn&#39;t taking any damage, he wasn&#39;t getting any damage in either. He was down on life and Bill had the hunch that the timer wasn&#39;t there just for show. The thought of it reaching 0 sounded ominous to him, so he&#39;d rather avoid that.

Assassin was most likely overflowing with confidence at this point. Her opponent was cornered and Bill looked as fidgety as a mouse. He looked a lot more appealing when he was quiet and humbled. Perhaps a full-on reeducation wouldn&#39;t be too hard if he got pummeled enough times...

But then, Bill finally made his move. He had watched Barry&#39;s moves a billion times by now, noticing any gap in the animal&#39;s movements. Anytime he performed the lariat, there was a brief second of downtime at the very end of it.

He blocked the next lariat. And then, once the very last hit had ended, he pushed the stick to the right and started mashing like crazy.

<strong>&quot;YER GONNA LEARN TODAY!&quot;</strong> Bill shouted triumphantly, throwing more pies.

<strong>1 HIT</strong>
<strong>2 HITS</strong>
<strong>3 HITS</strong>

This seemed like such a waste. All he was doing was repeating the same jab type attacks, but a jab didn&#39;t knock a character down unlike a lariat, nor did it deal any significant amount of damage. Once Bill&#39;s &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;combo&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ended, Barry would once again be able to pummel him with another lariat-

<em>taptaptaptaptaptaptap</em>

Of course Bill knew that, so he immediately started mashing all buttons at once and spinning his stick around like crazy. He had clearly taken some inspiration from Assassin&#39;s own movements, but overdid it like usual. Typical toxic and overcompensating masculinity at work here. What was he trying to achieve-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118700387243937883 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118700387243937883><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 7:35 PM">7:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>FWOOOOSH!</strong>

A strange sound effect played, followed by the screen temporarily going black as sparks of light surrounded Pagliacci. A brief cutscene played, showing Pagliacci getting into a miniature clown car with ease. He then proceeded to drive it forward, ramming through Barry and sending the bear flying. Several clowns then emerged from the car with bats and lead pipes in hand. They proceeded to beat him up severely before vanishing into smoke as Pagliacci honked his own nose in the meanwhile.

<strong>4 HITS</strong>
<strong>8 HITS</strong>
<strong>24 HITS</strong>
<strong>SUPER COMBO!!! 30000 PTS</strong>

It happened in a flash. Barry&#39;s health was now just slivers away from being black, while some blue bar underneath Pagliacci&#39;s health was now suddenly empty. They now had only 30 seconds on the clock.

&quot;LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; Bill screamed in delighted, jumping up and down repeatedly as he poured alcohol all over his face. &quot;I told ya! I goddamn told ya! Ya mess with the best ya see what happens?!&quot; The cowboy hollered as he ordered another drink. He had no idea on what that just happened, but he chalked it up to moving stick + pressing buttons randomly = good. None of the sophisticated learning that Assassin had done.

To be almost beaten by such a caveman strategist made Assassin almost want to reconsider her life choices. The saving grace was the fact that the match hadn&#39;t ended yet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118700422094393394 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118700422094393394><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 7:36 PM">7:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The two were also oblivious to it at the moment, but due to the sheer amount of noise, booze and their gaudy little outfits, the Servant pair had attracted quite the amount of attention inside the building. People couldn&#39;t tell who they were, only that they were apparently having a &#39;grudge match&#39; of some sorts. It was in moments like these where people would sit back, have a nice drink or two and enjoy betting on players like horses. Triboulet&#39;s sense of humor was still a hit, despite the booze devolving her to a common animal. Bill&#39;s exaggerated swagger and confidence was also something that a lot of people could root for. As a result, it wasn&#39;t a surprise for a small gathering of fans to surround the arcade machine, eager to see how things played out. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Keep up that block, Bill, don&#39;t want to see your precious fake clown get mauled to death!

Triboulet&#39;s game was set now; she knew how to lariat, she had at least some idea about the distance of her strikes, all that was left was to keep the pressure.  Genteel duels of earlier times oft ended like this, with one side beaten down but left alive and made a fool of.  Whether it was rapiers or bear claws, she&#39;d take this first duel of her life in convincing fashion!  More and more, each strike took chips off the enemy&#39;s Bar of Fighting Spirit - Triboulet shouted &quot;Learn to fight, you fuckin&#39; milksop!&quot;

This was a perfect time for him to break her serve.  The bear recoiled, pies were thrown, and Triboulet groaned.  &quot;Keep it up, you worm,&quot; she shouted over the cartoon pie sounds and obnoxious bear growls, &quot;you&#39;re impressing no one with that manner of cheap maneu--holy Christ, what?  Where did tha--&quot;

Once the initial strike had gotten past her, no matter what she did, it seemed like Barry&#39;s fate had been sealed.  She couldn&#39;t block, she couldn&#39;t mount an offense, Barry simply sat there and took the beating like a good fool!  Initially she was left with disbelief with nothing going on, but now she wasn&#39;t just annoyed...Triboulet was fucking furious.  &quot;Oh FUCK YOU,&quot; she pulled herself up with her elbows and back down, rocking around in her anger, &quot;you&#39;re not the best at anything!  &#39;tis cheating!  You&#39;re a goddamned cheat!  I was PRESSING BUTTONS and NOTHING HAPPENED, how in any Christian world is that fair!?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118974488198008925 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118974488198008925><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 1:45 PM">1:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>ass1 Amazingly, the enemy clown squad didn&#39;t see fit to murder him outright, leaving Barry just bear-ly alive.  Assassin imagined it was some sort of perverse chivalry, to give the leader of the gang the grace of the last strike in the fight.  She didn&#39;t really care though, these clowns were just cheap as hell, and this left her salty an unhealthy degree.  &quot;I&#39;ll snap off this stick and shove it somewhere so that <strong>the only way you&#39;re going to be able to play this game is on the latrine,</strong> you animal!  Cheat like that again and I&#39;ll make you WISH you were being beaten to death with a pipe!&quot;

Triboulet&#39;s game was clearly thrown off terribly now, and while she wasn&#39;t deprived of her good sense enough to lose the lariat, she wasn&#39;t focused enough to do much more than try and unga-bunga beat down Bill and his annoying clown.  This poor sportsmanship wasn&#39;t going to win awards, but it did win a crowd.  She really would prefer if they were here for, I don&#39;t know, anything besides seeing her ass get beat while soused, but she wasn&#39;t in a position to choose.

Eventually, chip damage and chip damage and chip damage managed to bring Pagliacci closer to Barry&#39;s level, and one blocked kick put them at distance - Triboulet had no idea how getting blocked would send the <em>attacker</em> backwards, but nothing in this awful game made sense!  With seconds left on the match and Bill&#39;s mean stall having the upper hand here, Triboulet tried her most desperate tactic.

She ALSO pressed buttons randomly.

There was a flash and a burst of color from the hero of Canada, and suddenly an entire log appeared in his paws!  Triboulet&#39;s anger turned into hateful glee, for she&#39;d get to see Bill squirm uselessly as he was finally defeated with the...

...

...he...blocked it.

...and then Bill threw out one pie as Triboulet stood there, dumbfounded.

The crowd around them had managed to absorb most everyone in the arcade into its fold, and even brought in questioning onlookers from the street who saw the crowd.  The owner of this bar had no complaints beyond the constant drunk swearing from both of these two, because the two of them were buying more drinks in one hour than he&#39;d expect to sell in days!  By this point, he was even taking bets under the table from the older patrons - the odds were close to even, as though Bill had the record right now, Triboulet had learned.

This gauntlet of war had forged a fighter out of this mere fool.  Rounds were given away for experimentation, new moves were discovered, the concept of overheads was realized, and she even managed to pull off that super where Barry throws the opponent down a log flue!  

But the real end of their war loomed closer and closer: Triboulet was <em>really</em> out of it now.  She only could use this knowledge when the haze in her drunken mind cleared up slightly.  She leaned against the front of the cabinet for support, grasping at stick and buttons in an uncomfortable posture.  What was a series of violent threats and insults had mostly just turned into random swearing at this point.

As it stood then, 37 seconds remained in the round.  Triboulet was up, and she was at least lucid enough to keep blocking whatever spamming that Bill threw her way, but it was close enough that one combo could presumably end it all...and then we&#39;d see if the loser could keep any more alcohol down.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill was having the time of his life. This was far better than any game of Poker, Blackjack or darts he had ever experienced. His gang members were usually no match for him, either because he was good or because he cheated. Plus they often got kicked out of saloons once people realized who they really were. Being a Servant with no shackles to the mortal realm any longer, he was allowed to enjoy himself freely. To play with a huge audience behind him. To get drunk like no tomorrow. He had even been gifted a proper opponent: A little, impish midget of a Servant, but one that could actually keep up with his line of stupidity.

Was this the &#39;life&#39; he had been looking for? Exuberant bliss and decadent pleasure? Nothing but mindless entertainment as he wasted his days away?

No. This was enjoyable, but it wasn&#39;t because of the modern commodities, nor was it because of the loud crowd around him. They were strangers, just like the rest of the Cook gang. He was their reliable enforcer, but could barely remember their faces. Not like the history books cared about them either. What made this moment so special then?

...

He shook his head, snapping back to reality as his opponent was acting like a brick wall: Triboulet&#39;s defense had improved since the past 10 sets or so. She knew that there was more to this game than just holding back. Overheads, grabs, lows, she had learned every trick in the book to survive Bill&#39;s onslaught. He was still mashing, but he had learned to mash <em>correctly.</em> Certain buttons did different things and combinations of buttons did <em>very</em> different things. He had figured out that much throughout their rounds.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119397453146357821 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119397453146357821><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 5:45 PM">5:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But to tell the truth, what carried him was not tactics, but pure instinct. His mind was a drunken haze at this point, on his 69th glass through a combination of losses and personal pleasure. Even though he was the one who had proposed the drink-and-fight competition, he was much worse off due to drinking far more than necessary. He smelled, he burped and he looked grumpy as fuck. Tribble&#39;s swearing didn&#39;t help, but at this point it sounded so nonsensical and vapid that he just laughed at how ridiculous it was.

This was fun. So very fun. He felt tempted to say that it surpassed the feeling of holding a gun, but he couldn&#39;t confirm it yet. After all,

<strong>he had yet to win.</strong> Winning was what showed whether you truly loved something or not.

&quot;Gimme a break.&quot; Bill shouted, 30 seconds on the clock as Pagliacci&#39;s punch-in-a-box special had failed to break Barry&#39;s defenses. Instead, he was now minus on block, resulting in Triboulet punishing him with a quick slash. This could lead to a combo-

&quot;Get outta there with that crap!&quot; The cowboy snarled, slamming the machine as he tilted his stick into a backdash, dodging the next blow before it could land. Sensing the ever shifting tide, Triboulet immediately retreated as well, back into the corner with her safe blocks. The bear stood tall and proud, ready to catch all sort of attacks.

25 seconds left, and now Pagliacci was on death&#39;s threshold thanks to that wicked punish from Barry. One combo. Just one, clean, non dropped combo would end it all. Neither of them were in a state to do it, both irritated, tired, drunk out of their minds and worst of all, <em>entertained.</em> When was the last time they could swing themselves at someone with abandon?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119397485614481499 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119397485614481499><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 5:45 PM">5:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Perhaps that line of thought is why Bill kept moving forward. He snapped his fingers, tempting fate as he had now completely buried Triboulet&#39;s funds with all the drinks that he had purchased. A nice little domino tower of glasses rested beneath his feet, thanks to him continuously ordering new drinks when he had yet to finish his old one.

Just like the rest of them, a new glass emerged, filled with brown and viscous liquid. He swallowed it in one gulp, chewing and crunching on the ice as his eyes fired up. He used what little brainpower he had coupled with the mountain of grit he had left. The crowd went silent, watching the screen be completely immobile save for the timer. Triboulet was focused on defense while Bill had just stopped moving altogether. 5 seconds had passed.

<em>&quot;Are ya ready to lose?&quot;</em> Bill asked with a drunken giggle, confident in his victory as he saw the winning line. To be more accurate, he just felt it. A gut feeling telling him to go with it. He pushed his stick, walked forward and mashed his buttons.

And truly <em>mashed</em> them.

&quot;Nyeheheheheh!&quot; Pagliacci laughed as the brought things full circle. Bill&#39;s grand strategy was to...start spamming pies at Barry yet again. It was stupid, laughable, pathetic even. Triboulet could just ask a scarecrow to hold block for her and she would still win! Was this the winning strategy Archer had envisioned? What a laugh!

Though, she did notice Pagliacci glowing yellow here and there. The clown was enhancing its pies at the cost of meter every few jabs, though this move could be blocked as well. However, it dealt damage. Very, <em>very</em> small amounts of chip damage.

The problem was that Bill had a <em>shit ton</em> of meter left over from mashing ever since Triboulet went on the defensive. The life difference between the two wasn&#39;t too bad either. If Bill was trying to lame her out with chip damage in an effort to win by timer...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119397518938210404 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119397518938210404><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 5:46 PM">5:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
That idiot. There was no way this could work! After all, the enhanced pie throw had a critical weakness: It was a lot <em>slower.</em> All Triboulet needed to do was to patiently wait for Bill to throw one out and then counter with a bite, a claw or even a super. It would have been over in a flash.

An anticlimax, but some theater plays were fond of subverting expectations. She could tell Bill all about the literary trope once she was done scrubbing his ass off the floor.

The moment Pagliacci threw a stronger pie attack, the screen went black as Barry was surrounded by sparks and fighting spirit. He was about to use his log Super Move! Triboulet could practically taste the victory on her lips-

&quot;C&#39;mon...<strong>HIT ME!&quot;</strong> Bill slammed down his controls, referring not only to Triboulet, but to the bartender who was serving up another glass. The super was about to hit and instead of frantically trying to block, he took that precious split second to gulp down another glass instead. The crowd gasped in disbelief. Even Assassin thought she was dreaming. This was the behavior of a true fool. What could this moron be thinking?

...

He remembered it ever since he was little. When the older kids bullied him for his looks, his upbringing, his total lack of <strong>guts.</strong> Any attempt to better himself constantly ended with a beatdown, a defeat, a shocking incident that made him retreat under his shell and never dare to see the sun again. Looking for shortcuts was attractive. Hiding under the covers felt safe.

But ever since he grabbed the gun, those gears changed. No matter what, he wanted to see things through the end. Even if others told him no. Even if the entire world told him no. Even if people told him that something was impossible, or unachievable, or even immoral, he wanted to do it.

That was his definition of <strong>guts.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119397580405735434 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119397580405735434><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 5:46 PM">5:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

&quot;This shitty ass game sure loves rewarding people who just cower behind and keep holding back.&quot; Bill blurted out, half trying to intimidate and half just drunk out of his mind. &quot;But sorry midget, <strong>I&#39;m gonna beat yer ass anyway!&quot;</strong>

Bill immediately mashed all buttons. He rolled the stick as well. The screen went dark again as Pagliacci brought back the iconic clown car: The same Super from Round 1.

He was going to clash their Supers together?! What even happened in those scenarios? Would the game even allow it?!? The crowd went wild, some of them having never considered this situation till now. They chanted loudly, calling the two by fan made nicknames in their own language as they rooted for their respective favorites.

Bill didn&#39;t care. He just grinned at the screen and leaned forward, continuously mashing. It was his way of saying <em>&#39;one way to find out, right?&#39;</em>

<strong>2 HITS</strong>
<strong>COUNTER HIT</strong>
<strong>6 HITS</strong>
<strong>COUNTER HIT</strong>
<strong>COUNTER HIT</strong>
<strong>COUNTER HIT</strong>
<strong>STUN!</strong>

Barry&#39;s Super was more of a projectile type, while Pagliacci&#39;s Super was like an animated movie almost. Maybe it was because of this that both attacks landed, dealing heavy loads of damage. Barry&#39;s Super had unfortunately hit less than expected, part of Pagliacci&#39;s animations conveniently dodging the brunt of its force. The bear wasn&#39;t so lucky, having taking the full damage of a clown car filled with killer klowns. He only had around a sliver of health left while Pagliacci could probably take two more hits.

The victor was obvious though: Pagliacci had been <strong>stunned.</strong> That was the best part about the bear&#39;s Super: It stunned on demand! Triboulet had used it to gain most of her wins, since it essentially led to a huge chunk of damage on its own.

10 seconds were on the clock. Just one jab. Just one more jab! One more jab from Barry and that ugly clown would kick the bucket! Triboulet&#39;s body ached for her to go for it. It ached for her to match Bill&#39;s intensity, but-

Assassin suddenly felt a strong weight on her shoulders, far stronger than any form of gravitational magic or life sucking curse. It was like an elephant had landed on her poor petite body. If she were to turn her neck left, with what little strength she could muster in her drunkenness, she would realize who the culprit was: Bill.

Archer had fallen unconscious, completely blacked out from the amount of drinks he had taken. This was a first, especially for a Servant. The bastard was even snoring!

Worst of all, he was so goddamn heavy! She couldn&#39;t hold him up, especially not in her current state. Her hands juggled between holding the stick and Bill&#39;s needlessly large pecs. Eventually, the cowboy meat won out, forcing Assassin down as she fell off the arcade machine and down to the floor. She could hear the ticking of the timer in her head, slowly counting down to 3, 2, 1...

<strong>TIME OUT</strong>
<strong>PAGLIACCI WINS!</strong>

<em>&quot;I won! A-mamma-mia!&quot;</em>

That clown. That fucking clown. She wanted to butcher that character and that atrocious sound byte, but first she had to get off, which was easier said than done: Bill had completely trapped her, keeping her squished on the floor as he snored louder than a horse&#39;s neigh. She could even see signs of drooling on him, making her forever grateful that he wore a mask.

A few seconds later, he snorted as his brow furrowed. Finally, a sign of consciousness! Could he be waking up?

&quot;Nghhh....Five more minutes, <em>mommy.&quot;</em> Bill blurted out, filling Assassin with embarrassment. Archer had most likely already gone to dreamland, leaving Triboulet to deal with the awkwardness of his past memories. Even worse was the crowd surrounding the two, wondering on what was going on. This day was just <em>great</em>. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

At all. In fact, &#39;<em>elusive</em>&#39; hardly seemed to be an appropriate term anymore, considering that every stall Roland approached had the owners eagerly describing a masked man and a midget wreaking some sort of havoc in the markets. The breadcrumbs left behind by the Archer were practically the size of Pyg itself, guiding Roland to the end of the trail where he found himself standing before...

★   <strong>MAGIC WORLD ARCADE AND DRINK</strong>  ☆

Roland palmed his face. <em>Of course.</em> He <em>did</em> notice Bill&#39;s eyes linger on this fine establishment a solid 3 seconds longer than any other building while they were towing Pyg away. It hadn&#39;t registered at the time, but now, as he entered the building and engulfed himself in the scent of perspiring individuals battling it out on gaming and gambling machines while guzzling alcohol like primitive beings... Suddenly, he understood the appeal.

This was the epitome of wilderness. Bill would feel right at home here.

Roland slackened his tie and walked into the store.

Immediately, his eyes were drawn to the uproar in the arcade section. A crowd that was large enough to fill an entire underground idol performance venue had congregated around a machine embellished with the blazing sign <em><strong>&#39;The World Fightblast Tournament EXTREME Maxxi-Boost&#39;</strong></em>. And buried deep within the sea of people, sprawled on the ground and snoring away like a bear in hibernation, was none other than—

<strong>&#39;BILL!&#39;</strong>

Roland hadn&#39;t even bothered with a nickname. After all, &#39;Archer&#39; would sound far more out of place in their current setting. An average joe name like &#39;Bill&#39;, on the other hand, blended in seamlessly. Roland squeezed himself through the crowd. After enduring a few stepped-on shoes and narrowly avoiding being tossed aside by a burly shoulder, he finally arrived at the center.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119561389611167795 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119561389611167795><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 4:37 AM">4:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;Wake up,&#39; Roland bent down beside the unconscious Archer and slapped his cheeks. He jostled the man—or, at least, attempted to. Goodness, Bill was as heavy as a bear too.

&#39;Wake up,&#39; he said again, raising his voice proportionately. Bill let out a groan and mumbled something about <em>mommy</em>.

Roland draped his tie over one shoulder. Rolled up his sleeves, first the left arm, then the right. He scanned his surroundings: beer bottles scattered all over the machines. <em>Perfect.</em> 

He got to work right away. With an armful of empty bottles in tow, Roland approached the slumbering Archer once more and raised the collection over his head.

<strong>&#39;WAKE UP!&#39;</strong>

The bottles came crashing down onto the Archer&#39;s head. Roland shouted over the surprised gasps from the crowd. 

Just another day at the office.

The pancaked figure beneath the hulking form of the Archer had gone entirely unnoticed.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 4:42 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119561449157697546 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119561449157697546><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 4:37 AM">4:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Can&#39;t let the man here get <em>too</em> rich and grow soft, aye?  For every glass Bill pounded back, Triboulet&#39;s wasn&#39;t far behind, though she took to sipping them instead of downing in one gulp - with how much pressure Pagliacci could put in the corner, there were long stretches that would entail holding back and alternating between high and low block, and she could drink with leisure.  Some leisure, at least.

By this point she had started to understand the game and the positions of the fighters.  Pagliacci&#39;s gimmicks and projectile game were unmatched, especially considering Barry&#39;s only answer to the latter was his Level 1 super, but he didn&#39;t have as hot of defense against aerials and okizeme (not that Triboulet knew any of those terms).  Despite his bulk, Barry could leap and command the air with impunity as long as the clown didn&#39;t come up and start doing his dumb balloon trick bullshit.  It would be decided if she could weather this storm of pies, and...

...he&#39;s going for it?  A naked, nearly full-screen super?!  In the most French she&#39;d ever get, she shouted a violent <em>&quot;Mon Dieu, esp&#232;ce d&#39;imb&#233;cile!&quot;</em>

Triboulet was almost too stupefied to react, almost.  She figured she was just going to power through even more of his stalling nonsense, but he was going for a suicidal move at full screen!  From her perspective, the world moved at a halted pace as she watched the clown car advance across the screen, pixel by pixel.  It was just going to be a matter of hitting the clown in the head right before he can drive up to her, and hopefully take the fucking head off in the process...

Or.  Or!  She could destroy him in style.

She had an audience, even if it was a profane and undignified show and she was the butt of half the jokes.  Why not give them a satisfying ending?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119671996544995478 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119671996544995478><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 11:56 AM">11:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet, her fingers mercurial, pulled out her own super with the expectation that it would intercept his at range.  The log cleared most of the screen and it was obviously meant to crush at a distance, so why shouldn&#39;t it--why <strong>DIDN&#39;T</strong> it intercept?!  Once again left without any control in hand, she watched as Pagliacci&#39;s bullshit unbalanced car just sailed through it all, the same joker bastards walked out to beat her bear up, and everything repeated itself!  Time is a unicycle and Triboulet has to balance its tiny wheel lest she fall face-first!  There was a scream of great frustration, as she had been cheated out of another victory.  She was left with...

...just a little more fight left in her?  There was a dream-like moment as she glided across the screen unbothered, the clown stuck in a daze as she watched the on-screen clown in a similar daze.  It was going to be just one h--

<em>thump</em>

Triboulet was pressed down with enough force from above that her right hand was pushed off of the buttons, and the world became dark.  This brought her sauced mind back to the reality she was in for a moment, a panic as she tried to make sense of what was going on, and she pressed through the black night to stick her head out and look up.  It was...it was a sleepy bastard.  The crowd was cheering, the music was louder than ever, and here this Cherokee cockhead was...taking a fine nap.  Why, she was so upset at his poor gamesmanship that she barely realized to try to move before Bill moved her.

Now laid flat on the worn tile floor, the scent of used gum and alcohol mixing with the aroma of this abused bum, the assassin gagged and gasped for breath.  There was the rage of being denied a victory, yes, but the more immediate issue of having her body being crushed to death...</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 11:57 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119672173758521374 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119672173758521374><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 11:57 AM">11:57 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>When Roland arrived, there was a sense of confusion among the crowd - not so much directed towards him and his apparent familiarity with the drunken colossus who had taken the fighting game world by storm, but towards the fact that both of the people they bet on had fallen at the exact same time.  Some argued it was a tie, some said that the girl had touched the ground first, others said that the tall one had clearly gone unconscious before he even left the cabinet.  The bar&#39;s owner and impromptu bookie had the strange position of not even being sure what people were expecting from him, because this was a fighting game match and not a literal wrestling bout.

Roland&#39;s tactic of, hopefully, killing Bill by breaking his skull into pieces with a waterfall of glasses at least afforded Triboulet enough of a jolt to free herself...slightly.  One hand shot out from underneath his bulk, and with no better answer, the owner declared that she had (somehow) won the bets related to who would go unconscious first...while also silently handing out cash to those who were betting more on match record than resolution.

&quot;Just...ughh...<strong>kill</strong> this damn cow,&quot; said a voice from beneath Bill, slurred but unmistakably Francophonic to Roland&#39;s ears, &quot;hit him harder...right &#39;tween his neck and the back of his skull!  That&#39;ll wake him up...&quot;

Triboulet slid out just enough, aided by the slickness of his alcohol-covered body, to get a good look at Roland.  From his perspective, it probably looked like he was crushing some kid who had just gone through the most wild night of drinking in her life - bleary eyed, hair a mess, mouth turned toward a wobbly leer.

&quot;...what are you waiting for, pull him off of me!&quot; she barked at the poor, overworked soul.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Constantly got out of hairy situations where a lesser man would have been dead. One such tale even talked about him getting hit in the back of the head with a large, steel fire poker, and that didn&#39;t even knock him out!

<em>CRASH!</em>

After seeing Bill&#39;s reaction to bottles hitting the back of his skull, Roland could believe it. He knew that Servants were durable, but he didn&#39;t expect Archer to just shrug it off with yet another snore! Indeed, Bill remained on the floor, groaning and drooling like someone who just had an alarm clock thrown at them. Like any responsible adult, he had kicked it back into snooze instead of actually getting up. 

&quot;Piss off, mom!&quot; Bill shouted in his sleep, grabbing for metaphorical blankets. One wondered how his own mother could tolerate him with that language, but then again he wouldn&#39;t be an outlaw otherwise. Triboulet didn&#39;t care about his issues, focused more on being suffocated to death as she ordered Roland to massacre the sorry sack of an Archer. Unfortunately for her, her valiant attempt to escape simply made Bill think that she was the soft bed in his dream.

&quot;No! I don&#39;t wanna go-!&quot; One could sense that Bill was either going to finish off with <em>&#39;school&#39;</em> or <em>&#39;dentist&#39;</em> or something in-between. It didn&#39;t matter. What mattered was him lunging and clawing forward, before grasping at Assassin once again and hugging at her tightly like the mattress she was supposed to be. It was physically suffocating and mentally exhausting. She was a jester, not a courtesan! Bill&#39;s size, his mumbling and the horrid stench of a drunkard were just the icing on this shit pile of a cake.

Thankfully for her, she was small. So small that not even Bill&#39;s dream could figure out why his mattress felt so thin and gangly. He grasped for sections of it that weren&#39;t there, before his brain rationalized it as the mattress being gone, that he was falling into a bottomless void-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119787777215701122 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119787777215701122><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 7:36 PM">7:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;AH!&quot; He screamed himself awake. Seemed like even Servants were guilty of having that particular dream. The cowboy rubbed his eyes open, still feeling seven feet under thanks to his binge drinking. He then realized that he was staring down at the floor, just inches away from the face of a pissed off Triboulet. Instead of getting off and apologizing for forcing himself on a lady, however-

&quot;The <em>hell</em> do ya think <em>yer</em> doin&#39;?!&quot; He shouted in her face, spit raining down her cheeks. &quot;Tryna off me while I&#39;m asleep?! Fucking <em>low</em> of you.&quot; He snarled. His torso then rose up, sitting on his knees as he stared at shards of glass on his hat and coat. He turned around, noticing that the pale kid, Roland, had joined in.

Wait, Roland? Why was he-

&quot;And the <em>hell</em> are <em>you</em> doin&#39; here?!&quot; Bill shouted, gargling words and filled with jitters as he pointed to Lachlan&#39;s lapdog. &quot;Ya here to tell me my time&#39;s up? That&#39;s it?!&quot; He snarled, hissing like a snake that had been found in the watering hole.

<em>&quot;He</em> can&#39;t even bother doing it on his own, huh? At least fire me in person, coward.&quot; Bill growled. It was clear who he was referring to, though Assassin would be somewhat clueless on the details. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His wake-up call had worked, as unconventional (read: suicidal) as it was from an outsider&#39;s perspective. After all, who in their right mind would resort to smashing someone&#39;s head open to rouse them from their slumber?

Oh, if only they knew the nature of the <em>beast</em> Roland was dealing with...

Surely, Bill, being the Knight class Servant that he was, would shrug off the incident effortlessly. Even if he woke up now, he wouldn&#39;t suspect a thing. Roland could easily play it off as if he had just arrived. The shattered glass strewn about? Simply a result of gravity doing its fine work. Ab-so-lutely.

&#39;Alright. Break it up, nothing to see here.&#39; Roland reassured the onlookers with a composed expression, doing his best to imitate the demeanor of an exasperated office work slave. &#39;Just another day in the life for our friend here,&#39; he continued to soothe the crowd. &#39;The boss wants him back, caught him slacking.&#39;

He smiled, offering the most agreeable grin he could muster. The crowd chuckled. &#39;Give him a break!&#39; They jested.

&#39;It&#39;s the desert heat,&#39; Roland said pleasantly, even though it was the middle of winter. He took a step back as Bill began to stir, excuses at the ready...

But then, something unexpected happened. A head emerged, only that it wasn&#39;t from under Bill&#39;s hat, but from directly underneath Bill himself. A small figure began to struggle in earnest, first unleashing a hail of profanities towards Bill, then demanding Roland&#39;s assistance in freeing herself from this literal bear trap.

Roland was aghast. Never in his life could he have imagined Bill getting into a feud with a kid. Was he twelve? Even Lachlan had more self-restraint than this!

Chaos ensued.

To say that Roland had been thrown into the midst of a raging fire would be an understatement. As soon as Bill&#39;s eyes locked onto his target, he unleashed a barrage of verbal abuse, first at the girl, then at Roland. Flecks of spittle flew in Roland&#39;s direction, and it took immense mental fortitude for Roland to not bolt right out of there.

<em>Stay composed...</em> he told himself. <em>He&#39;s mad drunk right now...happens to the best of us.</em>

Unfortunately for him, Bill was on his <em>worst</em> behavior at the moment. So raving mad was he, that even some of the dispersing crowd had returned to relish in the gossip.

Roland wished he could disappear into the ground.

But, he held his ground. Counted to ten. Then twenty. Let the barking dogs bark, or however that saying went. He decided to let Bill tire himself out with his shouting, and in the meantime...

&#39;Sorry about that.&#39;

Roland knelt in front of Triboulet. Fishing around in his pockets, he retrieved...a handful of banknotes, and a packet of gum.

He pressed the items into Triboulet&#39;s hands.

&#39;Here,&#39; he patted the girl on her hand, ensuring that his bribe was securely placed. &#39;Go buy yourself some tokens and forget about all this, alright? Or, even better,&#39; he tilted his head and gestured towards the exit of the establishment, &#39;there&#39;s a much more suitable arcade down the street. <em><strong>Fun-tastic Playland</strong></em> or something like that. You&#39;ll find it if you look.&#39;

&#39;Anyway. Don&#39;t get involved with him,&#39; Roland jerked his thumb back at Bill. &#39;He&#39;s a terrible influence for a young lady like you.&#39;

With a pat on Triboulet&#39;s head, Roland straightened himself and shifted his focus to Lachlan&#39;s Servant.

&#39;First things first, quiet down!&#39; He held up a finger in front of his mouth. &#39;Haven&#39;t you had enough? Do you want the entire <em>street</em> to become aware of your presence? Being a magnet for attention isn&#39;t part of your trade!&#39;

He grabbed hold of Bill&#39;s outstretched finger and pulled him along. Or, at least, he tried. 

&#39;YES,&#39; he said firmly. &#39;I&#39;m here to take you back. Why on earth did you think it was a good idea to leave Lachy by himself? You have no idea, do you?&#39; He searched the Archer&#39;s inebriated eyes for a trace of comprehension, and when he found none, an unnamed fire kindled in the pit of his stomach.

&#39;You have no idea!&#39; He said angrily. <strong>&#39;You have no idea!&#39;</strong> He wanted to bonk Archer on the head, but, fearing retribution, snatched another empty bottle from a nearby machine and hurled it at the wall.

&#39;Lachy&#39;s going to <em>die</em> because <em>you</em> decided to run off and...and...&#39; He pointed a shaky finger at Triboulet. &#39;Engage in a childish brawl with some random kid!&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 8:34 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119982885668134922 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119982885668134922><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 8:32 AM">8:32 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Seriously, here he was having some kind of weird Freudian dream as she was being crushed to death, and then she&#39;s the villain?  If it weren&#39;t for the crowd, she&#39;d have done far worse.  Even drunk, Triboulet has limits.

With breathing room afforded, she lazily scooted away from him before sitting upright, grabbing the edge of the adjacent <em>Dig Dug</em> machine for support as she rose.  Triboulet was given a show now, at least - Bill had some familiar company in the form of that greasy looking kid.  At first she imagined Roland to be his Master, but it was right after that it became obvious that she was looking at some other underling.  Good thing too, if things got worse then his neck would&#39;ve been on the line.  What Triboulet saw in him, now, was just some beleaguered soul.  &quot;Oh, Bill, give him the slightest break.  It&#39;s not a surprise you&#39;re going to be fired if you never shoulda been hired in the first place, eheh...&quot;

And that was going to be just fine, until Roland sought to ameliorate the situation.

She stood there, and felt some warmth both from his hand and his kind words as she was lectured.  It could&#39;ve been restitution, or a bribe, but she stared at him blankly regardless as she was paid off for her unfortunate encounter with the outlaw, her stance still uneven.  &quot;Wh-wha...&quot; was her only response at first, before she was silenced by the most severe of coynesses: the <em>head-pat.</em>  That same warm hand jostled her messed-up hair, and her eyes went wide.  She was brought down from a soul worthy of respect in at least the eyes of one person in this room, to just some innocent bystander who could be let go with some basic affection and...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120067699658199040 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120067699658199040><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 2:09 PM">2:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...she didn&#39;t even know what the gum was, so she kind of assumed it was some tobacco in a foil wrapper.  Real...flat tobacco.  Her mind wasn&#39;t all there, forgive her.

Now, as Roland turned his back on her to give Bill some actual backbone (good on you, Roland!), she had all right and ability to make some sensible choices.  Unless this random churl had the confidence of a gladiator, which might be the case with how much business he&#39;s giving Archer over there, she was basically a non-entity at this point.  She could walk out, leave Bill to his pitiful fate, and no one would know - hell, she could probably use this public distraction, as there were still plenty of gawkers around them, to steal back her drinking money and come out of this only SOMEWHAT broke.  Roland&#39;s arrival had been nothing short of a blessing, and it would be sensible to take this gift, find out what gum was, go home to James, and tell him about the very maddening adventure she had today.  All would be well.

Triboulet was drunk, though.  To compound that inebriation, she was also <em>fucking pissed</em> about...pretty much everything right now.

To think that normally, she&#39;d be the kind of person you&#39;d call a &#39;happy drunk&#39;...

The final straw was Roland&#39;s final instance of bringing her down to the level of a child, which she fixed thusly.  He&#39;d feel the <em>whap</em> of a packet of gum hitting him in the back of his head, and when he turned around, Triboulet would be so close that she was probably leaning on his body for support.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120067848241430620 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120067848241430620><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 2:09 PM">2:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;NOT A RANDOM KID!&quot;  She jabbed a finger into his side, and as if to support that statement, the overwhelming stench of alchohol that he&#39;d normally associate with Bill wafted into his nose.  &quot;Call me that one more time and I&#39;ll drag your pitiful ass back to whatever godforsaken country you came from!&quot;  Then, hand to her chest and a faux-dignified air that would&#39;ve been convincing if she wasn&#39;t this inebriated, she chose recognition over stealth.  &quot;You speak to <em>the</em> Hero of All Fools, <em>the</em> Triboulet, <em>the</em> court jester of three kings!

Considering what occurred right after, this was the perfect opportunity for her to leave and disappear. Let the oafish Archer deal with whatever Master troubles he had. Unfortunately, sanity was slowly sipping out of the window, thanks to a large serving of drinks and Bill.

&quot;Ya need to ask?!&quot; Bill shoved Roland away. &quot;<em>Really</em> need to ask after these disastrous weeks?! <strong>Ya know nothing!</strong>&quot; He growled, treading over cracked glass and creating a cacophony of sound. Even his footsteps were filled with anger.

As if to retaliate, Roland created his own sound, breaking a bottle to grab Bill&#39;s attention. He then revealed the truth of what was happening, but either out of spite or out of anger, had omitted certain details. What little Bill had been given to work with was enough to power his drunken imagination.

&quot;Dying...? The hell do you mean?!&quot; Bill shouted back, ready to grab Roland by the shoulders and shake him like a tree, only for Triboulet to have enough about being sidelined and make her grand entrance. She tore Roland down for his bigotry (how dare he typecast her?!) and shredded Bill even more for simply being himself. She then praised herself, with all the fanfare that came with it. Titles, history, skills and even the fact that she was a Servant. To think that the once shrewd Assassin had been reduced to such a drunken stupor that she was willingly giving away her title. One could be sure that she would be having the worst hangover ever in just a few hours.

Triboulet had no personal stake in Roland and Lachlan. Hell, she didn&#39;t even know them! But Bill was her prey, and if someone dared take him away from her before she could deliver some just desserts, then there would be-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120135755151450233 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120135755151450233><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 6:39 PM">6:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;Oh, shut up!&quot;</strong> Bill instinctively lunged at Roland, grabbing him by the neck and shoulders before tossing him at Assassin like a trash can lid, clearly designed to cover the can itself (read: her). The boy got off with a scrape at worst, thankfully cushioned by Triboulet&#39;s frame. What was worrying was Bill&#39;s condition. Even Triboulet, who couldn&#39;t stand the man, had noticed that he had never gotten <em>that</em> pissed while drunk.

&quot;What do you mean Lachlan is <em>dying?</em> Is this some sick joke of yours?&quot; Bill growled, ripping off a stick from an arcade machine and tossing it at Roland with pinpoint precision. A small cut appeared on his face as it barely grazed his cheek, instead hitting the wall with a resounding <em>zac</em> as it pierced the marble and remained embedded.

&quot;Hah....&quot; Bill panted, taking deep breaths. He felt exhausted, confused and lost. A Servant came with a high performing body made of Spiritrons and mana, but one that was drunk and volatile as Bill could have surprisingly human struggles to him. In this case, he felt conflicted by what Lachlan had told him. Too many waves trying to lead his boat to all sorts of different places.

His expression was pained, but hateful. Dull, yet spiteful. It was a first-class act, one that even impressed Triboulet. She was drunk, sure, but her love for the arts had never died. Even through that mask of his, she could see the subtlest range of passionate emotions that would make other actors blush.

Whatever Bill was struggling with, it must have been serious if his acting felt so sincere.

&quot;He&#39;s dying, ya say?&quot; Bill asked, regaining his composure. &quot;<strong>Good.</strong> Let him rot. Shouldn&#39;t ya be glad? Ya don&#39;t need to play the cow anymore.&quot; He grumbled, staring at Roland intently.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120135793114095727 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120135793114095727><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 6:39 PM">6:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Yer shackles are coming off. Why save him? What has he done for you or me?&quot; Archer interrogated the kid further, a menacing advance with each step. By the time he reached them, he looked like a giant, overwhelming Triboulet and Roland with his sheer presence. They could sense bloodlust and frustration, like one bad answer was all that was needed for him to start firing. It was his solution to things he couldn&#39;t understand, after all.

The anger in his voice, along with the pain in his steps, made the two of them wonder exactly what sort of weight the outlaw carried. His Master was nothing but a speck to him. Another person in the long list of people he had met. Yet, he felt rather personal about all of this.

&quot;I&#39;m no hero. I&#39;m just a bastard of an outlaw. Ya know this, dontcha?&quot; Roland could tell who that question was referring to. &quot;Why would I ever help? That&#39;s not what I do.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Roland nearly jumped, as he felt a stiff finger jab him in the side. He flinched, then doubled over, clutching his ribs and massaging the spot where Triboulet had struck him. No wonder Triboulet had been summoned into the Assassin class; even when her mind wasn&#39;t entirely there, the jab had been delivered with so much precision that had it been something sharper and more dangerous, things could have ended far worse.

&#39;What&#39;s wrong with you?!&#39; Roland sputtered. &#39;Just run along, and—&#39;

He lifted his head, and found himself face to face with Triboulet&#39;s angry mug. The girl <em>reeked</em> of alcohol; the stench was so strong that it clogged his nostrils and caused them to itch.

Roland squeezed his eyes shut, right as Triboulet was getting to the good part (&#39;the Hero of All Fools!&#39;), and <em>sneezed</em>. He quickly wiped his nose on his sleeves, partially to clean himself, and partially to shield himself from Triboulet&#39;s intense glare. His heart began to palpitate as he finally registered the rest of her speech. The name didn&#39;t ring a bell, but at the mention of &#39;Servant&#39;, he nearly fell over with shock.

Another Servant? In broad daylight? Not in a brawl, but getting chummy with Bill—Lachlan&#39;s Bill?! Roland staggered back...

...and fell right into Bill&#39;s <s>heavenly</s> deadly embrace.

Bill proceeded to wring him like a piece of wet laundry, showing him just how stark the difference was between their strength and the sheer volume of their voices. The Archer had regained some of his former luster, but it quickly transformed into rage, and unfortunately for Roland, he was there to bear the brunt of it.

The dual assault of verbal abuse from both Triboulet and Bill, combined with being tossed around like a ragdoll, had him seeing stars and what little of his life flashing before his eyes. Suddenly, Bill released his grip, and the poor blonde experienced a brief moment of weightlessness before crashing down to the floor.

&#39;Urk...&#39; He landed on something soft. His first instinct was to check his head for injuries. When he found none, he cracked open his eyelids and—

<em>fwip!</em>

Just in time to catch a glimpse of something zooming past his face.

Out of pure reflex, Roland immediately clutched onto the thing closest to him. The softness brought him a sense of comfort in this trying time, but when he focused his gaze on exactly what he had been holding, his mind nearly fried itself.

<strong>&#39;GET AWAY FROM ME!&#39;</strong> He yelled at Triboulet, even as his arms remained wrapped around her like a cushion. Bill&#39;s towering figure cast an ominous shadow over him, and Roland cursed his luck for ending up between two buzzed Servants who were out for blood. What little bravado he had mustered had all but fizzled, and his mind went into overdrive as he grasped at straws on how to get himself out of this pickle...

<em>No...no...! Slow down with the life montage! He still has plenty of unfinished business to attend do, like binge-watching all of his favorite shows!</em>

Roland finally let go of Triboulet. He gathered his legs together and placed his hands in front of him, lowering himself into a perfect <strong>dogeza</strong> before the Archer and Assassin both.

That man when driven to this kind of anger, well beyond anything he had shown her prior, was a disturbing sight indeed.  Her mouth hung open and her words left her, even when her self-control was near nil - she thought she had some kinda comment to make about Roland&#39;s dumb face being...extra dumb or something, but she couldn&#39;t recall the specifics in the face of Bill&#39;s displeasure.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right,&quot; Triboulet added, if only just to say something.

If his Master was to die, well, that wouldn&#39;t mean that he had much more time left on this world.  It&#39;d be a good of a time as any to continue what they were doing, or at least do something besides listen to annoying brats, but Triboulet had other things set aside for her...like being a comfort blanket for this child.

Triboulet&#39;s lip curled upward in disgust, but she kept silent at first as Mr. Bleier wrapped himself around her bony little torso.  The gall on this kid, seriously - she shut her mouth, for she was seriously trying to come up with a good quip for this.  She was about to open her mouth once more when she was blocked from speaking by an outburst, <em>again.</em>

Her whole form recoiled, threatening to take Roland down to the ground, after Roland decided to scream like he was about to be murdered directly in her face.  &quot;Then get away from ME, you twit!&quot; she shouted back, and she flailed for a moment ineffectually - miraculously, even, as she would&#39;ve accidentally snapped his neck without a second thought if she was able to get a palm pressed against his face to push him away.  Roland survived, though, and she offered some other reassurances as he continued to hug her for some goddamned reason.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120440513510785117 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120440513510785117><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 19, 2023 2:50 PM">2:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Seriously, let go!&quot; was one.  &quot;You have no right!&quot; was another.  She was quite fond of &quot;Randy little <em>t&#234;te de noeud,</em> ain&#39;tcha?&quot; though.

He eventually got the message, and released her from his increasingly slick grasp.  Then, of course, he made his plea in as pathetic of a fashion as possible - some of the onlookers deigned to laugh at him, but only briefly, as they had seen what Bill was capable of.  One of the kids had already stolen his ad-hoc projectile from the wall and was gonna sell it on eBay as &#39;Arcade Stick Thrown By World&#39;s Strongest Man&#39;, after all.

Triboulet, though not at all pleased with him or his antics, gave him the benefit of a doubt.  This was probably the main difference between the two Servants and their views of the world and its people.  Bill would almost certainly step in to lord over the little turd, and bask in the power of the moment, before probably stomping a hole through his torso in front of dozens of witnesses.

Triboulet would step in to lord over him, and bask in the power of the moment, but she&#39;d do it a little more gently.

There was a step towards him that&#39;d send Roland&#39;s spine a-quiver, and then a ruffle of soggy clothes as Triboulet squatted down next to him - though not too close, because she didn&#39;t want to get grabbed again.  Seriously, she&#39;s being manhandled a lot today.

&quot;My goooood frieeeeend, I don&#39;t know about Bill...lotta things I don&#39;t know about Bill, but for me?  I ain&#39;t gonna kill you.  Just like I could see a beetle on the pavement as I walk along the street, I have to have the malice in my heart to actually extin...ex...stamp out such an <em>insignificant</em> life.  And I&#39;m a real bitch, but I&#39;m not thaaaat mean, no?&quot;  She laughed to herself, and wiped her nose loudly.  Her enjoyment of this was getting to her head...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120440555181199360 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120440555181199360><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 19, 2023 2:50 PM">2:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;No, no.  I think it&#39;d be better for <strong>both of us</strong> to let&#39;cha live.&quot;  She did cast a brief glance towards Bill here, a silent &#39;just try and fight me on this motherfucker&#39;.  &quot;Bill&#39;s got lots of issues, lots.  And sometimes random killing&#39;s one of them, from my brief inspection of him.  But if he&#39;s &#39;bout to die, you know, &#39;cause his Master&#39;s about to kick the bucket...every second he&#39;s spending killing you, or taunting you, or listening to you cry like a little baby boy...that&#39;s time he isn&#39;t getting back!  Time management!&quot;

Trying to negotiate a deal on two fronts here, both quelling the bandit&#39;s anger and getting this hanger-on to piss off, wasn&#39;t an easy task.  When Roland finally gathered the courage to stop staring at the decades-old grout of the tile in front of his face, however, he&#39;d look up into Triboulet&#39;s angelic face.  Angelic, crooked, spiteful and looking-as-if-she-just-had-a-two-hundred-pound-man-squash-her-flat face.

&quot;So.  Me and Mr. Bill?  We&#39;re going to do exactly what we were doing earlier.  Drinking and getting into fights and not giving <strong>a single fuck</strong> about this Lachl...<em>Locky</em> fellow, the fat-gut prune-faced abortion of a man.  Ain&#39;t even met him, and I am no fan of his!&quot;  She laughed, and patted <em>him</em> on <em>his</em> head and saw how <em>he</em> liked it.  &quot;You are in Egypt!  Simply become a transient here; life on the streets isn&#39;t that bad, let me tell you.  Just learn Arabic real quick.&quot;

Triboulet stepped up from him, giving Bill a window to do whatever he pleased as her back was turned, but she figured that Bill was at least sensible enough to understand what she was getting at.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s fighting that bastard dragon, or a thousand corpses, or God himself.  Whoever Locky&#39;s fighting, I bet they&#39;ll win!  Bill, get o&#39;er here,&quot; she pat at the machine without realizing it was missing a stick now, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take a set from you now.  I feel enlightened!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A bit too strong, perhaps, since it left Roland afraid and Triboulet stunned. The two were unable to add much, resulting in him just staring at the two with his mouth agape before they reacted.

Suddenly Roland took a huge hit in confidence, snuggling up to Triboulet for comfort while being terrified at the same time. Triboulet replied in a drunken rage, freeing herself from the boy&#39;s clinging as the aroma of alcohol filled the room. These three were now no different than a makeshift gang arguing at a saloon, tensions rising as they were on the verge of disbanding.

So, to quell this spat, Triboulet rose up to the center stage, taking the role of ringleader as she attempted to reason with the two men. Even drunk, she had quite the way with words, logically explaining Bill&#39;s situation with the information provided by Roland. In reality, she was being quite selfish, aiming to keep the Archer for herself. Since when had she gotten so smitten with him? Perhaps the thought of clobbering him to death was something she desperately needed, just a little bit of sadism as a treat.

Bill wasn&#39;t sure how to react to that. Should he be flattered, or call Triboulet crazy? He did attract a certain type of women, which usually caused him a lot of trouble. But even while drunk, his mind was far too distracted to focus on one-night stands. While Assassin tapped on the arcade machine and demanded her dog to come running back to her, Bill&#39;s eyes darted to Roland, who was now shrimping himself on the floor into a pathetic looking bow. The boy murmured something about his life being forfeit, the pointlessness of his existence and an odd burial request.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120490597262827571 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120490597262827571><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 19, 2023 6:09 PM">6:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill laughed at the ridiculousness of it all. &quot;Heheheheh. Ya like games, huh? Good, good.&quot; He nodded, then looked back to the arcade machine and casually placed his hand on Assassin&#39;s, an action so abrupt that she was shocked by the boldness of it all. How dare he get so touchy-touchy feely-feely with her?! She was sure he was skipping some extra steps-

<em>slap</em>

-He slapped her hand away, then proceeded to grab the arcade machine and rip off the floor, screws and bolts falling around as he exerted far more strength than he usually would for that feat alone. He then proceeded to toss it at Roland.

<em>THUMP!</em>

The boy&#39;s ears would ring as his body reverberated in shock. The arcade had landed just an inch away from him, sliding across weakly. Part of him felt lucky that Bill was physically inferior to other Servants, but part of him also thought the Archer was holding back.

He certainly didn&#39;t pull his punches with what came afterwards, spuds thumping across the arcade as he reached Roland&#39;s position and stomped right next to his face.

<strong>&quot;Are those enough games for ya?!&quot;</strong> Bill shouted, his voice booming. His eyes burned through Roland&#39;s pitiful appearance: A boy in the prime of his youth was behaving like a subservient mouse and accepting his demise. It didn&#39;t matter if he had the strength or body to fight for his right to live. The will to live wasn&#39;t there, because he had long accepted his role in life. Someone who would forever live in the sidelines. Someone never designed to take the spotlight.

If Lachlan was a mirror, then Roland was the reflection. Two faces of the same coin, and Bill wanted to shoot the crap out of both. It felt so infuriating to see someone else commit his same mistakes. &quot;If ya wanna die, then die already! See if anybody cares.&quot; Bill spat on the floor. &quot;No one is gonna care about some maggot who can&#39;t even fight for his own life. Ya know what&#39;s the difference between Lachlan and you?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120490656918417429 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120490656918417429><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 19, 2023 6:09 PM">6:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
His eyes narrowed, waiting for Roland&#39;s full attention. Once he was sure he got it, he continued.

&quot;Lachlan knows what he <em>wants.</em> What the <em>fuck</em> do <em>you</em> want? Just being Lachlan&#39;s little bitch till the end of time? Fucking marry him already.&quot; Bill leaned down, dragging Roland by the collar and raising him up. &quot;Fight for yerself! How hard can that be? Do you even have a single bone in your body?!&quot; He shook Roland like a pi&#241;ata, almost as if trying to brainwash him into having more self-esteem. He rattled him, slamming him on a wall as he purposefully tried to break the boy. Fight back. Show your fangs. Strike above your weight and pay grade.

&quot;If ya really don&#39;t wanna fight for yerself, then the least ya can do is fight for that ungrateful little brat.&quot; Bill snarled, most likely referring to Lachlan. &quot;Well? How bad do ya want it then? <strong>Show me what ya got.&quot;</strong> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was dead. Dead as a doormat.

Roland tried to make peace with his fate. But when he felt a hand on the back of his head, the fear of death still flickered through his mind, causing him to shiver and flinch. A lilting, foreign-sounding voice; Triboulet spoke in his ears, her voice melodic yet venomous, delivering words that struck at his self-worth like a skillful blade.

Roland listened, his head reeling with with each measured word. He had always considered Lachlan&#39;s verbal jabs to be the pinnacle of insults, but compared to Triboulet, they appeared as mere childish pranks. When the girl left him like a slug on the ground, he didn&#39;t even feel a sense of relief, because that was only the prelude to the storm...

And it was about to crash upon him with full force.

Roland retreated into himself, trying to make himself as small a target as possible. That didn&#39;t stop Bill, however, as he uprooted an arcade machine and hurled it towards Roland with the precision of an Archer, narrowly missing his head. He then pulled Roland up without so much as breaking a sweat, pinning him against the wall and squeezing the life out of him.

Roland flailed, face turning red from the lack of oxygen, all the while enduring Bill&#39;s relentless insults that stripped him down to his very bones. How inelegant and subservient Roland was, forever chasing after scraps, the dog who willingly subjected himself to the tyrannical rule of his master. Bill had expressed his disapproval of Roland&#39;s incompetence on multiple occasions in the past, but this time, he had reached his breaking point.

<em>Yep,</em> Roland thought. <em>I&#39;m as good as dead. Should&#39;ve written a will while I still had the chance...</em>

Bill continued to berate him, attacking his nonexistent pride, trying to provoke him, to goad him into fighting back, but all the while, the only thing Roland could think of...was...

&#39;Ah...so you&#39;re saying you won&#39;t kill me? Neither of you? Can I take that as a promise...?&#39; He muttered, his voice barely audible against the ruckus of the arcade. &#39;Well, that certainly makes things easier...&#39;

Roland got up from the ground without another word, pulling himself into some semblance of a standing position, if you&#39;ll excuse his wobbly knees. He straightened his clothes and smoothed his hair, which had been thoroughly ruffled by Triboulet, then further disturbed by Bill&#39;s violent thrashing. Then he cleared his throat. Oh, good, he could still make a sound.

He turned and took a glass from a dumbfounded bystander, quickly downing its contents without caring what it was. Patted some dollar bills into the guy&#39;s hand before he could complain, then found his next target and dittoed the action, draining the liquid from their glass. 

He went around the arcade, consuming whatever he could get his hands on with reckless abandon. Liqueur, beer, spirits, and various cocktails swirled in his stomach, irritating his digestive tracks and burning his throat. He didn&#39;t care. Emboldened himself, psyched himself up with alcohol; if this didn&#39;t work, then he would be dead either way.

A last-ditch attempt to clutch his final straw.

But you fail to see that. Why? Is it because my approach doesn&#39;t align with your idea of &quot;strength&quot;, so I&#39;m deemed unworthy? Unlike <em><strong>YOU</strong></em>&#39;—he jabbed a finger first at Bill, then at Triboulet—&#39;who are <em><strong>SO POWERFUL</strong></em>&#39;—he gestured towards the broken arcade machine—&#39;that you can just chuck furniture around without a care when you&#39;re angry, I can only chuck beer bottles and <em>still</em> have to think twice about the consequences. You think <em>I&#39;m</em> spineless?&#39; He slapped his own chest. &#39;Why don&#39;t you try looking at things from my perspective and see how difficult it is for me?&#39;

<strong>&#39;BUT YOU CAN&#39;T! BECAUSE THE WORLD ONLY REVOLVES AROUND YOU AND YOUR INSUFFERABLE EGO!&#39;</strong>

Roland delivered a hard kick at the broken machine, causing a cascade of tokens to tumble out at his feet. He grabbed a handful of them and flung them at Bill.

&#39;So this is it, huh?&#39; He seized another handful of tokens, stormed up to Triboulet, and showered her head with the metallic, jingling rain. And as if that weren&#39;t enough, he even parted with her his bottle, although it had already been emptied out. 

&#39;So this is it,&#39; he said, gesturing around himself with a sweep of his arms. The raucous music blasting through the hall, the vibrant pixels and flashing neon lights emanating from the arcade and karaoke machines...he had been part of this scene not long ago...how easy it was to let himself be drawn in, to let go...

&#39;You&#39;re here to indulge yourselves. Live a life of extravagance, drown yourselves in booze, tokens, and music. Is that what you came here for? To seek pleasure? <strong>YOU CALL THIS ENJOYMENT?!</strong>&#39;

He spat.

He&#39;s stubborn, got a terrible temper, a royal pain in the ass to work with, but when he makes a wrong turn, he fucking owns up to it. Bites the bullet and walks the path even if it leads to hell. What about you?&#39;

Roland glared at Bill with bloodshot eyes. &#39;Look at yourself. You, who ran away at the slightest hint of trouble, just because things didn&#39;t pan out the way you wanted... And <strong>you!</strong>&#39;

He turned sharply towards Triboulet. Worked his jaw, shook his head in disbelief. &#39;Go screw yourself,&#39; he laughed bitterly. &#39;You think I can&#39;t tell what you&#39;re trying to pull here? Bill is squandering his precious hours away, but you&#39;ve got no shortage of time. All it takes is a few words to seduce him, and voila!&#39; He clapped violently over her head. &#39;You&#39;ve just eliminated a Servant for your own Master without so much as lifting a finger. What a magnificent &quot;assassination&quot;! What a profitable deal! You&#39;ve got nothing to lose in this, and shame on <strong>YOU</strong> for falling for it!&#39; He redirected his ire towards Bill.

&#39;You don&#39;t even pause to think why you&#39;re still here, in the flesh! If Lachy really got fed up with you, then why are you still able to drink your fill, and party to your heart&#39;s content? Are you really that dense?&#39;

He moved closer, until he was barely arm&#39;s length from Bill.

&#39;<strong>SO YOU DIDN&#39;T GET THE MASTER YOU WANTED, BIG-FUCKING-DEAL.</strong> Just put a bullet in your own mouth, go back to the Throne, and have another go at the Master lottery. But people like Lachy and me will <em>never</em> have the chance to do that. This is all we&#39;ve got, and you&#39;ve just wasted this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him, <em>and I mean it</em>, because if he dies here, there won&#39;t be a next time. People like us, <strong>we don&#39;t get unlimited shots at the spinning wheel!</strong>&#39;

He stumbled backwards, chest heaving, until he collided with the broken machine. 

&#39;If you didn&#39;t want to be summoned, then step aside and let someone else answer the call. If you&#39;re going to linger around this cesspit and complain about the stench, <strong>then at least fucking <em>piss</em> in it!</strong>&#39;

He clutched Bill&#39;s mask so tightly that it seemed he might dent it. Or worse, break his own fingers. He pressed it into his frame, eyes stinging with angry tears.

&#39;Yeah, you&#39;re right. I have no pride. I&#39;ll do whatever it takes I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll bow my head if I have to! So go ahead, kick my face in. Call me a cow, a beetle, see if I care!&#39; His voice cracked. &#39;To you, I may only seem like an insignificant crawl thing, but Lachy...&#39; He hesitated. Then, slowly, he looked up, uncertainly swirling in his eyes.

He made up his mind.

<strong>&#39;Despite everything, he&#39;s still my friend.&#39;</strong> His hands trembled. &#39;I just want things to go back to the way they were. And if that&#39;s not gonna work, then I want you to avenge him at the very least. You&#39;re an Archer, you&#39;ve got <em>plenty</em> of time to do that and more! Find a new Master if you want, not like I can stop you. Is that really too much to ask from a mighty Servant like you?!&#39; He threw the mask at Bill&#39;s feet.

What he got instead was a war, watching Roland sow chaos across the arcade as he joined them in their binge drinking. However, instead of festering away in a night of passion, he started calling out the two, loudmouthed Servants. How could he not, when their egos were off the charts? They had suffered a lot. Been hurt a lot. Been hurt so bad that the comforts of alcohol, arcades and much more didn&#39;t seem terrible. That was how someone like Bill coped after all, for the life of an outlaw was an unfulfilling one.

The difference was that people like Bill and Triboulet had lived it. They already had their chance, and were fortunate enough to receive another. People like Lachlan and Roland didn&#39;t have such a luxury, doomed to be forgotten by the sands of time with their bodies being used as sustenance for the summon of a distant ghoul a century later, perhaps.

While Triboulet got lambasted for playing up her femme fatale angle, Bill was the one who took the brunt of Roland&#39;s tirade. The thoughts he had kept bottled up since the Servant&#39;s summon were resurfacing, hitting Archer in a cataclysmic wave of anger, fear, and pure drunken idiocy. The booze had helped Roland become so ballsy that the brat started grabbing at Bill&#39;s mask, threatening to pull it off!

<em>rrriiiip</em>

&quot;Get yo hands off me!&quot; Bill growled, talking like he was dealing with a child having a tantrum. He shoved Roland aside, but the boy was persistent, ripping at the Servant&#39;s fine cloth while they delivered exactly what Bill had asked for: Their motivation for helping Lachlan.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120815950111969362 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120815950111969362><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 3:42 PM">3:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Friendship. An incredibly hard thing for Bill to believe, especially considering how Lachlan had treated both of them, yet there was no mistaking the passion in Roland&#39;s eyes. Until he could say with a clear conscience that his debt to the Dowlings had been paid, Roland was willing to protect Lachlan with his <strong>life.</strong> Even if it meant challenging a Servant. Even if that Servant was someone he knew quite a lot of, like Bill.

Roland was purposefully walking into a gunfight, yet he didn&#39;t even have a knife at hand. It was idiotic, suicidal and futile. Yet how could Archer ever hope to compete with that? Greed and foolishness that rivalled his own, to the point he unwittingly let Roland tug even harder, causing the mask to fall off.

<em>rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiip</em>

There it was, Bill&#39;s face. His hair was as messy and unkempt as ever, being a tangled mess of black seaweeds. His face looked broken and bruised, no doubt from various fights and a bottle here and there. Even Triboulet could see him: Quite the looker, in the sense that she had expected him to look like a piss covered rat from a shady alley. But what struck out the most to the two were the slight tears in his eyes. He hadn&#39;t even realized that he was crying, too used to reacting with rage anytime things didn&#39;t go his way. Why was he crying?

Was looking at the past <em>that</em> painful? Back when he still cared about someone worthy of his protection?

<em>slap!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120815983100166325 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120815983100166325><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 3:42 PM">3:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Without saying a word, he slapped Roland on the cheek and grabbed back his mask. He immediately put it on, covering his face with his hat for a second before eventually reemerging. He had hidden himself once more, but Roland&#39;s words had hit their target. The alcohol&#39;s high was fading and all that was left were regrets from the past, present and future. He thought to himself: Would he have been as brave as Roland in this situation? As brave as Shaft? As brave as <em>his dad?</em> All of them knew to fight for what they believed in, regardless of the repercussions. Bill didn&#39;t fight for <em>anything.</em> Just himself.

What did <em>he</em> believe in, then? What was he fighting for?

&quot;You fucking win, <em>brat.&quot;</em> Bill scoffed, sounding both furious and insulted. The fact that Roland had made him cry was the perfect opportunity to tarnish his legend. &quot;Ya got one thing right: If yer Master is still pumping me full of mana, that means we&#39;re still partners. How unprofessional of me to forget that.&quot; He adjusted his mask, making sure it was tight and fit as he turned back to Assassin who had patiently watched the entire thing unfold.

&quot;If Shaft were here, I know what he&#39;d say.&quot; What Bill said almost sounded like a joke, but the way he said it clearly showed that he was serious, that Shaft was his moral compass. &quot;Can&#39;t say no to a crying brat. C&#39;mon then!&quot; He waved for Roland, pointing towards the exit. He then cast a glance back at Assassin.

&quot;Tribble. Ya coming?&quot; He asked, with that vile pet name that could make Assassin&#39;s toes curl from disgust. &quot;The sooner we get this done the quicker we can get back to-&quot; He shook his hand into a circle, clearly referring to the entire arcade. &quot;Yeah? Pretty please.&quot; Bastard went from crying to playing cute now? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Egyptian fighting game world would never be the same, and now it lay in wait for the Pakistanis to take control of the Middle Eastern tournament scene.  Barry, to you, Triboulet&#39;s heart goes out.  You were her one true friend to be found today.  Pagliacci, to you, Triboulet gives a nod of respect.  You were the one who inspired this fool to be something better...to let the world become a fan of a real fool, once again.  And to the developers of this edition of World Fightblast: <em>congratulations.</em>

Triboulet whined as the plan she had fell apart to violence, and also because her hand just got whapped by a Servant - that shit stung.  &quot;Could&#39;ve just said no, you shit-stain.&quot;

With the violence turning from &#39;entertaining mess&#39; to &#39;holy shit he&#39;s actually gonna kill someone&#39;, the crowd decided that <em>now</em> was a fine time to stop gawking and start respecting their personal space.  By the time the words &#39;ungrateful little brat&#39; had escaped Bill&#39;s mouth, just about everyone had retreated to the far edges of the arcade or left outright.  Those who remained were mostly drunk, and their glasses were to be stolen by Roland in short order, alas.  The owner of the establishment...apparently had given up on life in his own way, as he simply watched the destruction of thousands of dollars of property with a glum look and a quickly-opened cap of beer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120866181352542229 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120866181352542229><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 7:02 PM">7:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet mostly stood to the side and let these two fight it out while she downed whatever Roland didn&#39;t yoink.  What&#39;s the point in trying to care?  I mean, for fuck&#39;s sake, <em>she</em> thought she had a dysfunctional relationship with her Master, she couldn&#39;t even begin to fix whatever nonsense was going on here.  Or, given her state, process it.  Roland had to stir the beehive a bit by throwing his finger towards her though, and she looked up from her drink to give him her own thumb pressed between pointer and middle fingers the first time.

The second time, doused in at least <em>dozens</em> of pounds of the local currency and called a pointless hedonist, Triboulet raised her arm in defense but didn&#39;t seem to give too much of a hoot.  The child, he already ruined her day, she wasn&#39;t going to give him an inch.

The <em>third</em> time though, she did.  Roland worked up gumption, Roland made her a much more direct target, and Roland accused her of something <em>heinous.</em>  She dropped her drink, probably because she was getting too drunk to hold things the right way, and parroted back <em><strong>&quot;Seduce</strong></em> him?  Seduce him?!&quot;  She almost choked on what was left in her throat.  &quot;Ya stupid low-born son of a sheepherder and a sheep, you&#39;re talking about <em>him,</em> I&#39;m not here for anything like him!  I was here to try and get some fuckin&#39;, I dunno,&quot; she ran a hand through her rank hair, &quot;I wanted to talk about culture and the like!  To educate!  And I know I have supremely failed at that shit, but don&#39;t you dare accuse me of wanting to take Bill&#39;s Cherrykey into me!&quot;

No offense, Bill.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120866255046447194 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120866255046447194><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 7:02 PM">7:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Aside from that though, offense was what Triboulet had in spades, almost enough to let the gravity of all of this pass her by.  If she was in a better state, seeing this man of the modern day tear himself and his life apart in soliloquoy would&#39;ve been nothing short of <em>sublime.</em>  Like a play, but in real life!  And more vulgar!  This kind of drama was what she lived for, and it was only towards the tail-end, when the kid asked to be called a cow <s>which she did</s> that she thought about it all and understood in part.

Congratulations for getting into Triboulet&#39;s thick skull, Roland - you had gained a little of her own respect.  She&#39;s handing this out quite liberally today.

All of this was secondary to the surprise that Bill was actually kinda attractive.

The fool looked up at him and his revealed image, and she looked up at him for probably a bit longer than she expected.  There was something past the grime of his rough life that she would be able to put into poetry later, a certain darkness, and an everpresent sadness in himself that had only just broken through the facade in a literal and metaphorical sense...and boy, that kinda made her feel like her earlier comment...

God&#39;s wounds, Triboulet, you&#39;ve had way too much!  Starting to think unwise thoughts.  Triboulet, finally, put her glass down and called it good for the day.

All that aside, she was there enough to realize the gravity of Bill&#39;s tears.  Once again, if only she was sober, for she&#39;d be in a position to tear him apart and let even more tears flow...or, honestly, just try and help him.  That he had a side capable of this was a surprise too, even if he clearly hated its existence like nothing else.  A shame she wasn&#39;t the one to find this aspect for herself.

At the end, Triboulet was fine with putting this on hiatus.  Not that they had much choice anyway, the police were probably going to arrive within the next ten minutes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120866299438956645 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120866299438956645><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 7:02 PM">7:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Fiiiiiine,&quot; she said with a smile to contrast Bill&#39;s tears, &quot;I&#39;ll help you...not that I&#39;m any help to begin with, drunk or no, aha.&quot;  She took one step forward, and another, and once she was confident in her stability she rolled her shoulders.  A couple coins from earlier fell onto the floor.  &quot;I suppose if you&#39;ve <em>entertained</em> me this much, I can help you out this once.  My Master will be pissed when he hears about it, but what&#39;s he going to do?  Send me out alone again?&quot;

Triboulet stood beside the two, and she gave a brief sigh of contentment.  And a hiccup.  &quot;Who&#39;s he fighting, anyway?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Roland stumbled backwards until he tripped over the broken arcade machine in a tangle of limbs, and landed hard on his back. His cheek stung from Bill&#39;s slap—but then again, his entire head was already spinning. 

He stared up at the ceiling, until the tiles finally stopped multiplying and gradually snapped back into focus. He had committed a crime that could have put his head on the chopping block several times over, yet it felt <em>good</em>. The excitement of having just done something forbidden...it was well worth the risk.

He flailed on the ground for a while, until eventually he latched onto the arcade machine and propped himself up against it. At Bill&#39;s response, he wiped his eyes dry and pulled his half swollen face into a lopsided smile.

&#39;A brat, <em>me?</em>&#39; He exhaled through his nose. &#39;I&#39;m twenty-two now, dickhead. Can&#39;t just go easy on you all the time.&#39;

He flexed effortlessly, thoughtlessly, tapping into the nuggets of knowledge he had acquired during his childhood days of playing pretend cowboy on his toy horse. Intoxication had him throwing caution to the wind. If he had survived thus far, then whatever he did next would likely be safe.

Which was why he extended his hand towards the midget Servant moving to his side.

&#39;If you&#39;re going to help, start by helping me up.&#39; He said testily. No, he wasn&#39;t ready to forgive and forget. Only the guilty would protest so vehemently when accused, of that he was sure.

And to add to the wager, he raised his eyebrows at Triboulet, as far as they could reach. &#39;If you can&#39;t even handle <em>my</em> weight, what makes you think you can be of any help? We&#39;re talking about a literal bear of a man here.&#39;

James&#39; image surfaced in his mind—tall, dark, imposing like a grizzly bear. It blended with the image of the Dancer and all the other things he personally found horrifying. Roland closed his eyes, and tried to isolate the man&#39;s face.

Her situation could be better, though.

The description she was given, at first, could&#39;ve been anyone.  Tall and dark, and it seemed as if trenchcoats were quite popular this year, going by how many people wore them.  As she pulled Roland up from the ground, small fingers wrapped around his but lifting him effortlessly despite his claims otherwise, Triboulet thought.  And this thought was written right on her face, for her eyes grew wide in fear...

...and then Triboulet laughed.

Her laugh was quite something.  Shrill and loud, far more powerful than her frame would suggest, and she was the kind of person who snorted quite often.  This kind of laughter, it was to be found in people who not only had a powerful sense of humor, but those who simply couldn&#39;t help but use their cackles as a weapon of mockery in and of itself.  If this was a situation where Triboulet was making light of either of them it&#39;d feel quite rude...but it didn&#39;t seem like she was laughing at them at all.

What did she find funny?  The description?  That their enemy is a &#39;terrible shot&#39;?  Whatever it was, she must&#39;ve found it absolutely fucking hilarious, as she continued to laugh well past the point of comfort.

She doubled over, gripping at her stomach like some part of her was giving out, and if someone was concerned enough to outstretch a hand she&#39;d wave her own to dismiss it.  The clown ambled around the room on her unstable legs, still laughing just as loud as before, her messy hair covering her face in a blonde curtain.  She reached for the bar for stability, as her laughter threatened to throw her back onto the ground.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121127622529790055 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121127622529790055><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 12:20 PM">12:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then, mid-guffaw, she took a beer bottle and slung it at Bill&#39;s face without a second&#39;s warning.

It cracked against his face and shattered, sending its remnants of ale all over the place along with its dark green glass - Bill putting his mask back on saved him from anything worse than a bump on the nose, but it probably wouldn&#39;t save him from the follow-up.  Triboulet was upon him instantly, leaping onto his front and latching on like a cat so she could start to beat him about the face violently.

Whatever was giving her trouble must&#39;ve been brought on by a sense of betrayal, as that was what she wore as she assaulted him, along with a loud shout of <strong>&quot;YOU BASTARD!&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Good. Take care of this brat for me.&quot; Bill snapped his fingers, immediately ordering around his new ally. Triboulet wouldn&#39;t be too pleased, especially once Roland started throwing shade at her worth in a fight. The three musketeers were quite the dysfunctional band of fools, but they were Lachlan&#39;s only hope at survival. After all, who else could save him from the enigmatic assassin in a trench coat, one that apparently called others kids and was a terrible shot?

&quot;-Hey. Are ya making fun of me or something?&quot; Archer once again showed how self-centered he was, taking Roland&#39;s description as a thinly veiled jab towards him. Triboulet didn&#39;t help either, suddenly breaking down into laughter as if she had just heard the funniest joke of all time. Bill grew both embarrassed and irritated.

&quot;Shut up! It wasn&#39;t that funny!&quot; Bill snarled. &quot;I&#39;ll kick ya out of the gang if ya keep it u-&quot;

<em>SMASH!</em>

He was so shocked at Roland&#39;s &#39;joke&#39; that he hadn&#39;t realized the bottle aimed straight for his head. It cracked into fine shards, some of them embedding into his mask as Bill now felt literally punch-drunk.

<em>&quot;...The fuck ya doin&#39;...bitch..&quot;</em> Bill whispered, only for Assassin to continue her assault. She dropped him down on the floor and immediately mounted him, legs wrapped around his with the agility of a cat as she seemed intent on finishing off her prey. She went to town on him, targeting his face as she screamed curses at him that felt far beyond that of a joke.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121165370770870312 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121165370770870312><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 2:50 PM">2:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
This had all played out a billion times to Bill. Even back then, before he became an outlaw, it was common for him to get into fights at saloons, regardless of whether he wanted to or not. Grappling your target to the floor was always a good one. Blocked their escape route, pressed your weight against theirs. Let gravity do the work for your punches and let the floor hit the back of their head.

Now, the weakness of this strategy was that you needed to be quite the heavy bastard to make this work. A mouse like Tribble could never hope to keep him pinned down for long, so no wonder she was being so desperate. The second flaw was that most people just aimed for the head, because it was satisfying as fuck to see one&#39;s skull slam down the floor while blood spurted out of the back.

So, if he just tilted his head, then-

<em>SLAM!</em>

Assassin would be shocked, watching one of her knuckles collide with the floor instead of Bill&#39;s soft cheeks. Archer had allowed himself to be beaten enough times to figure out a tempo to Triboulet&#39;s punches. Once he predicted the next punch, he just turned his head to the side to dodge it. It bought him a second of time.

A second was all that he needed.

<strong>&quot;YOU BITCH!&quot;</strong> He roared back, a directly reply to Assassin&#39;s previous string of curses. Bill raised his head and headbutted Triboulet on her large forehead, then exerted as much strength as possible into his legs. He raised himself up, throwing Triboulet off balance while simultaneously gripping at her arms and wrists. He then pushed hard, shoving himself forward until the situation had been flipped: Now Triboulet was the one lying down the floor while Bill was pressed on top of her, like a spider about to devour its next meal.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121165392929366036 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121165392929366036><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 2:50 PM">2:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Even worse, the rat had snuck something into his pocket during the previous scuffle. A large shard of glass from the broken bottle appeared in his palm, pressed directly at Triboulet&#39;s neck. Bill was sure it wouldn&#39;t do anything to the wannabe Assassin, but it was better than no threat at all.

&quot;Are ya <em>that</em> fuckin&#39; drunk?&quot; Bill immediately asked, narrowing his eyes as he hoped that Triboulet was just playing another unfunny prank on him. Unfortunately, he knew this feeling all too well: The looming dread of betrayal, the stench of a rat about to snitch on your gang. Even if she was an actress, it was shocking to see Triboulet perfectly play the role of a traitor.

The cogs in Bill&#39;s head started turning. He looked to Roland, almost as if asking for advice. &quot;Brat, does that person have a name? Are they a Master? If so, where&#39;s their Servant-&quot; He glanced back to Triboulet. The theories in his head shocked him.

Bill was so confused by the sudden turn of events that in the grapple, he had neglected to cover one of his weaknesses. Triboulet could see it easily, seeing little Johnny at the end of Bill&#39;s groin and buckle. One knee was all it would take. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just look at—&#39;

His gesture to indicate the midget Assassin next to him was interrupted by an empty space where she had originally occupied. Instead of her figure, it was her shrill laugh that reached him next. Roland blinked at the empty space, dumbfounded.

Eventually he located Triboulet again, who had somehow paraded herself around the room, laughing all the while. It almost felt like a performance, only that it had left its audience utterly bewildered.

What was he supposed to do...clap? Roland looked at Bill, slowly raising his shoulders as if to say, <em>&#39;<strong>This</strong> if your type?&#39;</em> Not that he was going to judge, of course, but they <em>were</em> kind of in a rush, and time was a-ticking away...

&#39;Alright,&#39; he stumbled over to Bill. &#39;You know what, we don&#39;t have time for this. Can you just grab her and...&#39;

<em><strong>SMASH!!!</strong></em>

A bottle of beer exploded in Bill&#39;s face, showering a nearby Roland in a fizzy cascade of liquid and glass. Roland spluttered and flailed around blindly, until he finally got his hands on what he thought was a piece of cloth...only to realize soon after that he was smearing his face on another customer. 

Fortunately, the customer&#39;s attention was fixated elsewhere. Roland followed their gaze, and with a horrible sinking feeling in his stomach, saw the two Servants locked in a full-blown brawl.

What the hell was happening?!

<em><strong>&#39;Do either of you MIND?!&#39;</strong></em> So mortified was he by Archer and Assassin&#39;s embarrassing display, that for a moment, Roland forgot they were powerful Servants capable of snapping his neck with a pinky. And so he raised his voice at the both of them. &#39;Can you <em>please</em> get a move on—&#39;

He circled around the Servants next like a referee in a wrestling match, positioning himself to keep an eye on Bill. &#39;How the hell should I know where his Servant is?!&#39; He flapped his arms. &#39;It&#39;s not like Lachy knew where <em>you</em> were until I found you right here!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121199587479261316 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121199587479261316><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 5:06 PM">5:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She shouted incoherently, and pulled back her own body - for that perfect second Triboulet was open, and then she was held at shardpoint.  Now, she couldn&#39;t keep perfectly still, as she swayed and held a hand to her pained forehead, but she did give Bill what he wanted.

There was a sharp inhale after Bill cut himself off.  &quot;You people pointed at me, n&#39; called ME Judas Iscariot for trying to be kind...&quot; she looked down at him with a great deal of venom in her eye, &quot;to think you were all just dragging me away...to think I was that&quot;

&quot;FUCKING&quot;

<strong>&quot;STUPID!&quot;</strong>

She punctuated her self-spite with a burst of violence, and she did what she could to end the Bill family tree at the stump.  Uncoordinated from the drink and held at disadvantage from the drink though, there was a halting half-attempt as she was slightly off the mark, which she followed immediately after with a deadly-accurate knee.  This moment afforded Bill a strike, or a moment to pull away, or any number of things.

Immediately after, bloodied or not, Triboulet jumped up from the floor and to the bar.  With a high-pitched grunt she knelt down to one of the stools rooted in place, and then pulled it up from the very earth itself!  Now given a metallic, plush-topped morningstar, Triboulet went swinging, aiming for Bill&#39;s midsection <s>as anything higher was probably too high for her</s></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That mistake cost him dearly, with Triboulet taking advantage of the distraction to deliver a powerful knee to his groin.

Bill whimpered. It was loud and painful, to the point that Roland felt solidarity. His stones had been cracked, while Assassin had freed herself and jumped inside the bar, mumbling something about Judas and how she was an idiot and such.

Bill felt inclined to agree. Hell, he had far more choice words for her after that strike to his nuts. Unfortunately, she would never hear them, since Triboulet had already gone back to the offensive and threatened to slam a stool down the cowboy&#39;s chest.

Archer instinctively reached for his gun, but realized quickly that he&#39;d be unable to fire in time with how close and fast Assassin was. He raised his fists and formed a crude guard, tanking the stool head on before wrapping his hands around it and lifting it up, with Triboulet alongside it. He felt eternally grateful that his opponent was such a little midget.

&quot;This is for my nuts.&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, his viciousness at full display as he tossed the stool aside, disarming Triboulet and threatening a punch. Of course, Assassin would see it coming...except Bill was doing that to hide a lengthy kick. Triboulet was so focused on Bill&#39;s height that she had neglected the treacherous attacks that came from down below.

<em>THWACK!</em>

In an almost cartoonish fashion, Bill&#39;s boot collided with Triboulet&#39;s own groin, filling her with unspeakable amounts of pain as she bounced off the ground like a soccer ball. She was stunned, giving Bill ample time to ready himself as he finally took out his gun. Instead of taking aim at his opponent, however, he turned back to Roland.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121574045171847230 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121574045171847230><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 22, 2023 5:54 PM">5:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Where the hell is Lachlan then?! Back at the hotel?&quot; Bill growled, shaking his head as he glared at Triboulet with contempt. &quot;It&#39;s so fucking stupid now that I think about it...&quot;

&quot;A Master going after Lachlan and not immediately icing him with their own Servant? A Servant just dilly-dallying with no Master around? Sure, there can always be more than one idiot &#39;round town, but you-&quot; Bill glared at Assassin, raising his gun and keeping it pointed at her.

&quot;-you reek. My gut tells me ya need a bullet in yer skull, right now.&quot; Archer grumbled, sounding angered. <strong>&quot;It was yer Master that attacked mine,</strong> wasn&#39;t it?

Or, more precisely, he tripped on the sopping wet floor as the stool flew past him, and only narrowly avoided a collision with the ground by knocking over a few innocent bystanders in the process. As Archer and Assassin continued to sow chaos in the arcade, people either kept their distance, watching the fight from the safety of the bar area, or hastily fled the scene, enjoying their &#39;free&#39; drinks along the way. One could only wonder if the building owner had insurance to cover the damages caused by the brawl.

Seeking refuge, Roland hurriedly climbed over the bar, finding solace in the safety of the thick slabs of granite and wood. He peered cautiously over the top, and when Bill barked questions at him, he threw up his hands in exasperation and responded defiantly.

<strong>&#39;The hotel, of course! Where else? Do I need to draw you a map?!&#39;</strong>

He quickly ducked back down as Bill unsheathed his guns. Eavesdropped on the slurred and heated exchange taking place on the other side. It wasn&#39;t just Triboulet who had lost her composure; Bill, too, was seething with rage. Though one might argue that his reaction was justified, there seemed to be more at stake here than a mere grudge over an injured little man.

Roland barely manage to grasp the bits and pieces of information from the disjointed conversation. All the while, his fingers grew cold with dread. If what Bill had been saying was true, then...

Had he fucked up? Was coming here a mistake after all?

&#39;I gotta-I gotta go back,&#39; Roland slapped his own cheeks to pump himself up. What if his impulsive decision to come here had sealed Lachlan&#39;s fate?

<strong>&#39;I&#39;m going back!&#39;</strong> He shouted over the bar counter. Shakily, he swung one leg over the top, followed by the next, and threw himself towards the exit!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121867753305931798 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121867753305931798><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 23, 2023 1:21 PM">1:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Indeed, by the end of the day, so much damage had been accrued that he wouldn&#39;t be able to keep his doors open.  The Magic had gone from this World, at the hands of two loud-mouthed, violent, idiotic and hard-drinking tourists.  The best he could do to deal with the pain was drink it away.

Pain was something about to haunt Triboulet too; when his fist came out right after the stool, her hand moved to catch it (already foolish enough with her light strength) and another went out to counter...and she was indeed blinded.  First by the deception, Bill&#39;s acumen in fist-to-fist combat being illustrated in the maneuver, and second by the pain that shot up from bottom to top.  Her lightweight body went backwards like a marionette jerked backwards on the string, bouncing, skidding and then flying into the establishment&#39;s sole claw machine, which shattered instantly.

There were many obscenities in her head to shout back at Bill, but none came to mind, for she was that thoroughly disarmed by the shock.  When she opened her eyes next she was looking into the face of a stuffed yellow bear, which seemed plenty happy with how her life was going.

For a moment she couldn&#39;t bring out any words beyond pained moaning, but shortly afterward, something slightly more intelligible came: &quot;...Joy to the world...forever deprived of...terrible spawn of my creation...&quot;

She had to act the fool.  The next strike was liable to kill her if she didn&#39;t put in even a token effort at comedy, so she gave that invisible judge of humor <em>something</em> to bite on.

One hint.  What Bill did next might as well be irrelevant.  A gun to her head, she looked up from the mire of plushies and spat in his direction.

&quot;That little runt, from he said...it sure sounds like my Master.  I can imagine...t&#39;was <em>your</em> Master that started it.&quot;  She forced a laugh.  &quot;You hate him so much and <em>now</em> you act surprised when he picks fights?  Acts as a bull?  You even stand to defend him.  I guess you are a Servant, through and through.&quot;  One hand to prop herself up on the broken rim of the machine, unknowningly cutting into her hand.  Pink fur was stained red as it seeped to the bottom.  &quot;Shoot me in defense of your Master, <em>like the dog you are.&quot;</em>

This was a bit of a subtle joke, as she threw a stuffed dog at his face in the same moment, but it wasn&#39;t as if Bill was going to be such an expert at toy animal identification that he&#39;d suddenly notice this by looking at it from a milimeter away.

Triboulet slid out like a bolt of lightning, at first almost slipping as the residual pain in her crotch was still powerful, but keeping her ground.  Her eyes trained on the gun and prayed that the shots would go wild, just wild enough that she&#39;d be spared the bullet, and with the one knife in her possession she took advantage of this split-second distraction to...

...cut him across the leg, once.  Not even a deep cut.

She sprinted out of the Arcade at full speed, passing by Roland in an instant - her feet fell out from underneath her once, twice, and she simply rolled to pick back up, her physique and her adrenaline doing all that it could to beat the alcohol.  Killing Bill wouldn&#39;t give her anything and she felt as if there was no chance of it happening in the first place, so she simply did what she could to slow him down, avoid the problem.  Avoid the man.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121899947692937226 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121899947692937226><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 23, 2023 3:29 PM">3:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Avoid the responsibility of killing him.

It was a damn shame that it had to come to this.

She put those thoughts in the corner - the <strong>hotel</strong>.  That was where she needed to be, what she needed to find, and all she had to go off of.  Roland&#39;s direction as he left was a slight signifier, but this was Berenice, there could be any number of hotels on the direction of the street that kid had run down.  It would have to suffice.

Streaking away, hoping to put as much space between her and her inevitable pursuer, she ran through the streets of Berenice with little intent to hide.  Presence Concealment did the lightest work to hide her from the eyes of the masses, but the overturned carts, bounding awnings, they were left unexplained.  All the same...Bill was going to make a hell of a lot more mess when he caught up.

A target for him to defeat. His gun was ready to fire at her kneecaps to prevent an escape, just in time too since the jester had finally given up on hiding her identity. His guess turned out to be spot on as Assassin confessed to her allegiances, immediately calling out Bill for being a chained dog. After all, even though he said he was &#39;done&#39; with Lachlan, he was still acting worried about him.

Archer narrowed his eyes, having some choice words to say, followed by two doses of lead. Before he could interject, however, Roland immediately broke down from the panic, realizing what Bill was saying. He started screaming about heading back, which was exactly what Bill <em>didn&#39;t</em> want. It would lead Assassin back to the hotel!

&quot;Stop ya dumbass! She&#39;s-&quot; Bill screamed, but Triboulet interrupted him with a plush to the face. He grunted, shoving it away, before feeling a cold cut to his leg. Blood spurted out quite quickly.

&quot;Ngh!&quot; He grunted, feeling part of his leg gradually go numb as Assassin sped past him and disappeared. Without a doubt, she intended to slow him down, knowing that she couldn&#39;t kill him. Her true objective was Lachlan, since he was the weaker target and currently under attack by her own Master as well.

That&#39;s what Bill assumed had least. He had no idea of the true intentions behind Assassin&#39;s retreat. All he knew was that he absolutely <em>could not</em> let Triboulet reach the hotel and assassinate his Master.

&quot;...You fucking bitch. I&#39;ll shove that knife down your throat!&quot; Bill growled, knowing that Triboulet couldn&#39;t hear him, but shouted his lungs out nonetheless. He then disappeared in the shadows, immediately taking chase.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet immersed herself in the swarm of Berenice traffic. Trying to find her amidst the crowd, even in that gaudy outfit of hers, would have been akin to playing a gigantic game of <em>Where&#39;s Waldo?</em> She was fortunate that she was dealing with an Archer, who worked best at range. But if there was no target for them to hit, what good were they?

So long as she could avoid Bill, she&#39;d be safe. The hotel was close. She could feel it thanks to the trail the brat&#39;s friend had left. Just one knife to the neck and it would all be over.

<em>BANG!</em>

As if to ruin her hopes, she instinctively flinched at the sound of a gunshot being fired. It made her want to take cover, because she knew that type of projectile would be unfortunately lethal. Thankfully, her head was still intact and she had no signs of strange holes on her body. Instead, most people continued walking, though some momentarily paused at the odd sound they had just heard.

Screams then followed. People were petrified. Triboulet couldn&#39;t exactly get a good view due to her stature, but she could see a puddle of blood underneath someone&#39;s feet. If she took a closer peek, she would see that a corpse was lying on the ground with a bullet hole to the head. No doubt this was Bill&#39;s handiwork, but what was he trying to accomplish? He  had missed his target completely and killed an innocent bystander instead. Was he just going to kill everyone in Berenice? Was he that desperate?

No. Wait. This beast was far more treacherous than she had imagined. Triboulet noticed that everyone had paused to stare at the body in a mixture of shock and awe. She was the only one looking agitated and antsy, ready to jet for the hotel.

If she started moving abruptly now, then-

&quot;My god,&quot; she said above the voices of the crowd, &quot;that man&#39;s dead!  Quick, look through his pockets!&quot;

Comedy.  The salve of life.  The one reliable friend in despair.  Humans have been looking for ways to get ignore the tumult and pain of living since the first man bonked his head on a tree branch while he wasn&#39;t looking.  Some strive to fulfill themselves with comedy, letting it be a regular aspect of their lives - others outwardly scorn it and are called humorless, but even they have little points where they can&#39;t help but chuckle.  Some make it their living, even, to spread laughter through their quick tongues and ample wit.

Triboulet made it a living in a very literal sense.

As soon as the crowd had started to disperse from the gunshot, she knew that she wasn&#39;t going to have much chance - she could hide, she was short enough to hide under anyone here, but that&#39;d slow her down and turn this from a mad dash to rescue into cat and mouse.  Bill must&#39;ve been watching from an ample vantage point, and the minute her tawny little head poked out from the sea of robes, she&#39;d lose it.

Unless, of course, she did something really funny.

The fool slid down to the corpse&#39;s side, her arms fumbling around for a moment as she sat there in mock eulogy.  Bill had full sight of her now, and was just as liable to shoot her, but what she did next...

...brazenly pickpocketing the body in broad daylight and full view of everyone, and pulling out the most unlikely of things...

&quot;Ah, what a shame!&quot; she said, pulling out a ripe banana from the man&#39;s pocket.  &quot;He went to meet God without his final meal.  I weep for the loss of this one fruit, with no one left to eat it.&quot;

Right afterward, in rapid succession, hands twirled over themselves in drunken flurry to pull out a comically long string of handkerchiefs.  &quot;The man&#39;s nose must&#39;ve run quite a lot - how unfortunate that he couldn&#39;t run with such vigor!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122585706540318782 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122585706540318782><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 12:54 PM">12:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...and Bill found that he couldn&#39;t shoot her.

The first shot was blocked by a passing body that moved into his aim at the very last moment, adding a middle-aged woman to the outlaw&#39;s body count.  The next shot blew out the pocket watch that Triboulet was holding up to the sunlight, missing her hand by a millimeter or more - &quot;They say time stops when you lose a loved one, but this is ridiculous!&quot; - and landed in the dirt behind her.

The third shot was a dud.  

A dud?!  Had he ever had a dud bullet on him since becoming a Servant?  Was that even <em>possible?</em>  Far be it from our good friend Cherokee Bill to understand the fine details of his existence, but he could recall some nonsense about his weapons being comprised of the same mana as the rest of his container.  Mana doesn&#39;t misfire!

He would be able to clear the jam without much thought, and bring his revolver to bear once again, but when he looked down the length of its barrel he found Triboulet&#39;s face - her queasy, greasy, annoying little goblin face - looking back up at him, smile broader and more evil than anything she&#39;s given him before.  The two shots were enough to find out where she was being shot from.  By the look on her face alone, she felt zero pressure about being under the sights of a world-class gunman, standing up and continuing some pointless comedic bit about life insurance that had only gotten some from the crowd to shout at her to start running already.

What was it?  What made her so secure in this?  What kind of nonsense did she have in her pocket, besides all the random junk she was pulling out for cheap sleight-of-hand tricks?!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Only someone who was desperately in need to get somewhere would ignore a corpse. It didn&#39;t necessarily narrow it down to Triboulet, but reducing the sample size from a hundred to around 5 targets made it a lot easier for someone like Bill to eliminate a target.

Much to his surprise, however, Triboulet didn&#39;t make any effort to hide. She waltzed up to the corpse in a cartoonish fashion, then started running her mouth. He could barely hear her from a distance, being perched up on a balcony that was half a mile away. An open view was all he needed for him to be able to kill. Back in his life, he would take potshots at people from at least a mile away. As a Servant? He was confident he could do so much more.

<em>BANG!</em>

Another bullet fired, though this time, things had changed. He had hit another bystander, causing him to cringe in disgust. Hitting people accidentally was one of the worst sins a gunslinger could commit, a total waste of a bullet. He made sure his second shot wouldn&#39;t make the same mistake.

But it did, narrowly grazing Triboulet by hitting a watch in her hand instead. A third bullet immediately followed, or at least, it would have, if Bill&#39;s pistol had not jammed.

How likely was it for a Servant&#39;s own weapon to jam? Bill wasn&#39;t a genius, but even he could tell that something was up. The shit eating grin on Triboulet&#39;s grin simply confirmed it, as he glared at her with the rage of a burning sun.

<em>&quot;Ohhhh, it&#39;s on, bitch.&quot;</em> He promised her that much, leaving his vantage point and making himself scarce. First the wolfman, then the Saber, and now even this midget of a clown was immune to his bullets?! What had the world come to?!?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122630514122170428 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122630514122170428><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 3:52 PM">3:52 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
A minute passed as Triboulet spent more time making jokes to herself as the crowd gradually dispersed, feeling like their lives were at risk after witnessing the deaths of two strangers. The police would no doubt be called soon, but Assassin knew that they were no threat to her. Her only enemy was Bill, but she hadn&#39;t been shot at in a while.

Had he decided to let her go? No, he was most likely still on pursuit. A change of strategy, perhaps? Maybe he had figured out that her protection came from her &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;humor&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; and was waiting for her to slip?

Of course not! Bill looked far too dumb to figure that out. He was probably crying to himself in a corner, whining about how unfair it was for Triboulet to be immune to his only attack worth a damn. Ah, so sad!

<em>BANG!</em>

There it was, another gunshot! Perhaps it was due to the thrill of being chased or the idea of Bill being depressed, but Triboulet would feel quite happy about another bullet being fired. After all, it basically confirmed to her that Bill was still shooting at her. In other words, he was wasting his time on an immovable object.

But nothing came. She could look around herself for a whole minute, but there was no sign of a bullet aimed for her. The only thing she noticed was a cracked window with a hole on it. Had her ability deflected the projectile over there? Strange. Wouldn&#39;t she have noticed then?

<em>squawk squawk-</em>

A pigeon then dropped down at her feet, dead and bloodied. Its entire head had been torn off, severed by a piece of lead. A faint glimmer of a bullet. It was a haunting sight, especially since she hadn&#39;t even <strong>heard</strong> the sound of a bullet this time around.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122630535601205392 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122630535601205392><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 3:52 PM">3:52 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; A familiar voice rung into her hers. That same sloppy and ignorant tone that belonged to lowborn scum. Without a doubt, it was Bill. &quot;look who the cat dragged in. A runaway clown. One having the time of her life, too.&quot; He laughed, his voice echoing across the empty street as Assassin felt like it belonged to one of the nearby buildings. Which one exactly, she couldn&#39;t tell.

&quot;So much for wanting to experience art and all that bull crap. When the chips are down, I guess yer just like the rest, arentcha?&quot; Bill asked with a taunting tone. He was obviously trying to rile her up, maybe to get her to stop talking and get a cheap shot in. But Assassin was no fool, unlike her namesake. Archer might be acting tough now, but he was still the one on the ropes.

Besides, he had made a critical misstep: Hiding was fine and dandy, but had he even noticed the wound on his leg? Probably not, like the stupid, dog of a brute he was. A dried trail of blood could be seen in the distance, one leading to a building directly to Triboulet&#39;s right. The handle looked broken and coincidentally enough, the broken window with the bullet hole in it belonged to the same building.

Ain&#39;t that a laugh?

With hesitation, she drew herself out of the routine.  Her hands kept low in anticipation...the odds of him leaving were slim, yes, but what if?  What he just decided to let her mess around and waste a whole minute?  Was he that smart?  That even-tempered, to leave her without a single scratch on her face (besides all the others he&#39;d previously given)?  No, he&#39;d shout and wave his fist like a cartoon character, and...

...

...

...oh, maybe he really is--

<em>BANG</em>

Triboulet froze up, arms twisting in an unusual self-defensive posture, one leg rising, and then she fell over in her stupor.  Funny in its own right, but not intentionally for once.  After a moment of panic she looked around, keeping her posture locked in vain hope that being a knocked-over statue was somehow funny enough to warrant survival.  The cracked window...but how would he have pulled that off, if not for being able to arc his bullets?  He couldn&#39;t possibly do that, could he?

The bird was even more puzzling, as it landed right into her ground-view.  One second she was alone, and the next she had 4/5ths of a bird laying down on the street with her.  She stood upright and then intentionally fell into a somersault this time, hoping to keep the comedy away from the morbid thing - how did Bill pull that one off?  She imagined she knew everything there was to know about the man, but she was far from clear now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122678688438296656 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122678688438296656><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 7:04 PM">7:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With Bill calling out from the shadows, Triboulet tried to move around in as many varied ways as she could - skipping, jumping, cartwheeling, whatever maintained some modicum of humor.  This was a questionable strategy, as it simply made her look <s>more</s> insane <s>than usual</s>.  Her head twisted left and right, trying to suss out the source of the voice.

&quot;You didn&#39;t give me much choice,&quot; she said back, the streets carrying her words along in an echo.  The only sounds that these two didn&#39;t make were those of the birds in the air and distant sirens.  &quot;You...just happened to be my enemy today.  What poor luck.&quot;  On whose part?  &quot;It&#39;s not like you even wanted to <em>experience art</em> yourself, you rabid dog...&quot;

She rolled, inconspicuously in the direction of the trail.  If she was being watched from a window, she wanted him to have the slightest amount of time to realize she was about to find him as possible.  Getting rid of Bill now would save her an unimaginable amount of trouble later, far better than the pity she&#39;d have.  &quot;I suppose we had ourselves just a fine &#39;nuff time together.  I&#39;m pleased.  We managed to engage in just about every Deadly Sin I can think of in a few hours.  Art, in and of itself.&quot;

She fell face-first into the sand before the building and then stood back upright with one push of the hand.  Then, instantly,
&quot;Oh wait, I forgot one - murder!&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">Triboulet mixed up her list of divine prohibitions.  Please forgive her.</span>

I don&#39;t wanna be known for shooting down clowns.&quot; While Assassin performed more cartwheels, she could hear Bill&#39;s laughter in the distance, sounding about as mocking as usual. &quot;And hey, yer the one who didn&#39;t want to finish watching <em>Shaft.</em> Pretentious fuckwit!&quot;

He quieted down as Triboulet caught a whiff of his trail, noticing the blood that led to the nearby building. She slowly approached, feeding him more small talk as she did. He found it rather amusing.

&quot;Bahahahah! Ya call that a night? Man, if you&#39;d seen the type of shit outlaws do-&quot; He paused as Triboulet slammed her face down the sand, almost like he was being polite. Once she reemerged, he continued.

&quot;-I had fun though.&quot;

<em>CRASH!</em>

Triboulet jumped inside the building, crashing through the glass window as she held her knife in hand. Her body was poised and ready to attack. Her senses were sharp like the finest blade. She felt like she could murder the king again, never mind a lowly peon like Bill.

The building was shrouded in darkness, barely visible thanks to the dim light pooling in from the cracked window. A strong, musky aroma could be felt inside, almost as if the Assassin had just entered a stable. Was Bill that filthy of a man? She&#39;d be sure to give him some tips for better hygiene before killing him.

If she could find him first, that is. She looked far and wide, but the trail of blood ran cold, gradually disappearing into faint droplets. There was no footsteps, just dust and dark. The building looked fairly old, even by Berenice standards. Old, moldy wood that creaked at the step and gave away her position with every slight movement. Wonderful.

But if that were the case, she should surely be able to hear the much heavier Bill? How had the cowboy managed to vanish like a ghost?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122982904637689876 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122982904637689876><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 3:13 PM">3:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>woosh</em>

A tumbleweed had appeared, rolling up to her like a soccer ball from a darkened hallway. That&#39;s when Assassin&#39;s alarm bells started ringing. One, tumbleweeds didn&#39;t just appear out of nowhere, especially inside of a building of all things. Two, the building had an eerie presence to it, from the darkness to the old d&#233;cor. It was as if she had entered a different time.

But on the bright side, she had found a lead! A trail of blood appeared in front of her, right beside the tumbleweed. It was fresh, and still dripping! It pointed towards the darkened hallway, which meant that-

Pain. So much pain. Triboulet felt like a giant wasp had just stung her in the shoulder. She looked down, noticing that the trail had coalesced into one single point: <em>Her.</em> She took a close look at herself and saw a hole on her shoulder, fresh and round. Clearly the mark of a gunshot. The hallway also flashed white for a split second before returning to pure darkness.

That fucker had shot her, before she could even crack out one of her jokes. But how? When?! All she saw was a flash of light, yet no gunfire or fanfare. It seemed like Bill had a few tricks up his own sleeve....and it pissed her right off. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man had his tricks, but he was a simple man; guns first, questions later, higher thought never.  She just had to find him and best him in the close, which she imagined was her one advantage in this match.  The floors creaked as she almost swaggered down the halls in drunken euphoria.

&quot;...A lot of good that hiding will do you,&quot; she shouted into the empty space.  &quot;Assassins, we&#39;re all fine scenthounds as much as we are the fox running away.  Just keep running, you daft bastard, just keep running...&quot;

She kept talking.  She didn&#39;t need stealth now.  In fact, she <em>wanted</em> the bastard to hear her coming.  She was consumed with a poisonous mixture of pride and anger - the sense of invulnerability, the pain of being used, the thrill of the hunt, the desire to get back at someone who had gotten her to concede.  Nothing could stop her now, and in all, it made this fool a real idiot.

&quot;In fact, you called me a pretentious fuckwit,&quot; she called through the dank halls.  &quot;I&#39;ll tell ya, good sir, that&#39;s the finest badge of honor I&#39;ve been handed all day.&quot;  Her breathing took on an excited note as her adrenaline dulled the earlier pain further.  &quot;You could pop out right now, and maybe I&#39;d let you be!  That&#39;s how good it was.&quot;

The blood was coming to its trailhead, and mystery basket of weeds or no, she could taste this bit of comeuppance.  Her life was built around extracting comeuppance, as if it was drafted by an architect of the school of slights.  Everything good that he&#39;d given her in the day prior was about to be burnt out in one last burst of pointless gloating and violence, and by god, did it excite her!  This must be the kind of murderous joy that Bill yammered on about; she couldn&#39;t wait to give him what for!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122996032272351414 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122996032272351414><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 4:05 PM">4:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;But you and I know,&quot; she was about to turn the corner, &quot;I&#39;m not to be tr--&quot;

Triboulet stopped.  She reached up to her shoulder with a trembling hand - blood.  Fresh, and unmistakeably hers.  She stood there for a moment, pain infusing her, in <em>disbelief</em> that this happened at all.  Then, she slumped over, stumbling to the side.  Bad time to be her, but she wouldn&#39;t be taking a single step more in pursuit of the bandit.  She bit down on her tongue to keep anything more than tears from coming out as she slammed into the wall, unable to keep steady on her feet.

That&#39;s just what happens to this one fool, whenever she wants to get a leg up on someone else.  It always comes back to bite her in the ass!

She slid down the wall, trying to force her legs, which felt faint, to keep herself upright.  A trail of fresh red was marked on the wall at the end point of the trail.  She looked around - where the hell did the shot even come from?  What kind of gunman was he to shoot so silently and run his mouth all day?  She didn&#39;t...my god, she didn&#39;t even try to keep the humor alive...

&quot;Gghhk...you...penetrate a woman...behind,&quot; she barely stammered out, her grit teeth not at all smiling.  &quot;That&#39;s...worst thing you&#39;ve done...all day.&quot;

Her hand dropped her knife.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She felt ecstatic, surrounded by an exhilarating feeling of overwhelming conquest. The same type of adrenaline that made her think she could take down one of France&#39;s greatest rulers. This type of overconfidence was lethal, but she was far too drunk and high to realize the folly of her ways. A fool to the very end.

Blood dripped from her shoulder and ruined her clothes. She felt a lot lighter than usual, looking airheaded and silly. She limped around, landing on a wall to hold herself up before sliding down and hitting rock bottom. Her body screamed to run, but her legs remained immobile. A combination of shock, being drunk and the mana slowly leaving through her injuries was enough to keep her stuck in place. How could Bill be such an annoying loudmouth yet kill with such silent efficiency?

<em>clang</em>

She dropped the knife to the floor, cracking another crude joke as she did. Despite that, there was always a double meaning to Assassin&#39;s jokes. It was subtle, but she had managed to catch a glimpse at Archer&#39;s attack. He hadn&#39;t shot her from the darkness of the hallway. No, it was just a trick of the light. In reality, Bill had shot her just seconds before she noticed, with some ability that had masked the perception of his bullets.

What ability that was, she had no goddamn clue. If anything, Assassin felt lucky enough to come up with this estimate in the first place.

A chilly wind then entered the room, the darkness brewing as leathery strips started to stick out. A coat followed suit, looking more like a massive cloak. Green, furious eyes then followed as the man known as Cherokee Bill made himself known, as if to congratulate Triboulet for her keen senses.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123024566319583384 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123024566319583384><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 5:58 PM">5:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Heh heh. Good one.&quot; Bill graced her with one laugh, albeit it sounded more like an insult coming from him. &quot;Poor choice of <em>last words</em> though.&quot; He took a step, then another, slowly inching towards Assassin to let her savor the entire experience. From the adrenaline rush a moment earlier to the hopeless terror that she felt now. Bill was taking her on a carousel of emotions.

&quot;Worst thing I&#39;ve done all day? <em>I can fix that.&quot;</em> Bill grinned, then Assassin&#39;s vision went black as she felt an anvil fall down her head.

<em>STOMP!</em>

A kick right to her beautiful smile, tarnishing the golden image of a cheerful jester. Her head hit the back of the wall from the impact, cracking something and blurring her vision. Bill didn&#39;t stop either, using his boot to take kicks at the woman&#39;s cheek, causing her to fall down to her side. It was only two kicks, but she already knew it was over. Bill was just toying with his prey at this point, most likely having sinister ideas in that sick mind of his on what to do with her. Even worse, it had already started: She could taste iron on her lips, but it wasn&#39;t her blood; she had already had her fill of it. Instead, it tasted sweet and salty, feeling more like that of a man&#39;s blood. She then took a close look at the leg that was kicking her.

He was using his injured leg. As if to say that this was payback. A disgusting mutt till the very end...

&quot;What? No more jokes? Hmph.&quot; Bill shook his head, looking disappointment. <em>&quot;Why the hell did I catch myself a clown then?&quot;</em>

<em>THUMP!</em>
<em>SLAM!</em>

Triboulet&#39;s spine felt like giving out. Bill had gotten bored of the kicks, so instead he used everything else at his disposal. He slammed down his full body on Triboulet, pressing his weight against hers as he wrapped one of his arms around her neck while his torso pushed down hers. He held her tighter than a lover&#39;s embrace, which would be a romantic prospect if she didn&#39;t feel like her lungs were being crushed out of air in that moment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123024614705074297 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123024614705074297><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 5:58 PM">5:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
With one free arm left, he took out his gun and pointed at the jester&#39;s forehead. A <em>clic</em> could be heard as it was now primed to fire.

Well, of all the ways to go, this was humiliating. Very much so. Triboulet couldn&#39;t believe that she was being delivered such an horrific fate once more. Even as a Servant, she never got the chance to change her life. She wondered if James would fare any better-

Then her eyes flashed white, blinded by a strong sunlight. The tumbleweed rolled back into view as the building&#39;s musky aroma started to assault her yet again. The glass window had been replaced by a much older frame, one letting in copious amounts of sunlight that seemed far too bright for even Berenice. 

She then felt her neck strain as Bill cupped her cheek, forcing her to take a closer look. Various tables were now sprawled across the room, tipped over and damaged as if a scuffle had just happened. Playing cards and booze were also lying around, along with a huge sign that said &#39;Saloon&#39;. If she didn&#39;t know any better she would say this was-

&quot;Noble Phantasm.&quot; Bill whispered to her, cheek-to-cheek. <strong>&quot;Ballad of Cherokee Bill.&quot;</strong> He muttered, much to her confusion. What the hell was this buffoon talking about? 

&quot;Ya wanted my Noble Phantasm, didn&#39;t cha?&quot; The cowboy asked with a tilt of the head. &quot;Well, ya got first class seats to it now! How&#39;d ya think I snuck up on ya, or got tha chance to kick yer face silly?&quot; He asked, making Triboulet reevaluate their encounter. The tumbleweeds, the aged buildings, the lack of sound...Were they all related to Bill&#39;s Noble Phantasm? Was this his trump card that allowed him to have an edge over her?

No, there was most likely something else to it, but Triboulet didn&#39;t count on Bill revealing all of his tricks. She did <em>only</em> ask for his Noble Phantasm, after all. Curse her for not being more greedy...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123024658204217495 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123024658204217495><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 5:59 PM">5:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Oh well. Not like it mattered. Her life was over now, about to end at the hands of a mad dog that loved gloating-

Bill released her hold, her face falling flat on the floor in a comedic fashion. She felt her entire body become lighter as the fat ass cowboy finally got off her petite frame. This is why she hated bedding tall people.

&quot;There,&quot; Bill said, sounding perky and proud of himself. &quot;hope that satisfied, ya weird ass midget!&quot; He said in a joking tone, as if addressing a friend instead of a sworn enemy. &quot;I kept my end of tha bargain, so how about ya keep yours, hmm?&quot; Without even waiting for her to recover, he immediately confronted her with another demand. Selfish prick!

&quot;Oh and, sorry about tha rough treatment. I can&#39;t letcha get to my Master or hurt him so....ya know.&quot; Bill hid his gaze with his cowboy hat, as if knowing that was a shit excuse. But hey, at least he apologized! That had to count for something, right?

<em><strong>NOT.</strong></em>

&quot;But ya run faster than a hamster on a spinning wheel, especially with this shit ya did to me.&quot; He groaned, pointing to his injured leg. &quot;So yea. We&#39;re even here. But, if ya hear my proposal, I&#39;ll make it lucrative...&quot; He did a light nod, attempting to persuade Assassin to listen to him. What a poor fool. Did he really think Triboulet wouldn&#39;t notice him clutching at the gun in his pocket? Of course she knew what would happen if she refused his proposal.

But she had to admit, for Bill to &#39;spare&#39; her was already quite different from where they had started. What an odd fellow. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The snarl she gave him turned to horror with the next, and then to a half-present stare.  Her mouth opened even with the pain wracking her face, but instead of any attempt at humor, she coughed and spat and did what she could to keep blood from flowing down her throat.  Her hands raised, not in immediate defense but for a vague method of trying to find any, <em>any</em> joke she could, but they were pressed flat and away from her.  Bill stomped on her hand once, and she could feel them threaten to snap.

Removed from her immortality and her ever-tricky nature, she was that fragile, wasn&#39;t she?  A little malformed lump that could be scraped away with impunity.

A moment of peace between them got her to the point that she was laying forward, hand over hand as she tried to find purchase in the knots of the wood floor below her - she looked over her shoulder and tried to blurt out something at him, but she was then crushed down to the ground.  Her lungs burned, but the wound...pressed down like this her pain was exacerbated greatly.

Never in life had she been hurt like this - stabbed once or twice, beaten often, but it felt like something had been thoroughly shattered where the bullet passed through.  It was a brilliant pain, and her vision went in and out from its strength alone.  In that moment, she actually managed a faint <em>&quot;Please...&quot;</em> with the last supply in her lungs, but that just drained them out faster.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123398915560050820 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123398915560050820><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 27, 2023 6:46 PM">6:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It really was a humiliating way to die.  No last words on her part, no soliloquoy like the greats of the stage, and nothing like a fair end.  Death, deprived of everything that had characterized her life, felt the same as becoming a pathetic nobody.  Exiled from France altogether, becoming nothing more than a dwarf of foreign status in a strange place and dwindling away to nothing.  To Bill, she was that - nobody, now.

She didn&#39;t imagine she would ever be so misfortunate as to come back, so she figured that was it.  <em>Fini.</em>

...only that it wasn&#39;t.  She waited for him to pull her neck back further and break it, or cut her throat, or something worse, but she was spared anything besides a forceful look.  Once she understood what Bill was getting at...she felt like this was all very stupid.  Dying just to fulfill a contract made under the influence of spirits...man, that was <em>dumb.</em>  And, you know what?  That just makes her death a little better.

Death didn&#39;t come for her though, not yet.  She was freed from his crush at the very least, and could look back up at him as he rose with one eye.  She sat there, and stared, and listened, and listened...

...Insult.  Screw death, no, <em>welcome,</em> death.  Better that than see this man act like they were best of friends as she&#39;s at her end!  Can&#39;t let her touch his Master, huh?  Couldn&#39;t shoot her fucking leg off instead of all that mess?  What did she even get out of this besides a showing of something she chose just because she&#39;s unoriginal and short-sighted?  Goddamn, man, couldn&#39;t give her a...

...

...well, from Bill&#39;s perspective, she stared at him from the ground, head to her side and one eye wide open, for some time.  It wasn&#39;t easy to gauge if she really had died somehow, and would disappear in a golden mist the next moment.  Triboulet waited to speak, and whether it was disbelief or hesitation, but when she did speak it was short and quiet - not like she had much strength in that moment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123398992013824021 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123398992013824021><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 27, 2023 6:46 PM">6:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>&quot;Talk already.

Rude bitch.&quot; Bill replied in kind to Triboulet&#39;s remarks. Not like anybody could blame her after that defeat, especially with the way Archer was acting. If he wanted kindness, well, he should start by setting an example first.

&quot;Like I said, <strong>I wanna hire you.</strong> Yer an Assassin, right? Then I wantcha to assassinate <em>anyone</em> who threatens the life of a specific person.&quot; Bill explained, rubbing his hands together. &quot;That would be my <strong>Master.</strong> Name&#39;s Lachlan Dowling something. So long as yer alive, I want you to keep an eye on him.&quot;

If Triboulet&#39;s own request was dull and short-sighted, then Bill was ridiculous in comparison: He was going to ask an <em>enemy</em> Servant to guard his <em>own</em> Master? Did he even realize why Servants were assigned a Master in the first place? To prevent two-timing idiots from existing! And now he was asking her to become one?

Should she feel flattered? Shocked? Amused? Why was he going to such lengths to protect a Master that he had happily ditched just hours ago?

&quot;Ya look pretty beat up.&quot; Bill pointed out, as if most of those injuries hadn&#39;t come from himself. &quot;Tell ya what. Do this for me and I&#39;ll spare that Master of yers too while I&#39;m at it. An aye for an aye.&quot; The cowboy tipped his hat. This kind of attitude also felt sickening. Did Bill really expect he could act all nice and chill after the torture from earlier? No wonder he was known as a mad dog...

&quot;I don&#39;t like being rough with women so-&quot; He coughed, justifying himself while adding more fuel to Triboulet&#39;s fire. &quot;-I guess even someone like you would be considered one.&quot; Ohhhh, this little prick.

Her body wracked with a cough that produced more blood, and she strained to turn her neck up to get a better look at the Archer.  No question about her being alive now, though it was probably tenuous - that she could move at all bode well.

Triboulet had never imagined a Servant to be the sort of thing you &#39;hire&#39;.  Contract, most certainly, but the realm of mercantile exchange seemed like something that mortals do.  Even if she wasn&#39;t being &#39;paid&#39; in any way besides sparing Bill the few cents in brass it took to shoot her and James.  She gathered enough strength in her unsteady face to squint at him.  &quot;You...don&#39;t say.&quot;  She coughed, falling back to the ground but picking herself up once again.  &quot;Friend...if you win this, <strong>wish for half a brain.</strong>  I doubt...it&#39;s even in God&#39;s power to give <em>you</em> a full one...&quot;  Her arm was further stained red as she wiped her face with it - she found it almost limp as she tried to pull it up.  Worrying.

Even at death&#39;s door, she couldn&#39;t help but be an ass, could she?  If there was one thing that Bill could appreciate, or one good quality among the many bad, it&#39;s that she never seemed to know when to give up.  It could be a negative, and it probably was, but she has to at least have some good in her, right?

&quot;Considering...your other option, presented to me...is that we continue our fight...can I do anything but accept?&quot;  She had pulled herself from the ground and lay back-to-the-wall, breathing heavily in an attempt to recompose herself.  &quot;You&#39;re a rat bastard.  A terrible negotiator...if I were to accept this, I would be a complete fool.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1124399026725466224 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1124399026725466224><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 30, 2023 1:00 PM">1:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her hand reached over for her knife.  It would be in Bill&#39;s better judgment to take the shot here and now, show off that speedy draw of his, and not take the chance - but even so, Triboulet lived.  She did not attack him.  Her knife was stuffed back to whatever well-hidden sheathe she kept on her backside, after some scooting and fumbling.

&quot;...just...when we get there,&quot; she started to rise, steady at first but bracing herself after her legs wobbled, &quot;point out which one this Dowling fellow is.  I&#39;m a skilled master of discerning...one upper-class fuckwit from a room of many others, but I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not on the top of my game today.&quot;  If Bill was a kind gentleman, she&#39;d find that his offer of a hand was rejected.

&quot;You have your deal, for what manner of trust you can place in...an underhanded, conniving clown.  Nothing besides that, though.&quot;  Her eye turned to him with a certain level of unpleasant distaste.  &quot;I&#39;m calling this expedition of ours off.  We learned nothing and we wasted just about every coin we could.  Our actions...have done nothing but shame us as so-called &#39;Heroic&#39; Spirits - we acted as inbred, uncouth and downright nasty street rats.  We may well be exiled from the Throne for all that we have done today.&quot;

...a slight smile came out past the streaks of blood.  &quot;I think that&#39;s a day well spent.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just someone flexing their use of force under the pretense of &#39;goodwill&#39;. Well, not like she was exactly wrong, though he always found it funny how people on death&#39;s door were always such a talkative bunch. Were they that excited to die, or did they have nothing to lose?

He couldn&#39;t judge himself. Especially after what happened at the hanging. He probably talked the executioner&#39;s ears off on that day, letting all of his emotions out before he got silenced. Triboulet was doing the same, making sure Bill knew exactly what she thought of him. Even if he was in a position of power, she&#39;d rather bite off her own tongue than kowtow to him. Someone headstrong and determined, despite their frailty and short stature.

She really did remind him of her. His idiotic sister. Got herself roped into a loveless marriage, yet didn&#39;t as much shed a tear as she persevered. He could still remember her slaps and grumbling when he killed her abuser, calling him an utter moron and telling him to keep trouble out of the family&#39;s name. There were no records of her after his death, since she was as plain and simple as they come. Bill hoped that she had lived a good life, but he knew that history would never give him the answer that he was looking for. After all, his sister never picked up the gun. How could she ever hope to be remembered that way?

Maybe that&#39;s why he held a soft spot for women like her. Including annoying midgets like Triboulet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1125537287762092123 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1125537287762092123><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 3, 2023 4:23 PM">4:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Cats and dogs do just fine without a brain. Yer really overrating it.&quot; Bill replied with a grin, as if his interjection was supposed to be a witty comeback. If anything, it simply confirmed how much of a dunce he was. At least he was smart enough to understand Assassin&#39;s request, the woman explaining that it was impossible for her to protect someone if she didn&#39;t at least know their face. A reasonable ask, though it could quickly turn messy. She could be asking for Lachlan&#39;s face in order to assassinate him the moment Bill reveals them, or she could simply be playing along in order to stab Bill when he least expected it. His fingers were itching for a trigger.

But her smile at the end just confirmed the type of person that Assassin was. One that Bill couldn&#39;t help but nod along with. They talked a lot and he understood very little, but what little he got was enough for him to respect. Or at least, he respected Assassin&#39;s way of fighting back.

&quot;Heheheheh.&quot; Bill laughed, making Triboulet feel almost accomplished with herself. &quot;Yer fecking weird.&quot; He blurted out, raining down her parade. <strong>&quot;But that&#39;s why I like ya.</strong> If I get done in by a clown, I sure as hell deserve it.&quot; 

&quot;Now,&quot; Instead of offering up a hand, like a fine suitor would have, Triboulet would be shocked to see Archer simply turn around and...leave. He disappeared from the building, leaving her alone in the dark and in bloody tatters. What, was he just expecting her to <em>crawl</em> towards him like a fucking snake?! Piece of shit-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1125537339637235742 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1125537339637235742><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 3, 2023 4:23 PM">4:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>SLAM!</em>

The door opened, being kicked out of its hinges as light poured inside. Bill came back, now hollering for Assassin to get a move on. &quot;The hell are ya still doin&#39; here? We going or what?!&quot;

The moment Triboulet finally left the building, she would notice that Bill had taken advantage of the chaos the two of them had caused and grabbed an abandoned contraption.

A food cart. Devoid of food. So just a cart.

There was no mule anywhere, so Bill would do as a (less)handsome replacement. He tapped at the wooden mass, implying that Assassin should get on and make herself comfortable.

&quot;You got a minute to get in. I&#39;m not letting my Master die cuz of yer snail ass.&quot; Archer narrowed his eyes. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Perhaps Bill had said no truth more firm that day than &#39;You&#39;re fecking weird&#39;.  She was.  Few people, if anyone, could take a look at all of this through one bloody eye, barely standing, and find some kind of humor in it.  Ah, if only Triboulet wasn&#39;t the butt of this joke...

The clown closed her eyes and said in response, &quot;Your taste is ill-found - go like something more amenable...to the companionship of humans...like a wild, starving...&quot;

She opened the one eye that didn&#39;t sting from the trickle of blood, and she was graced with the sight of Bill&#39;s backside turned toward her.  Before she could clarify what animal she possibly would be lesser than, he stepped outside, closed the door, and hadn&#39;t so much as said anything beyond &#39;now&#39;.

Now?  Now what?

Triboulet was shocked, alright.  She stood there, jaw open, staring at the closed door in disbelief - that absolute <em>devil!</em>  The spurious, syphilis-riddled, shit-for brains demon!  All this talk of like and being rough with women and then he tosses her ass out like this?  There&#39;s no way, right?  She shouted after him with some remaining strength, &quot;Go stand above a wooden stake and sit right down!  Get buggered by a stake!  Maybe you&#39;ll feel something in that coal-black heart of yours if it goes through your underside...&quot;

She sank back to one knee, leaning against the wall.  Her rampant paranoia and distrust of everyone around her didn&#39;t pay off for once, as she was soon blinded by Bill&#39;s glorious return - alongside that of the illustrious Billmobile, a cart fit for a king.  Triboulet thought that the only time a king deserved to be moved by another being was when his body was being hauled away past execution, so it really was good.

&quot;...Bill.&quot;  She started to pull herself along the wall, and eventually managed a stunted, hunched, unstable pace as she got to the cart.  &quot;Please.  Remember a few things from this trip of ours.  Maybe you&#39;re better off working alone...maybe that&#39;s all you know...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1125864100178694174 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1125864100178694174><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 4, 2023 2:01 PM">2:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She reached the cart.  She could once again feel the heat of the sun on her head, removed from the twilight reality of whatever you could call Bill&#39;s side reality.  It blinded her, but she still looked up to the Archer with squinting eyes.

&quot;...but in the future, <em>explain what you&#39;re doing to others instead of simply</em> doing <em>whatever comes to mind.&quot;</em>

It wasn&#39;t a threat, or an annoyed grievance or an impassioned plea.  Instead, it was something new from her, and it&#39;d be the last time anyone would see it, perhaps in this war, or perhaps ever.  Triboulet, the great fat tick of a perturbance, looked like she was just flat-out <strong>done</strong>.

Congratulations, Cherokee Bill.  Triboulet broke before you did!

With a halting step as it required moving her infirm arm around, she eventually pulled herself up and over the edge of the food cart.  It was more than enough to fit her, but her awkward landing position had her laying horizontally, legs up in the air - and it didn&#39;t look like she was keen on repositioning herself.

&quot;Go on, Bill,&quot; she said, raising her good arm, &quot;go on and git.  Put your legs to use instead of your ingenious mind.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
