&#39;Fuck!&#39;

Glass shattered against the floor, spraying water everywhere. Lachlan slammed his hand down on the counter. He felt nothing. There was no pain, only a numbing sensation traveling up his arm. His fingers trembled slightly. They lacked strength.

He opened the cupboard and reached for a new glass. This one made it halfway to the sink before slipping from his grasp. One blink later and it met the same fate as its predecessor.

<em>God, he was so fucking tired. If only he could get a moment of silence to himself...</em>

His eyes wandered to the cupboard again, where rows of empty glasses of all shapes and sizes stood and flaunted their pristine beauty. And again the voices came for him...screaming, crying, groaning, and cursing, each one reminding him of his utter incompetence the day before. Until he could reestablish full control of Pygmalion, the voices would persist. Twelve minds engaged in an endless debate, leaving little room for his own thoughts...

He stepped over the broken glass. &#39;God damn it,&#39; he said out loud. He reached into the cupboard and swiped at the glasses in a fit of rage, hurling them onto the floor where they exploded into thousands of little pieces.

Then he half-stormed and half-stumbled into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him and barricading himself from the outside world. A haggard face stared back from the vanity mirror, haunted by dark circles under each eye. Unkempt hair, bruised cheek, and a ruined shirt that looked like it had survived an apocalypse completed the look of an unruly drunkard who had been kicked out of a night club in the slums.

&#39;You...are better than this.&#39; His own reflection scowled back doubtfully, as if mocking his own words. 

He reached up to touch the bruise on his cheek. The swelling had gone down, but the bitterness still remained. How dare his own Servant strike him, when he had been nothing but forthcoming?
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108412984872681522 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108412984872681522><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 10:17 AM">10:17 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Looking back at it, his decision to work with Bill had been laughable. In a moment of weakness, he had allowed a sliver of trust to take root, all at the possibility that Bill could offer the partnership he had so promised. They were turning a new page, were they not? As a token of good faith, he had even lent Bill a puppet, had he not? 

But to his dismay, Bill had utterly and irrevocably squandered that trust.

<em>Never again. Never...again.</em>

Lachlan splashed water onto his face, in an attempt to remove the grime from the previous day. When he no longer resembled a hobo from the neck up, he went in search of fresh clothes.

Roland wasn&#39;t anywhere to be found when he returned to the lounge. It took him a moment to recall that he had sent the blonde on an errand to fetch some meds from the nearby pharmacy.

And what about Bill? Lachlan tried to remember, but his mind drew a blank. The events of the past few hours melded into a haze, as his impaired memory struggled to piece them together. Had he sent Bill on an errand as well, or perhaps, severed their contract altogether? Bill was an Archer with Independent Action, unaffected by a severed contract. Lachlan wouldn&#39;t let him off that easy. If he dares to show his face around here again...

He left the thought unfinished, instead venting his frustration by throwing his dirty clothes to the floor. They landed in the pile of broken glass, sending them flying across the room. The once tidy lounge now looked like a warzone, with shards of glass scattered around like landmines. 

Oops.

Feeling completely unapologetic, Lachlan jabbed his finger into the phone dial and requested room service from the front desk. 

&#39;Suite 502, and make it quick...No, I don&#39;t need any complimentary service. I just need someone to clean up this mess...Yes, I&#39;ll be waiting. <em>Yes,</em> I&#39;ll pay for the damage...nothing else was broken. Just send someone up here, will you?&#39;

Soon James felt the drawbacks of losing sleep begin to creep into his body. His eyes hung heavier with each passing day. Fatigue found its way into his muscles. However, he knew what he signed up for when he came out here. He knew it wasn&#39;t going to be easy. What he wouldn&#39;t give to be able to relax, even if it was for a fleeting moment, like that encounter with Ann. 

Before his thoughts were of her and how she might be doing in this War, he continued on with his task.

Following the clues and hints granted by Ruler, James narrowed down the location to a hotel. With hundreds of rooms to search through, he could very well be here for the next few days. James had a plan though. 

&quot;Shhhh...&quot; 

A soft thud followed the soothing calls of sleep as James incapacitated one of the hotel employees. A single use of his Mystic Eyes and he was able to search through the memories of this particular employee to see what information he could gleam from them. 

Scheduling. Worthless. Thoughts about the receptionist. Irrelevant. Gossip in the staff room. Juicy, but pointless. Room service call. Nothin-wait.

In that memory contained an important piece of information. On the terminal when this man was asked to go clean up a certain suite, a name stuck out to him; a Mr. Dowling. Suite 502. Perfect.

After dumping the employee into one of the stalls in the bathroom where James dragged the man into, he headed up to Suite 502 in his place. 

This was a risky maneuver without Assassin. However, he can simply back out if the presence of a Servant became known after all. 

Time went by with no knocks upon Suite 502&#39;s door. Was room service this horrendously slow? Perhaps they messed up his Suite for another. Maybe there was a backlog that needed to be dealt with first. 

<em>knock knock knock</em>

&quot;Room Service.&quot; Whatever reason may have been the case was of no matter anymore once the arrival of another reached his door.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108836359327727706 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108836359327727706><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 2:19 PM">2:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then came the relentless stomping of footsteps, as they grew louder with each passing second. Whoever occupied the room clearly had no intention of tiptoeing around, much to the woes of their poor neighbors one floor below..

Then the door swung open, and a young man with red hair poked through the gap, a deep scowl etched on his pale face. There was the face of someone who could really use a few more hours of sleep.

&#39;You&#39;re <em>late</em>!&#39; 

He slammed the door in James&#39; face. 

What on earth had just happened? Had James been denied entry to the very service he had been summoned to provide? Had he blown his cover? Had—

The door creaked opened once again. This time, Lachlan held it wide, his expression somewhat more composed than before. &#39;Well, come in then. Don&#39;t just stand there,&#39; he stated, as if he hadn&#39;t just shut the door on James himself.

Though irritation still permeated his voice, Lachlan stepped aside, allowing his cleaner to enter. He leaned against the door to keep it open, then gestured towards the mess near the kitchenette with a nod.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108860153211662527 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108860153211662527><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 18, 2023 3:54 PM">3:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sure, he was wearing a more casual get-up than the other employees. Sure, he had his shades on. But to be figured out this quickly? It left an expression of shock on his face. Fortunately it made his act all the more convincing when the door was opened yet again though.

&quot;Uh, thank you...Sir.&quot; Great, a new hire <em>and</em> he&#39;s old. This won&#39;t be over anytime soon from the looks of it. 

The sounds of the cart used to carry all the supplies one would need to clean up a room rumbled into the room. The room was a <em>mess</em>. For a second, he figured someone else made an attempt on his life. James needed the perfect moment to spring his attack on Lachlan. So, to kill time and to avoid suspicion, James searched for wherever the employee placed his dustpan and hand broom so he could begin to sweep up the glass shards.

A bandage wrapping covered his hand to hide the Command Seals on it. Hopefully, this would be enough to buy him a handful of minutes. He didn&#39;t need much. He just needed enough.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109203896909430845 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109203896909430845><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 19, 2023 2:40 PM">2:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

James, familiar with the layout and amenities typically found in such households, would have little trouble navigating his way around...if it weren&#39;t for the absolute disarray that had desecrated the place. Glass shards scattered everywhere, not just on the floor, but finding their way into the nooks and crannies as well. Table, chairs...no furnishing was exempt. It seemed that he had quite the work cut out for him.

At the end of the lounge located four doors, no doubt leading to the private quarters, closets, and other spaces provided by the hotel. All of them were tightly shut except for one, which made it hard to discern whether other inhabitants currently occupied the rooms. After all, who would bother coming out to greet a mere cleaner?

No one but the master of the house, of course!

Lachlan followed James back inside. He shut the door behind them, but didn&#39;t bother locking it. After all, this was supposed to be a quick cleaning job. By his estimate, James should in out the door in several minutes. 

Without making much of a fuss, he settled into a chair by the counter, drawing his legs up to avoid stepping on the glass himself. Then he began to watch.

A minute passed. Then two. Several minutes went by in a flash, but the rhythmic sweeps of the broom continued to echo throughout the room...

The Dowling heir sighed.

No longer content with being a spectator, he began to criticize James&#39; every move, sounding more and more like some entitled brat as he channeled his foul mood by picking on the hapless &#39;staff&#39;.

Eventually, he exhausted his critiques on James&#39; cleaning skills, so he shifted his attention to the man himself. 

&#39;They hire temps to do the job now?&#39; He mocked the man, gaze falling upon the bandages wrapped around his hand. &#39;Goodness, you&#39;re already injured. Can&#39;t they find someone better for the job?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109416951735922758 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109416951735922758><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 4:46 AM">4:46 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With each swipe of glass, James took his time to listen out for anyone else in this suite. Any signs. Any <em>noises</em>. Once he decided that it was safe, that is when he would strike. Or cut his losses short, if things were more unsavory for him. 

&quot;Oh. Sorry.&quot; The less he talked, the better it would be for his cover. He didn&#39;t look local, nor did he sound local either. The longer he can avoid the inevitable red flags from cropping up, the better. Interesting how the hotel allowed him to wear shades as well.

Without much words, James took his critiques head-on. Who would have thought that living with a Servant who constantly berated you would have came in handy? This allowed him to work despite the biting words against him. Maybe he should thanks Assassin for that. If he can find a non-backhanded way of presenting it, of course.

&quot;Hard times and all. Can&#39;t be picky with who they choose.&quot; A shrug was done as James kept avoiding from making eye contact with Lachlan. &quot;It was just a cut. Nothing too serious.&quot; His heart kept racing. James wasn&#39;t no actor. The only character he could pull off was himself! Sooner or later his cover is going to be blown.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1109633516578279555 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1109633516578279555><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 20, 2023 7:07 PM">7:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They dress you up quite nicely here. Those shades a perk from work?&#39; He teased the man. 

If anything felt amiss, he passed it off as a byproduct of his sullen mood. Besides, he had never stayed in hotels long enough to acquaint himself with the intricacies of the staffing culture. He had always relied on his personal attendants, and lately, Roland the mutt. All of them dressed much more lavishly than the man in front of him.

But, dear god, this dark-haired man was a <em>bore</em>. Not a change in his reactions even after being berated for his own incompetence. At least Roland, with his constant fidgeting and queasy expressions, provided some form of amusement. And then there were those who reacted like a lit fuse, jumping and yapping like monkeys. Bill instantly came to mind...

His mood soured in an instant. History had an uncanny way of repeating itself. Regardless of the times, it was always those who fell short of greatness that made the most racket. Coincidentally, the ones who had the audacity to challenge him often proved to be the biggest disappointments. The echoes of Archie&#39;s death throes, the tragic downfall of his twin, and now, Bill&#39;s abandonment. How dare he bite back after everything he had promised...

He refused to acknowledge his own shortcomings. Dismissed the idea that the fault might lie with him. Bill had vowed to be his right-hand. Promised to be his gun. Oh no, he couldn&#39;t have made a mistake in his judgement. He hadn&#39;t given the Archer impossible demands. It had to be Bill who had failed to meet his expectations and, as a result, fled like the scoundrel he truly was.

So much so that...

&#39;Let me take a look at your hand.&#39;

...He clamped down on James&#39; wrist as he passed by. His grip was rather weak, but even so, he still acted as if he owned the place and everyone in it. Of course, it wasn&#39;t entirely selflessness that prompted this gesture. Quite on the contrary, the desire to assert his superiority over people, especially after the mess Bill had left behind, was enough to compel him to reward James with something the man had likely never experienced before.

&#39;I&#39;ll perform a magic trick for you,&#39; he said snidely, flexing his magic circuits and activating a basic <strong>Healing</strong> spell. His fingers grazed the outer layers of the bandages as a faint red glow emanated from his touch.

That phrase froze James in place. A thought ran past his mind to equip himself now. Get the jump on him before he got it on him. Sweat collected on his forehead, threatening to drop onto the ground, as he swallowed a lump inside his throat.

The tension was made even worse for him once he felt the hand grab hold of his wrist. It made the man jump a little. It was over.

...Then the offer to heal him was made. The grip around his wrist, despite being weak, still had that firm authority about it. Even if James could easily pry his arm away, it was that authority alone that kept him from doing so. 

&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary, you se-&quot; The healing spell was done. His words were cut off by the glow of the spell on his hand. He needed to bullshit his way through this one. Why would he know about magecraft, after all? He was just an employee at this hotel.

After the spell was finished, James tensed up his hand as if to check for the missing sting of any injuries that were suppose to be present. Of course he felt nothing, though. There wasn&#39;t anything there to start. 

&quot;Huh, now <em>that</em> is something you don&#39;t see every day...&quot; He can only hope that reaction was enough to fool Lachlan, lest until he can get into a better position, of course.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110329059428282491 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110329059428282491><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 5:11 PM">5:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why would I bother lying to a commoner like you?&#39; Lachlan patted James on the hand. &#39;You should consider yourself lucky to have run into me...&#39;

He trailed off, looking again at the oddly-dressed staff, with a face that suggested he was going to faint at any moment. Yes, that was it. That was precisely what he liked to see. He felt James&#39; hand tense up in his grip - nervousness, perhaps? It looked like he&#39;d found the perfect entertainment for the rest of the day.

But despite the man&#39;s initial response, something gnawed at him still. A prickling sensation slowly crawling down his spine. It was peculiar, to say the least: had he become so allergic to receiving any form of acknowledgement that he couldn&#39;t even tolerate another person&#39;s simple expression of surprise?

No, that wasn&#39;t it. The source of his unease lay elsewhere. 

Lachlan returned his gaze to James&#39; bandaged hand. He ran his thumb across the fabric, exerting pressure onto the skin underneath as if attempting to assess the efficacy of his treatment. All the while, James remained passive, his hand limp in Lachlan&#39;s grasp and allowing him to maneuver it as he pleased. Such an obedient staff member he was...

&#39;...Aren&#39;t you going to take a look at what I&#39;ve done?&#39;

A slight chill crept up James&#39; arm as something cold pressed against the skin near his wrist. Lachlan had produced a shard of broken glass, carefully wedging it in the narrow gap between the bandages and skin. 

&#39;Well? Aren&#39;t you at all <em>curious</em> to what happened to that cut?&#39; The puppeteer prompted him, though there was a distinct edge to his voice now. &#39;Or are you waiting for me to perform the grand reveal?&#39;

James felt a sharp tug, as the brat began to exert force on the glass.

Was he figured out? Did he really just want to show off his work to James? How could he get out of this without being suspicious? What is his game plan if there are others in the suite with him? As the sweat built up and dropped once they became too heavy, his hands acted before his mind did.

<em>RIP</em>

The bandage tore due to the quick jerk back, causing the glass shard to cut into his hand a bit in the process, revealing the telltale signs of a very important fact; this man was a Master.

However, James wasn&#39;t satisfied with simply retreating. He came here with a mission in mind, after all.

Swinging up from below came a Silver Nail in the other hand of Lachlan&#39;s assaulter. The pointed tip gleamed in the light as the path it tore through intended to ram itself through the same hand that held the glass shard.

Even with his shades on, the glare showed no intentions to simply mug the kid. <em>This man was after his life</em>.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1111403952437743647 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1111403952437743647><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, May 25, 2023 4:22 PM">4:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His voice caught in his throat as he backed off, all telltale signs that there was more to this unassuming manservant than meets the eye. Something that had been hidden behind a carefully constructed fa&#231;ade, which fell away as the bandages unraveled, revealing a butterfly-shaped sigil in bright red strokes.

&#39;Command Seals,&#39; Lachlan scraped his chair back against the floor. &#39;You&#39;re—&#39;

—<em>a Master!</em> His free hand immediately reached for his side, only to realize with a jolt that he had left the seven shooter behind in his room. 

<em>clink!</em>

The surprise did not end there, however. Metal struck glass. The glass shard he had been holding was sent flying, while his palm seared with pain as James drove a long nail through the narrow gaps between his bones, entering from one side and emerging cleanly from the other. 

His body tensed up on pure flex. With a deep snarl, he clenched his hand around James&#39; before he could pull away, his own nails digging into the hand of the intruder and leaving behind several trails deep enough to draw blood. The initial shock had subsided, followed by a wave of frustration and self-reproach: how could he have let his guard down in his own sanctuary?! 

It was a foolish oversight, but not one without reason. After all, he had always relied on several safety measures to ensure his environment remained impervious to threats. Only that none of them were currently at his disposal.

—At least, not yet. Not unless he went to retrieve them himself!

Snatching an empty glass from the counter, the puppeteer smashed it towards James&#39; face. <strong>&#39;Who sent you?!&#39;</strong> He demanded as his mind ran through a list of potential suspects. The stubborn bitch in the sewers? But he didn&#39;t even recognize her. The news outlets should also be teeming with reports about the Wolf and the Dragon by now. He was practically invisible under the radar!

If momentum is kept, this should be an easy fight. That is what he thought, at least.

<em>slam</em>

If the pain caused by his fingernails digging into his hand wasn&#39;t enough. The next thing he knew was that he had an empty glass shatter against his head. A quick brace and turn of his head prevented any shards from entering his eyes but blood still flowed afterwards. 

&quot;<strong>AAARGH</strong>&quot; The sharp pain of feeling those glass shards embed themselves around the impact spot made James tumble back. The grip around his Silver Nail was lost and away it went with Lachlan as he ran. Most likely to try and get help or armed. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can guess who yourself!&quot; Could he? Not that James really cared, nor had an actual answer to his question either. 

After reaching behind him to equip himself with another one of his Silver Nails, with only two more in reserves on his person, James kept up the pursuit. Right now is the ideal situation to deal with the Dowling kid. No puppets or Servant to speak of. Odds are the security would be tightened to the point that another second would be impossible without facing against the kid&#39;s full might.

Whatever Lachlan was trying to reach meant trouble, regardless of what it could be. So, with a quick throw of his second Silver Nail, James aimed for his legs. Whether it missed or struck its target, James was more than ready to throw his weight at him in a tackle to keep him from escaping.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112187748049223711 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112187748049223711><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 27, 2023 8:17 PM">8:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>&#39;I&#39;m sure you can guess who yourself!&#39;</em> 

Lachlan wrenched open the door with renewed anger, imagining the handle cracking under his grip as James&#39; neck as he bit back a scathing retort. His patience for mind games had reached an all time low, especially when he found himself on the receiving end. With a forceful swing, he flung the door hard into the wall, eyes darting from side to side as he tried to recall where he had left his gun the previous night.

Fragmented memories resurfaced in flashes: the smell of smoke, the sensation of brain matter smearing his hands, the echoes of Pyg&#39;s groans as Bill stuffed its sorry ass into the storage unit...He was no longer wearing yesterday&#39;s outfit, so where had he...

Before he could gather his thoughts, James struck him with a second nail.

Lachlan staggered forward as fresh pain shot through his leg. Several inches above his knee, the needle pierced deep into his flesh, leaving behind nothing but the silver tip to indicate where it had struck. He crashed rather unforgivingly against the floorboard, nicking his shoulder on the bed&#39;s corner in the process and inadvertently dragging the bedsheets and pillows along.

James&#39; footsteps trailed closely behind. Without thinking, Lachlan threw the bedsheet toward the man like a fisherman casting a net, at the same time activating his magic circuits to run a single incantation through the fabric: <strong>Reinforcement</strong>. With any luck, that should buy him a precious few seconds to <em>think</em>, if he could goddamned remember where he&#39;d—

The Silver Nail struck true. While they did not possess incredible killing potential, apart from precise blows, their intention was to wear down the target through multiple wounds. Already James could almost feel his hand grasp around his target. A single blow to swiftly end the kid&#39;s life. This was the right course of action to take. It was James or him, after all. 

<em><strong>So, could he actually go through with it then?</strong></em>

Just as that thought attempted to cloud his judgement with doubts, a bedsheet clouded his vision first. 

The added reinforcement upon the bedsheet made it a difficult obstacle to get through with ease. It absolutely killed his momentum, forcing James to take a tumble onto the floor. Those unfortunate enough to get the floor below must be furious right about now. If they haven&#39;t placed a complaint by now, they most certainly did by now.

Frustrated, with one of the last two Silver Nails drawn in a reverse grip, James tossed the bedsheet aside. &quot;You&#39;re making this a lot harder than it needs to be, kid!&quot; Before James gave him more time to recover and regain his footing, he made his move and lunged towards Lachlan. His Silver Nail raised in the air as it pierced through the air towards the Dowling heir. 

Unless Lachlan preferred a third wound to match the other two, he needed to come up with something fast!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112486997525803080 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112486997525803080><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 28, 2023 4:06 PM">4:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And there it was—the familiar glint of metal, the toy he had rather smugly named <em>The Lachy Seven</em> on his seventeenth birthday. Over the years, the gun had undergone various modifications, but he always made sure it retained its seven-shot capacity. Sounded lucky, and perhaps brought him some fortune beyond its performance in battles as well. But no matter how extensively he customized it...

Bill&#39;s mocking jabs about his sloppy draw and careless handling of the firearm weighed on his mind. Even now, their truth was undeniable. The seven shooter was far from being a true weapon, let alone &#39;an extension of his arm&#39;, as the Archer so proudly boasted about his own guns. And as he fumbled to unlock the safety, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how much quicker he could have ended this meaningless fight if only he had kept it on his person at all times.

Had he grown complacent? Distracted? Was he running out of steam? Did he let his guard down because a part of him expected <em>someone</em>—his puppet, the Archer, or perhaps even useless Roland—to burst through the door and handle the situation for him? Had he forgotten the sensation of walking on hot coals, simply because he had been living a relatively comfortable life?

Had this new life made him soft?

To hell with that! He had always operated alone. The others were nothing more than pets tagging along. He&#39;d always been fine on his own! As James finally rid himself of the reinforced bedsheet and lunged at him, brandishing even more shiny metal between his fingers, Lachlan dragged the pillow across the floor and swung it upwards.

Lachlan followed up with a kick from his leg, but James had already closed the distance, and his knee collided with the man&#39;s ribs, barely halting his advance.

He couldn&#39;t throw James off, however. Though he had gotten plenty of practice tussling with his twin, the muscle memory had long faded, and James was even taller than him and more thickly built. Gravity worked against him and his leg, strained as it was, trembled with pain from the puncture wounds and offered little in the way of resistance. 

The Silver Nails swung down toward him; with a grunt of effort he managed to position the pillow in their path, the sharp tips sinking into the soft down and turning it into a giant pincushion. Lachlan instinctively used his elbow to support the pillow, ensuring that it remained a barrier between the needles and his face and keeping the dangerous metals at bay. 

&#39;Maybe <em>you</em> picked the wrong &quot;kid&quot; to mess with, ever thought about that?!&#39; He spat, imagining James&#39; face contorting behind the pillow. &#39;In case you&#39;re blind in both eyes, allow me to remind you that I am a grown-up. Being difficult is my <em>privilege</em>!&#39;

One shot. One shot to end this farce. With a trembling hand he pressed his gun into the pillow. Estimated the location of James&#39; neck, face, eyes. Hooked his finger on the trigger despite the stinging protest in the center of his palm, and fired.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112516026953908306 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112516026953908306><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 28, 2023 6:01 PM">6:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite the impact having lost most of the strength behind it, the knee to his ribs still stole some of the breath from his lungs. The pain was much more potent as well given the wounds he sustained against his fight with Ann. This helped to rob more strength from behind the strike.

The Silver Nail pierced into the soft pillow and denied to go any further thanks to Lachlan&#39;s arm propping up the pillow. Though, with his strength pressing down upon the pillow, this stab will only be agonizingly slow instead. To make matters worse, the needle appeared to be slowly burning the pillow around it. Since when did he attack with a hot metal poker instead!

&quot;I have been called old myself by people older than you! So, to me, you are just a ki-&quot;

<strong>BANG</strong>

The loud pop from Lachy Seven rang through the room as James fell back with a hard thud.

Did he do it? Was his aim true? No movements or sounds came from James. Perhaps the shot was all he needed.

&quot;Aaargh...&quot; A weak groan came from the supposedly dead would-be assassin. The bullet grazed the side of his head, scoring his face with a grievous wound despite the graze. The shot broke his shades, leaving them without an arm, or lens, to speak of as they hung onto his face weakly with the remaining arm. The blood that flowed from the wound forced James to keep his right eye closed, at least until the flow was stemmed. The other eye, though, with its vibrant and nebulous gaze, stared straight at Lachlan...</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, May 29, 2023 3:07 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1112529152780800090 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1112529152780800090><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, May 28, 2023 6:53 PM">6:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The close proximity of the gunshot pounded his eardrums, but that was only the least of his worries. The pillow had begun to <em>smoke</em>; the odor of burning hair and synthetics made his eyes water. He started to push the pillow away, and it gave surprisingly easily as James fell back against the wall. 

But, perhaps he shouldn&#39;t have been so surprised. After all, he had fired the gun at such close range. It was almost inevitable that it would hit his mark.

Lachlan kicked James&#39; hand away, along with the smoldering pillow, as far away from him as possible. He struggled to his feet, faltered, and cursed at the burning pain in his thigh. Every motion felt like torture. He really should extract the Nail before the injury exacerbated any further. His medkit—

The man began to stir. Lachlan snapped his attention back, turning his head so fast he thought he&#39;d pulled a muscle. Despite the copious amounts of blood running down James&#39; face, the rise and fall of his chest indicated consciousness. The sunglasses had shattered, but was that the extent of the damage? Had he missed, at point-blank range?

Lachlan swore and could barely hear himself swearing. The ringing in his ears gradually dimmed, and only then did he make out the weak groans coming from his assailant.

&#39;Give it up, <em>old man</em>!&#39; He knelt in front of James, jaws clenched, fingers deftly rotating the cylinder to align the next shot. He ripped away the remnants of the sunglasses off James&#39; face, and leveled the revolver with his forehead.

For a moment, it didn&#39;t seem all too bad of a deal. One to cancel her Noble Phantasm and the another for her life. The hand that reached out for him to give up was so close. So tempting...

<em>However, since when did he ever choose the easy way out?</em>

&quot;I can&#39;t do that to her...&quot; Another shot was needed to put this man down it seemed. His sights slowly drifted upwards and away from his Command Spells. &quot;If you&#39;re so grown-up, then make sure you look into the eyes of the person before you shoot them.&quot; Then James locked eyes with Lachlan as he knelt down in front of him. His unique eyes, well, eye in this case, could be spotted by a mile away; they were <em>Mystic Eyes</em>.

In the same moment of realization came the tearing of the world around them. The pieces of shredded reality flew up into the air like ashes to the wind. Voices of Lachlan&#39;s past creeped around him. Scenes of his time in Berenice raced passed him. It was like his whole life was being unraveled. Like an open book for everyone to see. Except there was only one other person here to see it all. One man who simply sat in front him. Well, James <em>was</em> in front of him. Before he escaped into the void while the world was unveiling itself, he shot a weak smile at his opponent. That look said it all; &#39;<em>Still just a kid</em>&#39;

That stubborn old bastard...

The voices grew louder and the scenes grew more vivid until a scene from his past was being built around him. Piece by piece.

<strong>James blinks, as his mind grasps the sudden change in his own surroundings. He finds himself seated at the back of a bus, the warm touch of sunlight running streaks across his legs.</strong> The bus rumbles along a dirt road, accompanied by the faint tremor of its roaring engine and a half-broken radio playing static-filled music right next to the driver&#39;s seat.

A gentle breeze passes through the open windows, bringing with it the scent of early summer. In the row of seats ahead, two identical-looking boys with bright red hair converse animatedly, their hushed tones barely concealing their excitement as they pour over a brand new map.

&#39;Can you believe it, Griff? We&#39;re finally on our way.&#39; Says one kid.

The other kid laughs nervously. &#39;I know, Lachy, but what if they find us? What if they catch us? The teachers won&#39;t be happy, you know.&#39;

&#39;Oh, who cares?&#39; Lachy waves his hand dismissively, like a grown-up. &#39;We&#39;ve planned this carefully. They won&#39;t have a clue where we&#39;ve gone.&#39;

&#39;But what about mom and dad? Won&#39;t they be worried?&#39;

&#39;Griff,&#39; Lachlan places his hand on Griffin&#39;s forehead, feigning a serious tone. &#39;Are you feeling okay? Did you forget why we&#39;re running away in the first place?&#39; He grips his twin&#39;s hands tightly.

Griffin thinks for a moment. &#39;To get away from dad,&#39; he responds, quietly.

&#39;Uh-huh.&#39; Lachlan nods.

&#39;And...to prove them wrong.&#39; Griffin adds, then lowers his gaze to stare at the map.

&#39;Yep!&#39; Lachlan encourages him. &#39;Because we&#39;ve had it up to <em>here</em> with them!&#39; He raises his hand above his head dramatically.

Griffin can&#39;t help but join in, mimicking his twin&#39;s gesture. &#39;Yeah, because...because we&#39;ve had it up to here with them!&#39; 

The two kids look at each other, and suddenly they both giggle because it&#39;s funny to hear the same words coming out of both their mouths.

&#39;What does that mean, father?&#39;

<strong>James leans back against the arm of an expensive-looking sofa. The boys stand upright in front of him, hands neatly tucked behind their backs.</strong> Lachlan exchanges a look with Griffin. They both turn their eyes back to their father, who sits across the desk in his study and observes them both with a cold and unfeeling gaze. A cascade of red mane frames his face, accentuating the scars that mar his otherwise handsome features and giving him a perpetually stern expression. He inhales, and his chest rises and falls heavily.

The boys involuntarily tense up.

&#39;It means, Lachlan, that I have decided to pass onto <em>you</em> the inheritance of the Dowling Magic Crest, as well as the family business.&#39; The man explains stoically. &#39;Your talent in puppetry is exceptional, and your academic achievements leave nothing to be desired. You have proven yourself worthy of carrying on the family legacy.&#39;

Lachlan lets out a slow exhale, relieved. &#39;Thank you, father. I&#39;ve been working hard to make you proud.&#39;

Griffin shifts in his chair. &#39;But, dad, what about me? Am I not good enough?&#39;

The man&#39;s gaze drifts past Griffin, as if he were nothing more than a mere afterthought.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">***</code>

&#39;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re getting everything, Lachy! It&#39;s not fair!&#39;

Griffin storms up the stairs to their shared bedroom, and Lachlan quickens his pace to catch up. Griffin slams the door shut in front of his twin&#39;s face, leaving him on the other side. Then he flings himself down onto his bed.

&#39;Not fair!&#39; He pouts into his pillow.

&#39;Hey, it&#39;s not like I asked for this!&#39; Lachlan opens the door and slides into the room. &#39;Father thinks I&#39;m better suited, that&#39;s all.&#39;

&#39;Better suited?&#39; Griffin rounds on his twin, frustration and jealousy boiling over. &#39;Are you joking? We have the same grades. We control the same number of puppets. I&#39;ve worked just as hard as you. What can you do that I can&#39;t?&#39;

&#39;Benefit the family? Or benefit <em>you</em>? You&#39;ve always been the golden child in dad&#39;s eyes!&#39;

&#39;That&#39;s not true,&#39; Lachlan frowns at Griffin&#39;s accusation. &#39;I never wanted our family to come between us.&#39;

&#39;Well, good for you then,&#39; Griffin huffs. &#39;You&#39;ve succeeded in making me feel like a nobody.&#39;

Lachlan lets out a sigh. &#39;C&#39;mon, Griff, try to understand. I didn&#39;t ask for this, okay? I can&#39;t change father&#39;s decision. We&#39;ve always been there for each other, and I don&#39;t want that to change.&#39; When Griffin doesn&#39;t make any sign that he has been heard, Lachlan shakes his head and walks over to his twin&#39;s bed. &#39;Okay, fine, what can I do to make it up to you?&#39;

&#39;Too late.&#39; Griffin grumbles. &#39;It&#39;s like you said, there&#39;s nothing we can do. Dad only has eyes for you. The family always comes first.&#39;

&#39;Well, <em>you</em> are more important to me than &quot;the family&quot;. You <em>are</em> family.&#39; Lachlan kneels beside Griffin&#39;s bed.

Griffin&#39;s expression softens slightly. &#39;That doesn&#39;t change a thing though.&#39;

&#39;You&#39;re right, it doesn&#39;t.&#39; Lachlan replies, his own expression thoughtful. &#39;But we can still make our own mark, Griff. In fact, why don&#39;t we teach father a &quot;lesson&quot;?

<strong>The scene transitions once again, leaving behind the opulent study of the Dowling mansion and dropping James in the middle of a dense forest, where a small form writhes on the ground several feet away.</strong>

&#39;Urghhhh....&#39;

Lachlan hugs the soil and grass beneath him, feeling the dampness soak into his skin. Blood fills his throat, making it difficult to breathe. He coughs and gasps for air, crawls onto his stomach, his body trembling uncontrollably. Pain radiates through his torso as blood pours out of the multitude of gashes all over his body. His spine twists cruelly, sending spasms through his limbs as he desperately clings onto life.

The slender humanoid puppet looms over him. Its arm rises, and its claws descend upon its master, again, and again, and—

&#39;THAT&#39;S ENOUGH!&#39;

A voice cuts through the forest. His voice. Someone sharing his voice yells over his head, and his puppet—the Dancer—stops in its tracks. Lachlan lifts his eyelids and sees the pale silhouette of his twin peering down at him.

&#39;Griffin...&#39; He extends a bloodied hand towards his twin. &#39;Griffin...help...&#39;

Griffin perches on a fallen tree trunk. He watches Lachlan coldly. &#39;You should have been more careful, Lachy. We&#39;ve always been warned not to mess up with our family&#39;s puppets. The Dancer is <em>your</em> creation, right? You should&#39;ve trained it better.&#39;

Confusion swirls in Lachlan&#39;s mind, but the pain...it&#39;s overwhelming...

&#39;Anyway, why should I help you?&#39; Griffin crosses his arms. &#39;You&#39;ve always been the brave one. And now look at you. Your own puppet went crazy!&#39;

No, something isn&#39;t right. Lachlan shakes his head weakly. There&#39;s no way the Dancer could have gone berserk on its own. He musters the last reserves of his strength, pumping what little mana he has left into his veins as the warmth of his own Healing Magecraft depleted. &#39;Come on, Griff. Not a lecture, not now...&#39;

<strong>James finds himself engulfed in total darkness. Faint murmurs press in on him from above, their origins mysterious and elusive. Where is he now?...</strong>

<em>&#39;The lacerations on his body are extensive,&#39;</em> says a voice.

<em>&#39;Yes. It appears to be a complex case,&#39;</em> replies another voice. <em>&#39;We&#39;ll need to repair all the damaged tissues to minimize the risk of complications.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;His vitals are stable, but his body is showing signs of reacting to the anesthesia. Keep an eye on that.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;Understood. We&#39;ll adjust the dosage accordingly.&#39;</em>

<em>Who are these people? What are they talking about?</em> 

Lachlan&#39;s voice echoes out of nowhere, and James realizes that he had landed somewhere in the kid&#39;s subconsciousness. Even in the depths of his slumber, his mind stirs restlessly. The voices blend into a distant chorus of medical terminology and instructions...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116615155116150805 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116615155116150805><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:29 AM">1:29 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t one to talk, though. If anything, he fitted right in with the rest of them. That fact earned a scoff from the man. It was aimed either at that fact or the fact that he was calling the kettle black. 

The time for internal thoughts came to an end, however. James wasn&#39;t the only person inside of this world. Before he dug deeper into Lachlan&#39;s memories, he wanted to see how he was handling this little trip down memory lane.

&quot;How does it feel, kid?&quot; Inside of a black void, James spoke to the other passenger in this trip. The faint sounds of memories crept around them, almost as if they were threatening to become more than simple background noise. All James needed to do was select one and Lachlan got to relive any memory James could find. Absolutely zero privacy or consideration was had for such personal memories.

James kept himself by using the trails of memories as cover. 

It wouldn&#39;t be far off to say that James was scared of retaliation. The kid came from a prestigious magi family, after all. A gun wouldn&#39;t be the only thing in his arsenal Best to play it safe.

&quot;Watching your life from the sidelines made me curious. Because we all have stuff in our lives that we <strong>never</strong> forget. Events in our lives make us who we are as people. Some people find the resolve to keep going forever. Others put up fronts to mask the pain they endured. But you? I think there&#39;s something in here that even <strong>you</strong> are keeping from yourself.&quot;

Lectures from an old man. Did this man think him as his father?

In the midst of this void, detached from reality, a younger version of himself stood at the center of this world. The kid was looking away, with his back turned to Lachlan, and gazing into the distance as if longing for something far beyond his reach.

<em>No,</em> Lachlan thought. <em>Don&#39;t look. Whatever is out there...</em>

He rushed towards his younger self, as quickly as his legs could carry him, arms outstretched to shield the kid&#39;s eyes from the unknown. But then...

His younger self turned around, his face blank, lost...ugly scars running down raw skin that had been marred by the world&#39;s cruelty...and then the silhouette began to shift...morphing into a middle-aged man with unkempt dark hair and weariness etched across his face.

Lachlan froze in shock. He took a step back, but then a surge of anger welled up within him. He advanced towards the man once more...

<strong>&#39;Having <em>fun</em>, are we?!&#39;</strong>

His hand was no longer injured; his leg no longer felt pain. It was as if he had been miraculously healed from the injuries James had inflicted upon him—but perhaps that wasn&#39;t exactly right. No, this was a game that <em>he</em> knew all too well: after all, Mental Interference Magecraft was supposed to be <em>his</em> forte. Whatever this space was, it existed beyond reality, untouched by anything but the deepest recesses of his mind. It was a dark place that should have remained locked away, yet now he found himself all the way back here, accompanied by a most unwelcomed intruder.

<em>How dare he open his mouth...how dare he judge him...he had no right...</em>

&#39;I should have gouged those eyes out when I had the chance! Would have fetched a high price!&#39; He caught up to James and seized him by the collar. &#39;How much...*how much did you <strong>SEE?!&#39;*</strong>

The marks of glass embedded into his head were also gone. Not only did this man just reset the playing field between them, he now held domain over this world as well as anything and everything that may rest inside of his mind. And all it took was the simple mistake of looking into his eyes in that single moment.

As if to goad Lachlan further, James did not move back or leave his reach once his collar was held. He just stared down at him with his stoic expression unmoving. 

&quot;...You and your brother seemed close. <strong>Shame about the accident</strong>.&quot; So <em>that</em> is how far he was able to dig back to. A glimpse at his other half, for lack of a better term.

&quot;Is that why you seek the grail? To get him back, perhaps?&quot; More and more James continued to dig deeper into Lachlan to see where those cracks were. Was his resolve strong enough to make it out of this alive? The shaking was a poor sign of his ability to be able to, unfortunately.

&quot;Or to please your Father? Maybe it is to get back at him for <em>how</em> he treated your brother?&quot; James did his best to maintain his footing while he was shaken around by him. Nothing was sacred to Lachlan anymore. If James wanted to know, all he needed to do was to look and that was it. There was nothing that could stop him.

To make matters worse, James could make him relive them rather than merely remember them.

&quot;We all have our trauma, kid. <em><strong>How about we see yours?</strong></em>&quot; A hand was grasped onto Lachlan&#39;s collar, as if to hammer in the feeling that he can&#39;t run away, while the flow of memories around them quickened. 

Soon the world around them was taking shape. Whatever James wanted to make him see, it would appear that he found it.

But just what was it?...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116616465060208720 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116616465060208720><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:35 AM">1:35 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His mind was aware of the antics James had been pulling: the logical part of his brain, picking apart James&#39; jabs and taunts, recognizing them as carefully crafted words designed to elicit a reaction. It urged him to ignore them, to maintain his composure, knowing all too well that this was precisely how James gained power over him...

Yet he had far more personal reasons to ignore those warnings. James had violated his privacy, and that was unforgivable.

&#39;To hell with the Grail,&#39; his grip tightened so painfully that his knuckles turned white. &#39;Even if I have no use for it, I would never concede it to the likes of you!&#39;

He didn&#39;t even care that James towered over him, a full head taller. Didn&#39;t care that when James finally retaliated, he was easily pushed back, his own collar hoisted by a firm grip that nailed him in place. Even though part of him feared what James had been able to dig up with his Mystic Eyes—but then again, <em>so what?</em> 

For all he knew, verbal threats seemed to be the extent of James&#39; buffoonery. If those Eyes possessed greater power, then surely James would have used it already!

A bark of laughter escaped the puppeteer&#39;s lips. &#39;You&#39;re on a fool&#39;s errand,&#39; he sneered with newfound assurance. &#39;My brother, my father—there&#39;s nothing for you to exploit. What&#39;s done is done! No matter how far you dig, they won&#39;t overshadow the fact that once I break out of here, you&#39;re gonna wish you were dead.&#39;

He had meant it, every single word he had uttered. For each memory James had glimpsed without permission, he would pay him back tenfold—

Which was why he blanched as a new surge of memories came rushing in. No longer flowing passively by, they now threatened to engulf him as well, drowning him in their torrent...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>You find yourself wrapped in darkness, a space devoid of light or form...</strong>

Then there is a voice, cold and hard, yet painfully familiar, <em>&#39;We have waited long enough. It&#39;s time we reconsider our options.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;But is it really necessary?&#39;</em> A woman&#39;s voice follows. <em>&#39;Lachlan is our heir. You&#39;ve already started the Crest transplantation process with him.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;It&#39;s not a problem,&#39;</em> the man replies. <em>&#39;The procedure is still in its early stages. We can easily remove the Crest from him and give it to Griffin.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;But the backlash...&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;They won&#39;t affect Griffin. We made a mistake in our decision. Lachlan lacks the qualities needed to lead this family if he can&#39;t even tame the Dancer. Meanwhile, Griffin&#39;s performance has been consistent. With proper education, he will acquire the skills necessary to continue my legacy.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;What about the branch family?&#39;</em> The woman replies, concerned. <em>&#39;We&#39;ve already arranged the transfer. If we ask for Griffin back now, your brother won&#39;t be happy.&#39;</em>

The man chuckles. <em>&#39;You brought me a set of twins,&#39;</em> he tells the woman. <em>&#39;It&#39;s a simple fix.&#39;</em>

Silence stretches between them. Then the woman speaks, <em>&#39;You don&#39;t mean...?&#39;</em>

The man walks over to his firstborn son and caresses his face. <em>&#39;Their age. Their appearance. The shape of their faces. Their mannerisms. Even the quality of their Circuits. They resemble each other so closely. Of course we can swap them.&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;And nobody will notice?&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;Come on, Lorelle,&#39;</em> says the man. <em>&#39;You are their mother. Haven&#39;t you noticed how often Griffin has acted out all these years, throwing his little kid tantrums and claiming to be his brother? This&#39;ll suit him just fine. It won&#39;t make a significant difference in the long run, either. We&#39;ll swap their identities while Lachlan remains in a coma, and no one will suspect a thing.&#39;</em>

&#39;Griffin James Dowling?&#39;

The classroom goes dead quiet. No one says a thing. Then everybody looks around. The teacher taps his pen on the attendance sheet. He looks up, and scans the room with a frown.

&#39;Griffin James Dowling?&#39; He calls out one more time, his voice a touch more impatient.

You see movement beside you before the words reach your ears. A boy with bleached blonde hair leans towards you, and declares loudly and clearly, &#39;He&#39;s here, Mister!&#39; He points directly at you. The other children seize the opportunity to chime in eagerly. &#39;He&#39;s right here! Look!&#39;

The teacher&#39;s gaze falls on you, heavy with disproval, &#39;Third time this week,&#39; he purses his lips, then marks Griffin&#39;s name on the attendance sheet.

Then it&#39;s Lachlan&#39;s turn on the list, and suddenly, panic jolts through your body. You lurch to raise your hand up to signify your presence one more time, but the blonde boy intercepts, gripping your hand firmly under the table so you have to watch while Griffin nods and takes your name with a proud little smile.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116616923141111898 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116616923141111898><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:37 AM">1:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><h1>???? ????</h1>

<strong>You are back in that dreaded room.</strong>

You lay sobbing into the floor, sprawled out on all fours with a bruised head. You try to roll over. Your own puppet steps on your shoulder and pins you flat against the ground, its command overridden from your own. As you try to regain control of the puppet with your mind, fear washes over you—fear of getting crushed, fear of being trapped, fear of getting punished for losing control of your puppet once again, because this never happens before, <em>never</em>, not since...

&#39;No...&#39; 

You cry out. <em>Let me out,</em> you repeat over and over in your head. <em>No more of this, let it end, don&#39;t—</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The rugged voice of James pierced through as he made himself known. Right besides Lachlan was his opponent kneeling down, head tilted a bit to side to better align with him while he was on the ground.

There was no pain on his face. No inkling of smugness. Nor any hint of joy. The only hint of anything was <em>pity</em>. This man pitied him.

&quot;No.&quot; A gentle shake of his head was made. &quot;He took more than just your name, didn&#39;t he?&quot;

&quot;He took everything from you. You were left as the reject by the end of it. The failure that could&#39;ve been. Tsk. Tsk.&quot; Like a disapproving father, James shook his head again. This time it was done as if he was disappointed by the end result.

&quot;Although.&quot; While he was still pinned upon the ground, a hand was felt on his back to soon expose his Magic Crest that laid on his back by lifting up his shirt. &quot;This doesn&#39;t look incomplete at all. I was around your age when I was still in the Clock Tower but even I, after all these years, can see how much of a shoddy job this was.&quot;

&quot;This could mean a few things. One, you stole what you felt like was yours. Two, something happened to Griffin that could have been out of your hands, of course. Or three, they felt pity for you.&quot;

All of them were focused on him intentionally, of course. An attempt to pry into Lachlan by suggesting he got the Magic Crest out of charity opposed to earning it.

&quot;<strong>I wonder which one it is. Let&#39;s find out, shall we?</strong>&quot; No breaks would be afforded to him as the world torn itself apart just to reform into a new memory entirely. No breaks until <em>everything</em> was seen. No matter what kind of mental barriers his mind may have put up to protect himself from the certain memories, James could simply drag him along into making repressed memories fresh once more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116617412054368286 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116617412054368286><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:38 AM">1:38 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Then shook his head. He curled into himself and sobbed incoherently. When James laid a hand on his head and shook it, he let him. The gesture was but a meager offering of comfort compared to the crushing weight of the puppet pinning him to the ground, but Lachlan clung to this touch, desperate for any solace amidst the torment he had been forced to relive.

&#39;I didn&#39;t know...&#39; He whimpered. &#39;Father didn&#39;t...he wouldn&#39;t...&#39;

Yet, if he truly had no knowledge of this memory, then how could it be a part of him that James had unearthed? The puppeteer began to despair. The mere possibility that these forgotten fragments were within him was enough to drive him insane. He dared not entertain such thoughts, choosing instead to focus on the man before him, who chided him with words both gentle and cruel.

<em>Anything...anything to divert his mind from the possibility that he had been discarded as a failed specimen...</em>

He nodded fervently as James exposed the Magic Crest on his back. He was willing to admit to anything. <em>God, just don&#39;t make him think about anything anymore.</em>

&#39;I did it,&#39; he confessed, remembering the night almost two years ago and a group of people, gathered around a corpse that had been beaten beyond recognition. &#39;I had someone do it...stripped it from...from him...&#39;

The imagery warped again, then became even more vivid. He could almost smell the scent of disinfectant, feel the touch of clotted blood on the tips of his fingers, and see his own terrified face trembling before his eyes. The scene expanded before him, and only then did he realize—

<strong>&#39;No! No, don&#39;t take me there, I don&#39;t want to—&#39;</strong> 

But his plea was cut short. The next moment, the room began to melt away.

<strong>&#39;YOU BASTARD!&#39;</strong> He screamed at James. <strong>&#39;YOU DESPICABLE, ROTTEN PIECE OF—&#39;</strong>

James plunged him back under.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The surgeon discarded his tools onto a nearby plate. He stepped back from the operating table, then removed his mask and revealed a rather blinding smile. &#39;The procedure is complete,&#39; he announced cheerfully. &#39;The transplantation was a success. Congratulations, my young friend, you&#39;ve managed to make it through.&#39;

He rummaged through a cabinet and dropped a bottle of pills next to the kid. &#39;Take two of these every four hours. Although, given your circumstances, I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll even have a noticeable effect. But hey,&#39; he shrugged. &#39;Just doing my job here, you know? Covering all the bases.&#39;

As the nurses began to loosen the bindings that held Lachlan in place, the surgeon continued with the care instructions, emphasizing the need for rest. Eventually, a nurse nudged him in the back and gestured towards the operating table.

&#39;Oh, goodness me,&#39; he chuckled, scratching his head. &#39;I&#39;ve managed to lull you to sleep! Well, no need to worry. It&#39;s not like I have another patient begging for my services tonight.&#39; With a flourish, he reached for the light switch. &#39;I suppose I can let you snooze until the morning.&#39;

And the light went off.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Out of all of the seats, he chose this one so he was just within Lachlan&#39;s sightlines. A constant reminder that he is watching and observing <em>everything</em>. 

Soon the operation was over. The &#39;doctor&#39; departed along with the nurses. It was just those two alone together again. 

James saw his moment. The steps of the man got closer as he entered the operating room. Though the light was off, a dim spotlight shined on Lachlan. The light it provided seemed to almost place the room in just another one of the voids in between memories. The walls were gone. Just a small circular area remained. 

&quot;It&#39;s time for you to sleep, kid. Just close your eyes and it will all be over.&quot; The sounds of a scalpel being picked up from one of the plates left behind was all too audible in this loud silence.

&quot;No more pain. No more trauma. I promise.&quot; The steps made their way closer and closer to where Lachlan laid down. 

&quot;<strong>Sweet dreams, kid.</strong>&quot; Once James got close enough, James brought his arm up then back down with the scalpel being held in a reverse grip to plunge into the back of his neck. A swift and painless death.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116618055863246859 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116618055863246859><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:41 AM">1:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Yes,</em> he thought. <em>Just let it go, and then it&#39;s all over. No more pain. No more suffering. <strong>No more pretending to be the person he used to be, the person he no longer is, and the person he&#39;ll never become.*</strong> 

He was so tired. He had done so many things, had so many things done *to</em> him, to reach this point. Yet his world still remained so broken. He thought he had been fixing it, turning it into something better, but in the end his efforts amounted to nothing.

Absolutely nothing. His own puppet had run amok. His Servant had deserted him. His father still refused to look him in the eye. Perhaps it would be better—easier, simpler—to let it all go. And right here stood a man who could bring it all to an end.

He let go of the bottle of pills. <em>Yes. Sweet dreams.</em> Those words lingered in his mind as James raised a shiny scalpel. 

<em>I&#39;m ready,</em> he thought to himself. <em>I&#39;m ready for this.</em>

Yet as he prepared to lay down his life, he felt a flicker of uncertainty, like he&#39;d tasted something unpleasant. He was ready to die, was he not? In this world, a mindscape handpicked by his enemy...

The world came to a sudden halt.

<strong>&#39;No.&#39;</strong>

The scalpel met Lachlan&#39;s nape, only to bend, distort, as if it had been made of liquid, before dissolving into nothingness. 

&#39;No,&#39; Lachlan said again, his voice more resolute, his eyes bright with sudden relief. &#39;If I&#39;m going to die, then I get a choice. I&#39;ll face death in a memory of my own choosing. It only seems right.&#39;

Space expanded rapidly around them. Then everything changed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Now we&#39;re talking.&#39;

Lachlan propped himself up against a corner of the room. He was shaking like a leaf, his body still bearing the remnants of grime from the operating room. However, everything else in the space had undergone a full transformation.

&#39;Welcome to my deathbed,&#39; the puppeteer remarked. &#39;This is where I was made; naturally, this is where I shall meet my end.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116618216358281236 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116618216358281236><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:42 AM">1:42 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The new location plus the sudden surprise from beneath him was more than what was needed to cause the man to stumble backwards. 

Where was he? He didn&#39;t choose this memory to form. Fear crept into him as his breathing became unsteady.

An erratic exhale was made in an attempt to calm his nerves. Losing control now was the last thing James could afford to do right now. The man merely wanted a change of scenery before his end. Fair enough. No issues there.

&quot;A fitting place, no? Given everything you went through.&quot; Operating room or Training room. It made no difference to him. Lachlan was still affected by the operation. The odds were still tilted in his favour.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid, without that scalpel, this won&#39;t go as smoothly as it could&#39;ve been.&quot; He spoke while he stomped towards him. What will it be? Death through stomps? Choking? Or simple brutal beatings? The answer will be clear soon.

Shame.

&#39;Don&#39;t be so na&#239;ve!&#39; Lachlan retorted. &#39;How come you&#39;ve witnessed so much, but understood so little? Year after year I&#39;ve spent my time here, tangoing with death, taming one monster after another...if I were to die in this place, it wouldn&#39;t be a force beyond my control, but rather a consequence of my own actions.&#39;

Lachlan&#39;s voice reverberated deep within James&#39; cranium. He hadn&#39;t shouted, nor was this anything akin to a telepathic connection. Each uttered syllable simply infiltrated James&#39; thoughts, and threatened to stir up dormant emotions. 

&#39;The shock from seeing your Mystic Eyes caught me off guard. But this,&#39; the puppeteer gestured to the space around them, &#39;This is all a projection of our consciousness, isn&#39;t it? Your Mystic Eyes possess the power of unconditional hypnotism,&#39; he theorized. &#39;If so, then that clears up a few things.&#39;

A haze enveloped James&#39; mind. Amidst his own thoughts, another stream of consciousness ran parallel, seemingly wanting to merge with his own. 

Without lifting a finger, Lachlan had initiated his assault.

&#39;We Mental Interference Magecraft users are strongest when we&#39;re in our element.&#39; He explained. &#39;In other words, we need an anchor to keep our own beliefs grounded. This room is where I learned to <strong>handle my fears</strong>...I wonder how well I&#39;ll fare against you?&#39;

Just then, an idea leapt into James&#39; mind.

His hands held tight either side of his head.

Damnit! He was so close! A single moment longer and he had him in that operating room! <em>He thought he was broken!</em>

To make matters worse, now he had to deal with what he feared most; Mental Interference.

The look of scorn James shot at Lachlan as he attempted to recover, unsuccessfully so, from his assault told him everything he theorized was true, even if James refused to admit it. 

&quot;You little brat...&quot; Spoken through gritted teeth came his retort. Like a dog at the end of his leash, James did his best to stand on weak legs. &quot;What does a reject like yourself even have to fight for?!&quot; Venom was spat out at him after failing to take even a single step forward from where he bent the knee.

Every second passed meant less control James had over his own world. Doubts flooded his mind of whether he could still cancel out the connection or not. Enough of a hold effectively meant the door was locked for James.

&#39;<em><strong>TELL ME</strong></em>&#39;

Another strained groan came from James as his other knee fell to match the other. &#39;No! Nonono! Stay out!&#39; James screamed back at the very same thoughts that invaded his mind.

&quot;<em><strong>I SAID OUT!!!</strong></em>&quot;

But his pleas were ignored...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Are you even listening to me, James?&quot; A woman&#39;s voice spoke up, snapping James back to attention to take in his new surroundings.

It took him aback enough to pinch his throat slightly. That is when he noticed his hand. He was wearing black gloves along with a sleek black suit, opposed to the outfit he was wearing moments ago.

One glance in the mirror and he knew why; he was young again, before his Mystic Eyes manifested.

&quot;I know what your father said about your performance here is bothering you. You have to remember that he was more than likely going to say the same thing regardless of what you have done.&quot; Again the woman spoke just beyond the door to James. How long has it been since he heard his voice again? Any answer would be too long.

Tears built up in the corner of his eyes as he reached out towards her before rage soon replaced whatever sadness were there was instead.

&quot;Where are you, you little brat?! I know you&#39;re here somewhere!&quot; James used his young vocals to their fullest and lashed out at whatever was inside the public restroom. Doors to stalls were kicked in. Mirrors were smashed. But nothing. All he accomplished was running himself out of breath.

&quot;Yes, yes, I know.&quot; The inflections in her voices told of her eyes rolling as the scene continued without James acting his part. &quot;&#39;I must uphold the Rellum Family name. It is my duty as heir!&#39; God, you are sounding like such a broken record at this point!&quot; She ended it with a playful laugh after mocking his tone. Despite being his bodyguard, Ava still held a charm to her that James couldn&#39;t help but feel sharp pains in his heart from hearing again.

&quot;You have to be nearby, kid...<strong>Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know how all of this works!</strong>&quot; Despite many frustrated attempts to change the surroundings, it all remained the same. <em>He was stuck</em>.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116619548863500339 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116619548863500339><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:47 AM">1:47 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Someone moved up to the sink next to James, the sound of water flowing as they turned on the tap. James turned around apprehensively...

Oh, it was just another fellow student from the Tower.

&#39;Right here, idiot.&#39; 

Lachlan leaned against the far wall, holding a stack of what appeared to be newspapers in his hand. His appearance had changed, resembling more of his present-day self. Red shirt, dark vest, and soft hair that fell around his eyes in slight curls, complimenting the color of his shirt. The only difference between him and the kid James had encountered in the hotel room was the multitude of scars marring his face.

Lachlan flipped through the papers.

&#39;<em>Yorkshire Ripper Continues Reign of Terror, Eludes Authorities Once More</em>. Classy,&#39; he remarked, rapping his knuckle against the headline. &#39;What is it with England and its obsession with killing <em>women</em>? I suppose my ancestors made a wise choice in moving away.&#39;

He laughed, but his eyes never left James, alerted to his every move. Slowly, he folded up the newspaper, and stuffed it down the drain.

&#39;Not like you have the right to judge, of course.&#39; He continued with a smirk. &#39;James Rellum, the poster child of the Rellum family...and murderer of a woman named Ava Tisdale.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116619680430432267 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116619680430432267><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:47 AM">1:47 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The man he allowed himself to lose himself, the tighter the hold this kid held on him.

<em>‘Right here, idiot.’</em>

The attempt to calm himself went straight down the drain the moment he saw him. Lachlan&#39;s smug face served to only stoke the flames even further. When he gets his hands on this kid...

&quot;Now wash up, will you? I&#39;m sure the &#39;supervised trip&#39; to the city we planned after school will cheer you up!&quot; As if to make matters worse for him, there was no end to the reminders of his wife in his ear.

&#39;Hold your ground... Don&#39;t allow him to goad you...&#39; More mantras were repeated to himself in his head as he struggled with the pain of hearing his wife&#39;s voice. His unsteady breathing needed to go first. If the kid wants a tug-o-war between both minds then he will ge-

Except Lachlan had to mention his wife. Not only that but to insinuate that his actions led to the loss of his wife further down the line, a fear that kept itself resided within the darker parts of his mind, went beyond mere goading.

&quot;<strong>YOU KEEP HER NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, YOU BASTARD!</strong>&quot; James erupted as one could almost hear him snapping on the place. His eyes were screaming bloody murder at him. Someone wasn&#39;t as in check with their emotions as their older self was it would seem.

So it would come to no surprise that James broke into a sprint towards him shortly after with his fist reeled back. While his control over his emotions wasn&#39;t as refined, James did feel the energy of youth back inside of him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116619931048497162 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116619931048497162><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:48 AM">1:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Did I strike a nerve?&#39; Lachlan&#39;s cat-like grin widened as he noticed veins bulging in James&#39; neck. Quite the reaction, over the name of a single woman...

Not just <em>any</em> woman, though. 

&#39;You can dish it out, but you can&#39;t take it, huh? Is that why we&#39;re all the way back here? Trying to hide in the glory of your youth, where you still had a woman to wait on you, so that you don&#39;t have to confront the unsavory parts—&#39;

He couldn&#39;t finish that thought. Immediately, James lunged at him, fist aimed squarely at his face. The blow landed hard, sending him reeling sideways before he caught himself on the edge of the sink.

&#39;Yeah, I had that coming,&#39; the redhead wheezed, wiping away blood from where the punch had connected. &#39;I fucking deserved that...&#39;

He looked up, his face now flushed with fury.

<strong>&#39;...for not breaking you <em>fast</em> enough.&#39;</strong>

A sudden pressure gripped James&#39; neck. Lachlan leaned in closer, his other hand gripped firmly around James&#39; tie. He yanked him forward, slamming his head into the mirror. Glass fractured under the impact, shattering their reflection into a myriad of fragmented images.

&#39;I&#39;m better than this,&#39; Lachlan said, furious not just at James...but more at himself. &#39;This memory is flawed. It&#39;s <em>not good enough.</em> I should have broken you! How do I do it? Where do I find the right memories? Or do I have to do the tormenting myself?&#39;

He contemplated as glass rained down around them. Everything felt so real...was this how those Mystic Eyes worked? Reeling the other in with the memories, wearing them down...so when James tried to stab him earlier...

<em>Did he have to finish the job himself?</em>

He released his grip on James, then bent down to retrieve a shard of the broken mirror from the floor. It felt as if they had been transported back to the hotel, but this time, he intended to cut much more than mere bandages.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620062426660885 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620062426660885><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:49 AM">1:49 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The rush of dopamine he felt landing one flat on his face like that was cathartic. Mmm. A lot of old feelings came flooding back into him. Who would have thought that Young James Rellum would be getting into fights at the Clock Tower? Ooh, if his father saw him now.

That rush couldn&#39;t last forever, though. Soon he instead felt the force from Lachlan&#39;s grip tossing him towards the mirror, shattering it into its new fractured state.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; James&#39;s face was tensed up from the pain of glass shards embedding themselves into his face once again. The cuts left the side of his face Lachlan slammed into the mirror covered in streaks of blood.

Dazed, James stumbled back until he fell clutching his face in pain. A few stomps were made against the restroom floor to help him deal with the agonizing sting of the cuts.

Through the pain, he stared up at Lachlan and he saw...<em>himself</em>. Confused. Struggling to understand how to use this landscape properly. He was a novice.

That was his ticket.

&quot;I knew it... Still just a kid, huh?&quot; James got some words out in between his heavy breathing. One hand held his face to stem the bleeding. The other found a glass shard to arm himself with as well as he stood back up. &quot;I couldn&#39;t hope to puppet one of those abominations like you could. However, the same goes for you using this world.&quot;

The impromptu knife was held down to his waist, primed to strike, as James got ready to fight again. &quot;Come on now.&quot; James took the hand off his face so he could motion for Lachlan to come at him with his bloodied hand.&quot;<strong>Don&#39;t want to get scared now, do we?</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620236431560794 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620236431560794><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:50 AM">1:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Good. His strength was returning. The remnants of pain lingered in his body, but for now, they remained subdued, a mere ghost of an echo. In contrast, the present world, this brightly illuminated...<em>loo</em> within the Clock Tower, stood at the forefront of his consciousness.

<em>It&#39;ll be fine,</em> he thought.

James&#39; remark got a frown out of him. Lachlan stared at the man, who barely looked older than himself. &#39;I don&#39;t <em>miss</em> being a kid, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re insinuating,&#39; he said slowly. &#39;There&#39;s nothing enjoyable about it. I fail to see why you&#39;d be so attached yourself.&#39; 

He drew his hands up in a little flourish and gestured around himself. &#39;Ah, the glorious Clock Tower! The pinnacle of knowledge! You didn&#39;t even want to be here, did you? It was <em>your father&#39;s</em> idea.&#39;

He laughed; it quickly turned into a snarl. &#39;No, there&#39;s nothing funny about it. The similarity ends here. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got reasons to believe that you have the upper hand in <em>this</em> realm. But if it were up to me...&#39;

He loosened his collar and began to circle James, mirroring his movements.

&#39;...you should probably run. After all, I learn pretty fast!&#39;

He struck out. Not with the makeshift blade, but with his entire being. Lachlan launched himself towards James, in a shoulder slam aimed straight at his torso. The cramped bathroom offered little room for a clean evade; neither of them were <em>kids</em>, after all. Even if he had exposed himself for James to draw blood, once he succeeded in throwing James off balance, it would all be over quickly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620290923974697 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620290923974697><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:50 AM">1:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A haphazardly created circle was beginning to form from the blood droplets.

&quot;Simply stating your inexperience with this world is all...&quot; The tension and adrenaline kept his hand from remaining still. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t enough to cause him to lose his grip of his weapon.

As much as his body was screaming at him to make the first move, James understood it was best to react to Lachlan rather than allow himself to act on his impulses. Besides, the longer he took to finish him off, the longer James had to regain control. All he needed was a moment, after all.

All of his thoughts were of how to defend against his knife. So, much to his surprise, the last thing he expected was for him to throw his entire body at him instead. There was little he could do to defend against it. The force of the shoulder slam threw James off his feet and onto the ground a few feet away. 

However, in what was a last resort effort to prevent the shoulder slam, James thrusted the glass shard towards Lachlan as he launched himself at him. It wasn&#39;t as effective at stopping a charge as a spear would&#39;ve been, but it did its part well enough.

Now he was on his back trying to regain the breath that was knocked out of him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620465264410644 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620465264410644><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:51 AM">1:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The glass shard made contact with flesh. Red, syrupy blood splattered across James&#39; face. His makeshift blade ran clean through Lachlan&#39;s hand; the boy didn&#39;t even attempt to dodge, instead <em>pushing down</em> onto the blade as he threw his full weight onto the dark-haired man.

They went down in a heap of tangled arms and legs. Lachlan crawled on top of James, driving his pierced hand down the glass shard until he finally caught hold of the man&#39;s hand. Then, with his full weight and gravity at his side, he pinned the hand down to James&#39; side.

&#39;Told you,&#39; he spoke through clenched teeth. &#39;I learn fast.&#39;

He had already experienced similar tactics, back at the hotel. Old or young, the James before him had a nasty penchant for disabling his opponents by targeting their limbs before going for the kill. However, there was a fundamental flaw in this approach.

It didn&#39;t work as well against someone who was prepared to lose a limb in the first place!

&#39;Hey, <em>punk</em>, if I slap you on the cheek, will you offer up the other one too?&#39; Lachlan said smugly. He raised his other hand—

It was empty. Somewhere in the midst of the struggle, he had let go of his own glass shard.

—and swung a hard punch to James&#39; face.

The blow landed, swiftly followed by another.

&#39;Well, here&#39;s <em>your</em> gift!&#39; Lachlan shouted. Blades, guns, none of them provided the same raw feedback as the impact of his own knuckles against flesh. He was no boxer, and thus wasn&#39;t aware of the most effective techniques. In all likelihood, he was probably hurting his own hands as much as he was hurting James. Nevertheless, he struck with a fierceness that surprised and exhilarated even himself. He had tussled with his twin plenty during their childhood, but nothing like this. Any lingering hesitation melted away, leaving his conscience clear.

Fear of the past. <em>Fear of pain</em>. <strong>Fear of Death</strong>.

That&#39;s why he relied on disabling his opponent&#39;s limbs. The pain would set fear into them. This all falls apart whenever James runs up against something who simply doesn&#39;t care.

Whatever James did, Lachlan just didn&#39;t care about any of it. The pain? Negligible. Death? He knew that this kid must have went into this knowing that was a possibility. Death was more or less accepted by the fools who attended these wars. Only those truly ignorant of that fact, or have yet to come to terms with killing or being killed, had any reason to fear Death.

That is why one must always have backup plans.

&quot;No need! You gave me your hand so willingly! Don&#39;t think I&#39;ll give it back anytime soon!&quot; Even as his face was getting bruised by his fists, inexperienced or not, James still managed to keep a smirk on his face.

With his pinned hand, instead of trying to free his weapon, he grasped onto Lachlan&#39;s hand to keep his impaled hand from being freed as easily. Then the next thing Lachlan felt was something much more worse; <em><strong>heat</strong></em>.

James still had other magecraft on his side, after all! As mana poured into the palm holding the glass shard, the temperature increased drastically. While normally glass was a poor conductor of heat, this wasn&#39;t just glass. This was a <em>mirror</em> shard, which were usually made out of metals.

&quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m incapable of learning either!&quot; To show that, he decided to take a page out of Ann&#39;s book when he fought her.

Intense heat pulsed through his hand like an electric current, radiating from the small piece of glass embedded in his palm. It was overwhelming, intolerable. His wound began to char, flesh boiling and rolling back as an unpleasant, burning odor clogged up the space between him and James.

<strong>&#39;JUST SHUT UP!&#39;</strong> He screamed, hurling insult after insult at James as he tried to drown out his pain. Instinct told him to back off, logic urged him to douse the heat with water, but <em>experience</em>, past experiences told him that if he backed down, if he conceded right here, then nothing, <em>absolutely nothing</em> would change.

Too many times he had played the role of a coward. Each day he pondered what could have been if he hadn&#39;t begged Griffin for help in that damned forest. If only he hadn&#39;t been a coward. If only he hadn&#39;t been so quick to plead for his life, perhaps his twin would have been provoked, allowed the puppet to carry on its assault, pushed it to cross the line, claimed his life...

Then, he wouldn&#39;t have been subjected to the torment of those subsequent years. Death would have offered a more dignified end.

<em>Yeah, that...doesn&#39;t sound so bad.</em>

But, he had already grown accustomed to living like a dog. As much as he tried to conceal his scars behind a dignified appearance, his body still retained the memories of his past. The things he would do for survival, the pride he had to swallow in order to endure another day...

Truly, there was no shame in fighting dirty.

James&#39; headbutt landed hard against his eye socket. Agony seared through his head, his vision swimming as blood streamed down his face. <em><strong>Fuck! It hurts!</strong></em> But pain was good. Pain served a purpose, it told him where to strike. In his blindness, he followed the scent of shampoo on James&#39; hair, the heat radiating from his flushed face. Like a snake tracking its prey, Lachlan dipped his head and sank his teeth into James&#39; neck.

&quot;<strong>GAAAH!!</strong>&quot; His teeth sunk into his neck like a rabid dog. His feet kicked against the floor as he fought back, knocking around more shards and smearing the blood that fell. There was little he could do that wouldn&#39;t end with Lachlan getting a mouthful of his neck.

&quot;<strong>You rabid bastard!</strong>&quot; Nevertheless, James fought on. His nails clawed at the face of wild creature who sunk their fangs into him. With his other hand, he began to twist and angle the searing mirror shard to further worsen the wound as well as the pain.

Time was ticking down for him. Nothing he was doing was working for him. He didn&#39;t have many options left, nor much chances to use the ones he did have. Just what could he do, though?...

Then, whether it was an actual idea that came from him, or just his body acting on the impulse to survive, James&#39; body chose for him.

<strong>THUD</strong>

Among the smeared blood and shards littering the floor, one of his feet found its footing. From the regained strength of a more solid foundation, James was able to send his thigh straight between the legs of Lachlan to strike where he least expected it; his future descendants.

If Lachlan wanted to play dirty then the only one he could really blame was himself for this.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620837802475580 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620837802475580><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:52 AM">1:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nails on his face. Insignificant, easily ignored. His face had already been disfigured, a few more streaks would make little difference. 

Mirror shard burning into his hand. Dreadful, but bearable. The nerves in his hand had already started dying anyway; the more James twisted and turned the heated glass, the quicker the sensation numbed. He was actually <em>helping</em> Lachlan in that regard. 

All signs pointed to James&#39; loss. There was nothing worse he could do anyway—

Until the devastating blow struck him, right in the family jewels!

Lachlan froze. His pupils shriveled to tiny pinpricks before expanding larger than they ever were.

A guttural howl ripped out of his throat, as a most excruciating pain coursed through his nether region. Out of pure reflex, Lachlan clamped down hard with his teeth, wrenching free a small chunk of flesh from James&#39; neck as he collapsed onto his side.

Now that, unquestionably, <em>hurt</em>. Arguably the most painful sensation he had endured thus far. The attack left him paralyzed, curled into a fetal position and granting James a small reprieve to catch his breath.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116620874905292830 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116620874905292830><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:52 AM">1:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan was no later on top between the two of them. He didn&#39;t leave without a part of him inside of his mouth, though. Swiftly, James placed a hand around the place he bit into. It wasn&#39;t bleeding too profusely so he was safe. That alone was enough to bring him relief, even through the pain he felt. 

He knew that he didn&#39;t have long. So, with great pain and groaning, James rolled onto his side so he could get up onto all fours before lifting himself up. If it wasn&#39;t for the wall keeping him up, James would have just stumbled backwards a second time. Not this time though!

&quot;You little bastard. You actually bit me.&quot; James spat out in between his heavy panting in hopes of filling his lungs with the air his body cried out for.

A smirk formed as an idea crossed his mind. Before he put it into motion, James wiped up on his face with his hand, clearing most of the blood and smearing the rest. Afterwards, he ran his hand through his hair, slicking it back with both sweat and blood mixed in. Despite the mess, all he could do was just chuckle at the sight before him.

&quot;To think a Dowling heir would fight like such a savage. <strong>I bet your twin would&#39;ve fought in a more dignifed manner than you, Lachlan.</strong>&quot; Come on now. Slip up.

He breathed, grunted, and his body spasmed. Once the worst of the pain had subsided, he spat out the chunk of torn flesh and rolled back onto all fours.

He was still conscious, much to James&#39; chagrin. To what extent, though, was another question. Despite all the vicious words James had drilled into him, Lachlan made no visible acknowledgement. He remained curled into himself, shaking like a leaf that had just weathered a storm. Had James wasted his breath?

Reality(?) trembled. For a brief moment, James sensed a slight ripple passing through the atmosphere.

Like glass shattering, the shards of the world around them slowly begin to fly into the air before disappearing into the liminal space of nothingness. The previously black void was now an impossibly white emptiness. There was just one single reason this was happening; James severed the connection.

&quot;Time to wake up, kid.&quot; His voice trailed off, not to different from a voice one would hear in a dream moments before they woke up, but not before James was able to get a few more words out. &quot;I have to admit it. You almost beat me, at my own game at that too, but you came up short. Nothing new for you, though, huh?&quot; 

Both of them stood while the erasure of this world was finalized around them. No amount of power or control could stop this. Once broken, only James could reestablish connection between the two. And thanks to the experience he had with Lachlan, that was unlikely to happen.

James did nothing but stand there and laugh at Lachlan. They still had to finish their fight back in reality proper. But here? Victory was given to neither of them in this world. And to James, <em>that</em> was a victory in and of itself.

<em><strong>Time to wake up.</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So, instead, James stood up. He tried, at least. His body <em>screamed</em> at him for even attempting to move. His muscles felt as if they torn themselves twice over but with no physical damage being seen. That was only to the visible eye. The pain both him and Lachlan endured was still present on their bodies. The backlash from their circuits made sure of it.

This plan of his kept failing at the same spot.

That was all it took to shift the balance of power in a battle of the minds. James had undoubtedly struck a sore spot with his premeditated remarks, causing Lachlan&#39;s attention to shift away from upholding the fabricated reality of the Clock Tower, and instead confront his own demons. In that fleeting moment of vulnerability, James seized control once more. However, instead of prolonging their stay within the dreamscape, he rather deemed it wiser to sever the connection at once.

And perhaps he was right. No matter how fragmented the Dowling kid&#39;s psyche may be, engaging in a battle with another Mental Magecraft user came with plenty of risks. Perhaps, it would be prudent to take this fight elsewhere...

The world around them shattered, then converged and coalesced into a bleaker, but more authentic landscape. Everything was as they had left it: the smoldering remains of a once plush pillow, shards of broken sunglasses strewn across the floor, and bedsheets crumpled in a corner, stained with blood...

<strong>They were back in the hotel.</strong>

Lachlan lay slumped on the floor. His face was relaxed, serene. It was a face befitting someone in the prime of their youth, untouched by the burdens of their past. Which, considering all that had happened to him, was nothing short of a miracle. 

Yet, just a few inches away from his head, his hand still clutched the seven-shooter tightly. The sight of it snapped James back to their grim reality. This was no ordinary kid; he was a magus—a Master who had willingly entered the Holy Grail War, prepared to lay their life on the line for the pursuit of some elusive wish.

James had never quite grasped the nature of Lachlan&#39;s wish, but perhaps that, too, was irrelevant at this point. After all, knowing the specifics wouldn&#39;t make his own pursuit of the Grail any easier; in the grand scheme of things, the kid merely stood as another obstacle for him to overcome...

&#39;...Quite the spectacle you&#39;ve put on for me.&#39; Words strained against his throat, as if each utterance caused him immense pain. The phantom pain he had accrued from the dream world and the injuries he had sustained in the real world overlapped with one another; they ravaged his body and made him wish he could pass out right there. 

He wouldn&#39;t be getting up any time soon. But even so, Lachlan held fast to James, like a dog snapping at his ankle and refusing to let go. In his other hand, he dragged his gun from the floor, until its barrel shakily aligned with James.

&#39;Shouldn&#39;t have released me so soon.&#39; He leveled the gun and fired.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116621562783735848 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116621562783735848><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:55 AM">1:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__attachment chatlog__attachment--hidden" onclick=showSpoiler(event,this)><div class=chatlog__attachment-spoiler-caption>SPOILER</div><a href="discord_assets/SPOILER_aaaaaaa-FF318.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/SPOILER_aaaaaaa-FF318.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: SPOILER_aaaaaaa.png (2.53 MB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116621585248440411 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116621585248440411><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 1:55 AM">1:55 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Shit!&quot;

<strong>BANG</strong>

A quick reinforcement spell was placed on his coat as he used it to cover most of his body. This time he actually saw it coming. 

The bullet ricocheted, sending James back onto the ground from the impact alone. The bruising from it was felt almost immediately.

Fortunately, Lachlan hanging onto him worked to his advantage. To prevent another shot from going off, James kicked the gun from his hand as it spun and slid across the floor. Ha!

It wasn&#39;t unexpected. It was an outcome he had anticipated, even. His grip on the weapon had been abysmal, courtesy of all the torment he had been subjected to, both physically and mentally. The gun would have been knocked out of him from the recoil alone had James not gotten to it first.

But still, it hurt. Stung his pride. Though the outcome would have been the same, the fact that his gun had been forcibly taken from him amplified the blow. He saw the visible hardening of James&#39; clothes; <em>heard</em> it too, as the bullet rebounded from the hardened fabric. James had cast his own Reinforcement Magecraft. Surprisingly quick, too.

&#39;As expected from a dropout at the Clock Tower...&#39; he said sarcastically, his grip on James&#39; ankle tightening ever more slightly. Mana flushed through his own circuits, traversing the length of his arm and coalescing in his palm—

A sharp pain erupted from James&#39; ankle. A ruby-colored stake impaled the exposed section of flesh, driving itself through the narrow crevice between his heel bone and the precious tendon that governed his mobility.

&#39;...But that was careless. You dig your own grave.&#39; The Dowling heir added. He gripped the end of the bloody stake and started carving it through the wound. The sight of blood surrounding his hand, disproportional to James&#39; own bleeding, clued James in on his method: he had <strong>transmuted</strong> his own blood, exacted by James&#39; own Nail, into a makeshift weapon!

Disarm or not, any fancy moves were utterly pointless if he couldn&#39;t cross that finish line and snuff out the kid&#39;s life.

A retort barely formed upon the tip of his tongue before a excruciating pain stole his voice completely. &quot;<strong>GRAAHH!!!</strong>&quot; The makeshift stake torn through his flesh and tendon, creating a grisly wound that pierced straight through. His hands grasped onto the thigh of the leg that has been stabbed in hopes it would lessen the pain coursing throughout his entire leg while he writhed in pain. 

Blood spurted out as the stake was carved through his heel. 

James&#39; Silver Nail was a clean stab. The mirror shard was broken but still provided a clean cut. <em>This</em> was just downright messy. The crimson ichor that coated the area did more than just show that. It was as if it was making a point out of it.

But it would be all too easy if James fell no different than Achilles from a wound on his heel, now wouldn&#39;t it.

&quot;<strong>Fuck. Off!</strong>&quot; Each word was enunciated with a stomp from his other foot aimed directly at Lachlan&#39;s face.

The blow struck him out of nowhere. Lachlan&#39;s vision went black for a split second. Dazed and very much disoriented, he fought to maintain his grip on James—

<em>STOMP!</em>

The second blow sent him crashing into the bedpost. The impact knocked the wind out of him. At the same time, he felt something warm trickle down his face. Instinctively, he stuck out his tongue, and tasted the metallic tang of his own blood.

Panic. Panic surged through him. Lachlan let go of the blood knife. His hands flew to his face in alarm, searching for any signs of injury inflicted by James&#39; powerful kicks. This wasn&#39;t like the dreamscape; this was reality, where injuries held lasting consequences. It was only recently that he had finally patched up his face after that wretched Coroner had bitten through it. It had costed him a lot, and he was not looking forward to have his—<em>Griffin&#39;s</em>—face be marred again!

With a frustrated snarl he grabbed the closest thing he could get his hands on—which turned out to be, hilariously, James&#39; foot as it descended for the <em>third</em> time. Lachlan&#39;s hand was knocked to the side, before being mercilessly fractured under James&#39; stomp.

Then came another. And another. Stomp after stomp rained down on him, and it took all he had to shield his face from further harm. A quick activation of his Magic Circuits called forth a <strong>Reinforcement Spell</strong>. It lessened the impact of James&#39; onslaught, but still he remained trapped between the man and the unyielding bedpost.

&#39;<em><strong>You</strong></em> fuck off! This the best you can do? My puppets have done worse!&#39; He ran his mouth wildly, all the while darting his eyes around the room in desperation. Where had he dropped his gun? <em>Where?!</em>

The weapon was still embedded into his heel, albeit a bit loosely, but it was probably better if he left it in there for the time being. He had other matters to focus on right now anyways.

Even with his defences, James did not relent in his assault on Lachlan. &quot;I would have preferred this to be quick and clean, kid! You brought this upon yourself!&quot; The reinforcement spell didn&#39;t last forever. All he needed to do was to keep at it until it wore off. A few more seconds of torture was all he bought himself. That is until James saw his true intentions.

His eyes widen upon seeing the attempt for the gun. Persistent bastard! That was his only way to even the odds between the two of them from the looks of things. His only weapon barring the puppets in his control. Fortunately, James figured that one had to be crazy to have one inside the hotel around so many people.

James scrambled on one foot, reaching for one of the Silver Nails he dropped before going to sleep, and brought it straight down upon the hand making a grab for the gun. His other hand was placed on the other end of it so he could bring more of his weight down with it. This way it could pierce into the floor to pin it, and his hand, in place. 

The kid had a good idea, though...

With a few hops, thanks to his heel being torn into, the gun was picked up by one of them. Unfortunately for Lachlan, the hand that grabbed it wasn&#39;t his own.

The metallic clicks from the cylinder of the revolver spinning were no different from the seconds being counted down before Lachlan experienced this last sight in this world; down the barrel of his own gun.

James was no ace shot. Nor did he have any experience with firearms. However, he understood the gist of it. One end towards the other and pull the trigger. With a target so close, even he couldn&#39;t miss this shot.

&quot;Sorry this had to be this way, kid. Maybe next time.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117385503029870612 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117385503029870612><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 4:31 AM">4:31 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>&#39;UGH!&#39;</strong> Lachlan snarled. His hand was now pinned to the floor, immobilized like an insect on a corkboard. A sense of deja vu washed over him; it seemed that karma had decided to catch up with him in this very moment, giving him a taste of what he had done to the Coroner. 

The pain, naturally, was excruciating. The Nail buried deep, several inches into the floorboard. He wouldn&#39;t be getting it out any time soon, not with his <em>other</em> hand equally busted. However, the state of his hands was only the least of his worries. The fact that James had chosen to immobilized him now meant that—

<em>clic</em>

He raised his head and found himself staring directly into the muzzle of his own gun, pointed directly at his head.

<em>Of-fucking-course.</em>

James held him in check. There was no way he would miss a point-blank shot. Lachlan&#39;s mind raced as he weighed his options. It seemed that there was only one thing he could do, in a dire situation like this...

&#39;You wouldn&#39;t.&#39; He uttered in quiet defiance.

It wasn&#39;t a statement; it was a gamble. Lachlan lowered his gaze. The next time he looked up, his expression had transformed into something calculated, deliberate...and <em>soft</em>—the blank, lost look of a defenseless kid.

&#39;...Father, have I let you down?&#39; He continued with a slight tremor in his voice, his eyes growing wide just enough to give James that perfect deer-in-headlights look. In a matter of seconds, his pretense had evaporated; the anger, the pain...it was all gone, replaced with the guise of a pitiful creature.

God damn it. Even if James saw through his act, Lachlan was a <em>really</em> good actor. Was this yet another talent he possessed, or had it been honed through experience?

Another <em>kid</em>, with bleached blonde hair and looking no older than Lachlan, burst into the room. In his hand clutched a paper bag, displaying the logo of a local pharmacy. The sight of Lachlan sprawled on the floor caused him to nearly drop the bag, and when his gaze travelled to the unfamiliar presence in the room, he actually, properly dropped the bag.

Just a squeeze was needed. Nothing more.

Except that bullet never left the chamber and claimed Lachlan&#39;s life.

Why? <em>Because he hesitated</em>. Not because he was about to claim a life. James was prepared to do that. What he didn&#39;t expect was for Lachlan to make a grasp for his parental side. His expression softened after hearing those words. The barrel of the gun was tilted down slightly as well. Through his quick thinking, Lachlan bought himself a few precious seconds. Seconds that would prove to be vital with the arrival of another before James&#39; resolve returned.

<em>&#39;&#39;WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!&#39;</em>

Panic coursed through James. Regardless of who it was, the gun was raised once more towards the person who just came into the suite. He couldn&#39;t take the chance that they were also armed.

<strong>BANG!</strong>

Another shot was fired off. No experience nor time to line up the shot meant it would very likely miss its target, much to the dismay of James, of course.

It gave Roland everything he needed to know about the situation, though; someone was making an attempt on Lachlan&#39;s life.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117600976711458897 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117600976711458897><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 6:47 PM">6:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of all the times he could have returned, he chose now?!

&#39;The fuck are <em><strong>you</strong></em> doing?!&#39; Lachlan dropped his act at once. There was no need to play the victim anymore. After all...

<s>Roland had come back for him</s>
The perfect decoy had arrived.

A part of him fluttered at the sight of his <s>friend</s> <s>associate</s> pawn. That sentiment was short-lived, however, as he quickly reassessed the situation. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught James turning his body towards the door. The time to act was now, or never!

In one painful, but decisive motion, Lachlan steeled himself and tore his hand free from under the Nail. He bit down on the urge to cry out as his hand hung limply. The Nail had sliced through the flesh between his middle finger and ring finger, effectively bisecting the upper part of his palm.

&#39;Don&#39;t just stand there!&#39; He barked orders at the blonde.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What if you got ambus—&#39;

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

A bullet whizzed past his head, nicking a few strands of his hair before embedding itself into the wall. Splinters exploded in his face. Roland staggered back, catching himself on the doorframe. In his moment of panic, he nearly tripped over the bottle of pills, inadvertently kicking it and sending it careening down the hall.

<em>Shit. <strong>Shit!</strong> An enemy Master, and he looks tough as hell!</em>

Roland yanked his hand out of his pocket, clutching whatever he could grab. It turned out to be a lighter—

<em>Better than nothing!</em>

—He hurled the small trinket in James&#39; direction without a second thought.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Have you learned <em>nothing</em> from your student days? Do something useful for once!&#39; He shouted over one shoulder, then, channeling every ounce of strength in his legs, launched himself at James.

Frustration twisted his expression into a scowl at the lack of precision he had. He could precisely sever even the smallest Qi points on someone&#39;s body but he couldn&#39;t hit a target that wasn&#39;t even that far away with a gun. Of course, experience played a huge part in that and he had none with this gun. Nevertheless, rational or not, the man still berated himself in his mind for his mistakes.

Before he could line up another shot, Roland retaliated... with a lighter? No matter how ineffective the lighter was, it was still enough to make James raise his arms up to block it, having expected something much more dangerous. Another shot was fired off, going wide towards the ceiling this time, thanks to James&#39; finger still remaining on the trigger. Trigger discipline was clearly a foreign concept for him! 

&quot;I don&#39;t have any qualms with killing him! Don&#39;t think I will have any towards yo-!!!&quot; The next surprise came from Lachlan suddenly latching himself onto his back, cutting off his words as he struggled to stay upright with just one working foot. Since his arms were raised, that made grabbing onto the hand that held the gun all the more easier for him. Now a tug-of-war happened between the two which prevented James from using the gun, and wasting more bullets, as the two of them fought.

The Nail was embedded deep into the ground. No way he was able to pry it free! Even if it was for just a moment, he saw the disfigured state of his hand. So that&#39;s how, huh? Kid had guts, he had to give him that.

Together they stumbled into a table, scattering the contents on it to the ground. In another attempt to get him off his back, James turned around so he could launch himself backwards to the cart he brought into the room to crush Lachlan between him and the cart. The cart was still mobile so it wouldn&#39;t prove to be the effective wall James previously thought, of course, but it was something.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117956712679358587 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117956712679358587><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 12, 2023 6:20 PM">6:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two kids trashing each other on the bathroom floor, both with too much energy to spare.

But this, this was on a whole other level. Lachlan clung to James&#39; back as the man thrashed around the room, and for a moment Lachlan had the distinct feeling that he was grappling with a bear.

And he might as well have been, due to the discrepancy in strength and stature between him and James, which left him devastatingly outmatched. Even with all the injuries that had chipped away at James&#39; health, they barely broke even.

Roland&#39;s presence had proved futile as well, as the blonde&#39;s stunned silence rendered him as useless as a mannequin. Even a <strong>mutt</strong> would have reacted better in this situation!

<strong>&#39;The Dancer!&#39;</strong> Lachlan bellowed, as James tackled them both into the service cart. The impact crushed the air from his lungs, causing another slew of bruises to bloom on his back. Tumbling backwards, he collided with the floor as the cart toppled over, sending cleaning supplies soaring through the air before descending upon him and James both.

Roland dashed down the hallway, stopping before another door. His hand trembled a bit as he grasped the doorknob. With a nervous glance back at the redhead, he twisted the handle.

He barely pushed the door more than a couple of inches from its resting place when a gray claw emerged from the crack, flinging the door open the rest of the way. A lithe creature slipped out of the room, sniffing the air excitedly as it sensed its release. Its appearance was unmistakably humanoid, yet every aspect of its body seemed to have been stretched vertically, forming an unnaturally slender and elongated silhouette.

Heart pounding in his chest, Roland slowly backed away. But the creature didn&#39;t seem to be interested in him. Instead, its attention was immediately drawn to the epicenter of the chaos.

The upturned cart!

Excitement seemed to radiate from the creature&#39;s slender frame. Swiftly, it darted towards the struggling magi, like a rabid beast that had been unchained and set loose upon its prey!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118051699995725834 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118051699995725834><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 13, 2023 12:38 AM">12:38 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan was tossed aside while James was getting up using the fallen cart for support. The absence of the gun in his hand meant it must have fell somewhere. Shit. Like hell he can allow the kid to find it first! 

His search didn&#39;t have much time to take off before his attention was directed elsewhere.

<em>&#39;Summon the Dancer! Now!&#39;</em>

&quot;The what?&quot; By the time the two finished yelling at each other, James remembered what the Dancer was from Lachlan&#39;s memories. Marcus warned him about the kid&#39;s puppets before as well. &quot;...Oh no.&quot;

James barely had a second to peer over his shoulder before the nightmarish abomination rushed together them. The fear he felt was primordial from how uncanny the Dancer appeared to be human but at the same time resembled nothing like a human. The sweat he felt on him was <em>cold</em>. 

His fight-or-flight instinct kicked in.

&quot;Shitshitshitshit!&quot; James scrambled once more to leap out of the Dancer as they ran towards them. Pain spiked throughout his body but he feared that <em>thing</em> more than the pain in his body. His hand was unsteady but he still managed to reach behind him to check on his Silver Nails. 

Still one left. He couldn&#39;t afford to lose this one, especially against this thing! The rest are either embedded in Lachlan or the ground alike. 

The situation here kept going from bad to worse to absolutely terrible with each passing minute. 

Perhaps he could escape amidst the chaos? No. This thing would outrun him even on a good day. 

Damnit! He is so close to finishing off his target! The frustration mixed with the fear caused his teeth to struggle between grinding against each other and shaking. 

He needed to avoid staring this thing in the eyes too. He wasn&#39;t sure if it would activate but the last place he&#39;d want to be is inside of that thing&#39;s mind so he wasn&#39;t going to take that chance.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118142426561912992 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118142426561912992><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 13, 2023 6:38 AM">6:38 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A wave of nausea hit him as he tried to reorient himself. In the depths of his mind, he sensed the Dancer&#39;s restlessness. The creature had been confined in the spare room for far too long, clawing at the walls and chewing at the bedsheets in anticipation of its release. Just how many hours had it spent lurking and waiting?

But now that it had been set free, all that pent up energy finally had an outlet. Roland was a fool to doubt his decisions!

Lachlan watched as the creature rushed down the hallway. He saw the panic in James&#39; eyes as he tried to get away, and it brought him savage satisfaction. How far did James think he could flee with his injured leg? In an instant, the beast would tear him to shreds—

A shadow loomed over him, accompanied by the scent of sweat, blood, and chemicals. He felt heat on the back of his neck, compelling him to turn around...

...And come face to face with the Dancer.

<strong>&#39;?&#39;</strong> 
The creature&#39;s head swiveled almost a full 180 degrees, its face mere inches away from Lachlan&#39;s as it breathed down the puppeteer&#39;s neck.

Lachlan blinked. &#39;What?&#39; He asked impatiently.

<strong>&#39;?&#39;</strong> 
The Dancer sniffed at Lachlan&#39;s hair.

&#39;Not me,&#39; Lachlan clamped his good hand around the Dancer&#39;s chin and forcefully directed its gaze towards James. &#39;Get <strong>him</strong>! Go!&#39; 

<strong>&#39;!!!!&#39;</strong> 
The Dancer hissed like a rattlesnake as it resisted being manhandled. It snapped open its jaws and attempted to bite down, and Lachlan only managed to whip his arm out of the way just in time to avoid it being turned into ribbons.

<strong>&#39;The fuck is wrong with you?!&#39;</strong> Lachlan roared.

No. That wasn&#39;t it. He knew <em>exactly</em> what was wrong—not with the Dancer, but <em>himself</em>. His control was slipping. His mind hadn&#39;t been right ever since the day Pyg had gone berserk. He made the decision to lock the Dancer away as a precaution!

He refused to acknowledge the issue.

He couldn&#39;t get through to his puppet, let alone overpower its instincts!

Surprisingly though, it ignored him and stared at Lachlan instead. James froze for a second out of pure shock and confusion. Well, if the Dancer went for their master instead then that gives James a free ticket out of here!

Then why isn&#39;t he leaving?

His legs weren&#39;t frozen with fear. Though a bit shaky because of the damage done to his heel, James could stand up quite fine. There would be no issue running away. All he would need to do is deal with that Roland kid. Something that wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue with what he saw so far.

So why? 

Why isn&#39;t he taking this chance to run! <em>It&#39;s because of that damn Dowling kid</em>. 

The look of fear in his face at such a creature sealed his fate through inaction, or the inability to control the Dancer. It didn&#39;t matter. The end result was the same. 

The thing would tear and mutilate the kid in seconds. It will be unlikely that it would be a clean ordeal, nor painless. After that, the next target would be James. Then he&#39;ll share the same fate as Lachlan, even with the head start he has. He saw how fast the thing was, after all.

His other arm, which gripped tight James&#39; last Silver Nail, stabbed into the chest of the thing repeatedly. 

The Dancer viciously hissed in pain as it thrashed around. The claws tearing up the beds and walls alike trying to get at James. The panic that set in made it difficult for the rabid mind to strike at James&#39; arm set itself free and instead lashed out at everything around it while more puncture wounds formed after each stab. 

James kept pulling the Dancer away from places where it could possibly trip then he would had to deal with being on the ground with this thing instead. This rodeo made it almost impossible to land precise stabs at vital organs. He swore a few of them landed true which fed into the fear in his mind that this thing might not need vital organs to operate. If so, then how the hell is he going to get out of this mess!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118317337486032938 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118317337486032938><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 13, 2023 6:13 PM">6:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He knew the Dancer would break free from its owner&#39;s control. He <em>knew</em> this.

But he also knew that if he didn&#39;t comply with Lachlan&#39;s demands, then chances were high that James would kill Lachlan. And next in line would be him.

There was no way he could match the power of a Magus who could overpower Lachlan, even if Lachlan wasn&#39;t playing his best. The situation had spiraled far beyond his control. Roland was at a loss: what could he possibly do? Even if he jumped into the foray, could he subdue the Dancer? Could he fend off James?

<em>He could only ever be a burden.</em>

No, this wasn&#39;t a defeatist mindset speaking, but rather a clear understanding of his own capabilities. Being intimately acquainted with his mediocrity had given Roland a keen sense of self-awareness regarding his limitations. Right now, he had assessed everything, as calmly as he could, and came to the conclusion that his direct involvement would only further complicate matters. What Lachlan needed was tangible, decisive results that could sway the outcome in his favor.

There was only one thing he could do.

<strong>&#39;I&#39;VE GOT AN IDEA!&#39;</strong> Roland shouted at the puppeteer. <strong>&#39;JUST HANG IN THERE, I&#39;LL BE BACK!&#39;</strong>

A busboy. A messenger. A chauffeur. This was the position he had placed himself in. It was the price tag he had attached to his worth. Though his skills in magecraft was third-rate at best, he still possessed the competence as an assistant. And when his boss was in danger...

<em>Gotta find Archer,</em> he thought. <em>This is what I can do.</em>

With a silent prayer that the stranger and the Dancer would keep each other company long enough for his gamble, Roland bolted out the door, down the hotel, and into the bustling streets of downtown Berenice...</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 12:21 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The room retreated from him. He was dimly aware of an impending panic attack: the chill that gripped his limbs, the shallowness of his breaths that left him starved for oxygen. Darkness encroached on his vision, making him hyperaware of the Dancer&#39;s claw, descending upon him as if in slow motion...

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

The Dancer, as if struck by an invisible force, deviated from its path. 

Lachlan blinked stupidly. Why hadn&#39;t the slashes come yet? Instinctively, he wanted to curl up into a ball and brace for the inevitable...but the inevitable never came. Instead, distant sounds of fighting reached his ears, rousing him from his daze. He propped himself up on his elbows as his mind and vision gradually aligned, choosing to focus on the present moment rather than the haunting memories of the past.

To his astonishment—and, perhaps even more than that, <em>bewilderment</em>—he found James engaged in a fierce struggle with his puppet.

&#39;What?&#39; He stared.

Reached out to the Dancer with his mind.

And failed.

The Dancer remained beyond his influence. Even now, as he observed the puppet&#39;s movements more closely, Lachlan realized that it wasn&#39;t solely fixated on attacking James. Rather, it was only lashing out in response to anything that provoked it, and James just so happened to be its newest tormentor right now.

But things still didn&#39;t add up. Why was James suddenly on top the creature? 

Lachlan continued to stare. In this moment, he had become less than useless—reduced to a mere spectator who not only wasn&#39;t helping, but whose presence seemed to be a hindrance. The least he could do was remove himself from harm&#39;s way and make James&#39; job a little bit easier!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118408049430892585 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118408049430892585><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 12:14 AM">12:14 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He wasn&#39;t wrong about being torn to shreds if this thing got to him! 

<em>stab! stab! stab!</em>

More stabs were made upon this thing&#39;s chest. This wasn&#39;t going to work. He needed a different plan if he was to take the Dancer down. This thing&#39;s Qi points were all over the place and were too numerous to actually be of any effect against it. Burning it was out of the question as well. It&#39;d take too long and too much Mana to accomplishment. Besides, it was unlikely that this thing would simply allow James to barbeque it without a fight either.

So, he did what he knew do in this situation; talk shit to Lachlan.

&quot;<strong>If you are going to shit yourself and stay there then why don&#39;t you do both of us a favour and get away from here! Or better yet! Make yourself useful and help me bring this thing down before it ends up killing both of us, you damn useless puppeteer!</strong>&quot; 

To help vent during this stressful and life-threatening situation James found himself so foolishly in, he barked at the nearby person he could find, which just happened to be a dumbfounded Lachlan. 

&quot;<strong>Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not willing to let this thing jus-GAAHH!!</strong>&quot; While he was distracted yelling at him, the Dancer found an opportunity to tumble backwards into the wall, leaving an crater in the wall after crushing James up against the wall. With all of the air out of his lungs, James strained to maintain his grip.

James&#39; outburst startled Lachlan back to reality. Despite his ongoing confusion, his body reacted to the man&#39;s words. More specifically, the word <em>&#39;useless&#39;</em>.

That jolted him upright. <em>Stupid widower! How dare he call him useless?!</em> Lachlan clenched his fists. He winced as pain spread like wildfire through his disfigured hand. It hurt like hell! But it also hurt him good. It hurt like a slap to the face that he sorely needed.

<strong>&#39;Shut up! Haven&#39;t I made myself clear?! Just shut UP!&#39;</strong> His fists battered the floor in sudden fury. <strong>&#39;Don&#39;t you <em>dare</em> tell me what to do!&#39;</strong>

He struggled to his feet. &#39;The Dancer is <em><strong>my</strong></em> property! If anyone has the right to punish it, it&#39;s me! I don&#39;t need your damned charity!&#39;

He looked around, his gaze falling upon the service cart. With a burst of strength that surprised even himself, he gripped the handle and turned it upright.

<strong>&#39;Now move aside!&#39;</strong> He roared at James, before breaking into a sprint and driving the cart towards the puppet. <strong>&#39;I&#39;m not going to repeat myself!&#39;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118513704909156413 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118513704909156413><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 7:14 AM">7:14 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was it smart for snapping your opponent out of a daze? Perhaps not. James couldn&#39;t care about that. Not with the nightmare he was riding the back of still lashing out despite the multiple puncture wounds on its chest. Damn thing didn&#39;t even slow down a bit! 

The sensation of relief from Lachlan&#39;s aid was soon replaced with a searing pain upon his side. &quot;<strong>SHIT!</strong>&quot; His eyes shot wide open as the rest of the air in his lungs was stolen in a breathless gasp of pain. One of the many swipes from the Dancer found its mark finally and dug its way into his side. The long claws made short work of his coat and shirt. It made shorter work of the flesh underneath. No amount of flesh or muscle was enough to halt the claw&#39;s path as it torn into James. 

This allowed for the Dancer to finally toss James off of their back and tumbling onto the bed before they rolled off onto the ground. His hand grasping onto the wound as the coat was stained with an ever-growing dark red patch where the claws sunk into.

As unfortunate as it was, the silver lining was that he wasn&#39;t caught with the Dancer once the cart collided against the back of the creature. 

The weight of the cart was, luckily, enough to run over the Dancer with. Not crushing it completely, but definitely pinning it between the wall and the cart so it could be dealt with later. 

For now, Lachlan still had an intruder to deal with. 

The gash in his side made it difficult to stand but, with the support of the wall and bed together, James was able to barely stand once more. The Silver Nail in his hand was glowing a bright red. The air around it simmered from the heat alone. James was aiming to finish this little duel of theirs in the next move.

If that didn&#39;t make Lachlan&#39;s situation worse, the cart wouldn&#39;t hold the Dancer forever either...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118660762223779931 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118660762223779931><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 4:58 PM">4:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cart rammed squarely into the Dancer&#39;s back. Lachlan exerted all his strength as pressed the cart firmly against the creature, effectively pinning it between the cart and the wall. It took him a few seconds to catch his breath, while his heart gradually returned to a more reasonable beat. 

However, there was no sense of relief in his mind. From the feedback in his arms alone, he could tell that the cart hadn&#39;t inflicted any serious damage to the Dancer—which was only to be expected, seeing that <em>he</em> had created the damn thing in the first place. It was great when things were working smoothly, but right now, the creature&#39;s durability had become an inconvenience.

Of course, as both its creator and trainer, Lachlan knew more ways to disable the Dancer even without mind control. The most efficient and cost-effective method would be to target its brain, and judging from the multiple stab wounds on the puppet&#39;s back, James had certainly made an attempt...

A pang of annoyance hit him. The sight of the man—bloodied but alive, armed and ready to strike—stirred some inexplicable emotion within him that he couldn&#39;t quite pin down. And of course, when confronted with something he didn&#39;t understand, the puppeteer&#39;s first reaction was to <strong>scowl</strong>.

&#39;You just wasted your best shot,&#39; he said, eyeing the red-hot Nail in James&#39; hand. &#39;If I were you, I&#39;d have used that Nail already. Or better yet, let my Skinwalker finish the job on its own. That was careless, sloppy, and downright stupid.&#39; 

He scrutinized James&#39; actions harshly. Of course, if their positions were flipped, then he would have locked the room behind him and left James to fend off the Dancer on his own. The fact that James hadn&#39;t even thought of such a simple strategy was utterly inconceivable.

The puppeteer sneered.

In truth, James had been running on empty for awhile now. Whatever source of energy have been pushing him further was running out. The drips of vigor were less frequent than the last.

So what would be the correct course of action to make? Well, the wrong choice would be to waste energy barking back a-

&quot;We both know if you did that, <em>you</em> would fail to control it yourself. If you could control it, there weren&#39;t be any need to lock it away like that, now wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; To matters worse, James had the gall to smirk at Lachlan. He knew the kid&#39;s moves; managing control wasn&#39;t one of them right now.

&quot;I still have a weapon. You don&#39;t. Your only choice is effectively suicide if you let that thing loose again.&quot; The man took a step closer to Lachlan. &quot;What will it be, kid? <strong>Death by assassination or death because of your own incompetence.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119421321969934457 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119421321969934457><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 7:20 PM">7:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He got him. Lachlan hated when his opponents had two braincells to rub together. James was doing exactly that, and it made him seethe.

So he chose to mirror James&#39; tone. &#39;Kid this, kid that,&#39; he spat. &#39;Look at you, all high and mighty just because you&#39;ve managed to procreate and pass on your genes. You fancy yourself an assassin, yet here I am, still breathing. What kind of assassination technique is this? Death by attrition? Is that the best you can do?&#39;

<em>THUMP</em>

The Dancer squirmed against the pressure of the cart. Lachlan fought to keep it in place, as he felt himself being pushed away.

He put more weight on the cart. &#39;Go ahead, give it a try,&#39; he taunted James. The Dancer pushed against the cart once more, its claws catching on it and starting to slice through the top board.

&#39;Try and stab me, see what happens. Won&#39;t be the first time I&#39;ve clawed my way back from a stab wound...but you?&#39; He let out a derisive laugh, bluffing as if his life depended on it. &#39;Why, you couldn&#39;t even take down a <em>kid</em> when he was alone. What makes you think you stand a chance now, when there&#39;s a—&#39;

<em>THUMP</em>

&#39;—dangerous beast in the mix?&#39; 

The cart began to fold as the Dancer clawed cracks into the structure. Lachlan eyed the distance between himself and the door. Could he make it if he made a break for it? 

<em>THUMP—CRACK!</em>

The Dancer did not give him time to ponder his options. The cart split apart as the puppet&#39;s claws sliced through the cheap wood and plastic. Lachlan was thrown off balance, tumbling towards James—

His circuits flared. <strong>Projection Magecraft</strong> flushed through his veins, and in his hand materialized a single dagger. Lachlan swung the blade upward as he aimed at James, banking on the man&#39;s instinct to dodge aside so he could make a dash for the door!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119578478539444314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119578478539444314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 5:45 AM">5:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The closer James got, the closer the last strike would be made. The metaphorical clock continued to tick down with sounds of the Dancer breaking free as the tocks. A choice needed to be made now. 

And one was made. 

&quot;...?!?&quot; The sudden knife caused James to thrust his Nail towards the tumbling Lachlan as well. The heat alone made it a dangerous weapon beyond just simple stabbing power now as the two traded blows again. A cut was made on James&#39; shoulder as his already weak balance made him fall onto the ground, freeing up the path for Lachlan&#39;s true intent.

To Flee.

With how proud James thought Lachlan was, this wasn&#39;t an option he thought the kid would choose. Thus it was the perfect move to make due to the fact that James didn&#39;t see it coming.

Thanks to the wounds he acquired up to this point, it made recovering from the tumble much harder. The time granted by that little gamble gave a generous head start. More time was given once James got up to follow after him and heard the vicious hiss from the Dancer who attempted to give chase as well. 

&quot;Damnit!&quot; Unfortunately giving Lachlan more time to run, James ran out into the hallway and, with his grip held tightly to secure the door, slammed the door shut to brace himself for the impact. The weight of the Dancer soon crashed against the door, nearly splintering it open. A quick Reinforcement spell beforehand kept it from shattering through. 

Now, with a damaged ankle, James had to chase down the kid before he got to another puppet, or worse; his Servant.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 9:03 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119623286746255380 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119623286746255380><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 8:43 AM">8:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

But strength wasn&#39;t all there was to it. An adaptability to one&#39;s environments, an ability to weather the storms of change and emerge whole—that was where its truest essence lay.

Lachlan had adapted. He had learned to yield, to lower his head when necessary. To keep his ego in check. He had learned to play the waiting game, bided his time, and emerged victorious over his twin brother.

It wasn&#39;t because he was inherently stronger than Griffin. No, he had won because Griffin had <em>lost</em>. He had lived on while Griffin had <em>perished</em>.

And now, the same principle shall apply to James.

James&#39; wounds were far from superficial. The Dancer, albeit wild, posed a danger to <em>both</em> of them. Lachlan understood that the key to his triumph lay in introducing as many risks to James as possible, while minimizing the risks he took himself. The more precarious the situation for James, the greater the likelihood that he would meet his end before Lachlan.

That was all he needed. It was his own unique brand of pride. Lachlan did not always win his wars with a decisive strike...

<em>CRASH!</em>

The sound of glass shattering resonated through the lounge. The window near the couch was broken, leaving behind a hole large enough to fit a person through. By the time James had freed himself from the Dancer&#39;s entanglement, the redhead was nowhere to be seen. The only souvenir he had left behind was a torn piece of fabric clinging to a jagged edge of the broken window glass. The telltale bloodstains on the fabric left no doubt that it belonged to the kid...

Had Lachlan escaped through the window? But they were all the way up on the <em>fifth</em> floor! The feat of climbing down drainage pipes or performing gravity defying parkour maneuvers down the building was something only seen in <em>movies</em>!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119737378471415838 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119737378471415838><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 17, 2023 4:16 PM">4:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With no target in sight, the creature appeared to have calmed down. Well, that was someone&#39;s else issue now. As James hobbled to see what caused it, he arrived at the site of the broken window. No, he didn&#39;t...

The blood trail, and the lack of Lachlan around, were all the clues he needed to know that this kid was actually insane enough to attempt something like this. Not that it was stupid either. His choices were to either die here, die trying, or make it and be given a chance to live. 

A glance outside the window, and the lack of a Lachlan decorating the ground below, told him it was the third outcome. Great. 

Now with renewed purpose, James made his way down the safe way to chase after him.
