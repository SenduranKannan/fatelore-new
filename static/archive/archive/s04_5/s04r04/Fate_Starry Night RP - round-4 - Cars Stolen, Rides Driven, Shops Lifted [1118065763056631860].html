Illyn had committed crimes far too numerous to count during his life as a wanted man, running from Enforcers. Escaping by ship in Oceania, blowing up an apartment complex in Peru, shooting one squarely in the face in America. 

Even with Magecraft, crime took a modicum of effort for the average magus. You couldn&#39;t just wave your hand and convince someone to do anything you desired. You had to commit. 

Illyn didn&#39;t do this. He had an infinite amount of tools that allowed him to skirt past hurdles that would stump an ordinary magus. When Illyn and Rider had pulled into the gas station that Illyn correctly guessed, there was the car that Rider had predicted.

Without further ado, Illyn slid into the passenger seat and unlocked the driver door. For some reason, people tended to lock one side of the vehicle and not the other. As Rider got situated and Illyn put on his seatbelt, a man had come storming out of the gas station towards <s>his</s> their car.

He quickly cursed out Rider and Illyn in rapid-fire Egyptian while Illyn opened IBM. 

Alchemy was simply changing the state of an item. All of Illyn&#39;s properties had been bought with mass-produced items, and this was no different.

As the man cursed out Rider, Illyn gave his Servant a glance of disdain and printed a golden bar out of IBM. He tapped the man&#39;s forehead, placed the golden bar in his hands, and persuaded him to accept the trade.

&quot;Thank you, come again!&quot; The man had said in accented English before walking away.

Now, they were driving.

&quot;<strong>Told you it would work.</strong>&quot; Illyn leaned back in his chair as he ate half of a Futterbinger™️. &quot;People are far more willing to believe in anything if you put enough money in front of their face. So unprincipled.&quot;

The wind rushed through the open window, tousling his hair in each and every way possible. He had already devoured his own candy bar, and Illyn refused to dispense him more, even as he threw him the best puppy dog eyes he could muster.

So, Rider immersed himself in the next best thing: the journey itself. 

&#39;No complaints here!&#39; He declared, then shifted the car into a higher gear. The vehicle momentarily lurched as it adjusted to the change, then it shot forward, pressing Rider and Illyn back into their seat as they accelerated at a breakneck pace.

Rider laughed with pure joy. He swerved left and then quickly right, overtaking a car on the double lane road. A trail of dust kicked up in his wake, earning the Rider pair a barrage of angry shouts. His Riding skill, despite being at an average C rank, allowed him the luxury of handling the car like any skilled driver.

But now Rider was pushing beyond the skill&#39;s limits. With the audacity of an F-1 racer, he intended to extract every ounce of excitement from the car itself. All established norms of traffic regulations, lights, and signals became a mere afterthought as he propelled the car forward, clearing through anything in their path so long as there was an appropriately sized gap.

&#39;This is fun!&#39; Rider exclaimed as he leaned towards Illyn—perhaps a bit too far—almost obstructing the magus&#39; view of the road ahead. &#39;If only I can get my hands on another biscuit to make it even more fun!&#39;

Oh boy, still hadn&#39;t given up on that, had he?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118424785731453029 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118424785731453029><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 1:20 AM">1:20 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

No biscuits for you.</strong>&quot; Illyn said pointedly as he took a bite of the last biscuit from the bag. Now that he could taste food, each buttery bite made Illyn want to cheer and cry and laugh. Food was a necessity of life, but taste was a luxury of the living.

The passenger window was down, allowing Illyn&#39;s hair to flutter slightly in the wind. It made Rider&#39;s several crimes against the roads of Benerice hit far harder. Without a seatbelt, Rider would&#39;ve sent his Master flying out of the window when they had turned past Tendy&#39;s on 4th Street.

As Rider leaned towards Illyn—blocking both of their sights—Illyn manuevered his biscuit away from Rider&#39;s mouth. A sharp jerk of the wheel from Rider sent the biscuit flying out the window.

&quot;<strong>Bastard.</strong>&quot; Illyn snarled as the crumbly goodness became the food of whatever birds decided to peck at it. &quot;Eyes on the road!&quot; Illyn shoved his Servant back into the proper seat, and then produced IBM. What were biscuits but grain, butter, milk, and a few other trace ingredients? He had scanned one biscuit into IBM earlier, and it was time to print out as many as IBM&#39;s reserves would allow.

One.

Joy.

&quot;Splendid. What a fine aroma.&quot; Illyn took a deep breath as he took in the biscuit&#39;s scent. It was warm, as if it had just come out of the oven. 

Illyn leaned in to take a bite...

Easy for him to say!

Ever since Illyn had brought out the briefcase, Rider&#39;s attention had been completely diverted from the road. He made a show of staring straight ahead whenever Illyn shot him a disapproving glance, but as soon as the magus looked away, Roder couldn&#39;t resist stealing glances at him through the rearview mirror.

The tantalizing scent of freshly baked goods wafted from the briefcase. It was hard to believe that the same box contained dozens upon dozens of corpses too...but, well, at the end fo the day, sustenance was sustenance, interpreted one way or another. Edibles should be stored together, right?

Rider continued to drive, now relying more on his Rider&#39;s instincts to guide him along as his attention was split two ways. As Illyn reached inside the briefcase, he tilted his head ever so subtly...

A <em>single</em> biscuit?!

That lone biscuit had no right to emit such a powerful aroma! Was Illyn secretly hiding more biscuits and merely taunting him with a single piece?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">...Untruth. There is only one biscuit.</code>

Call it a hunch, but Rider dismissed that hypothesis at once. In that very moment, his eyes darkened, like that of a predatory animal ready to hunt. As Illyn&#39;s hand gravitated towards his mouth with the biscuit...

<em><strong>MUNCH!</strong></em>

Rider slammed on the gas pedal, while simultaneously jerking his head towards Illyn. He leaned down, and with a perfectly timed bite, snatched the biscuit from the magus&#39; grasp.

&#39;Score!&#39; He exclaimed, his words muffled by the mouthful of deliciousness. The thrill of successfully pilfering food from someone else was exhilarating, even if he already predicted the outcome would be in his favor. Nothing brought him greater joy than the act of food theft!

Rider buzzed with excitement. He was so thoroughly invigorated by his dirty deed that his entire form began to wobble...

Kalki&#39;s dominating presence had vanished. In his place—the driver&#39;s seat, that is—sat a rather petite figure. He(?) appeared to be young of age, noticeably taller than the kid Illyn had encountered at the Church, but clearly far below the legal driving age.

Rider glanced up at Illyn with a sheepish expression, though he still continued to munch on the biscuit without a care in the world. His attention was <em>definitely</em> not on the road anymore. This spelled terrible news for the magus: they were now hurtling towards the backside of a truck, and Rider didn&#39;t seem to have any intention of taking the wheel!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118611915200004097 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118611915200004097><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 14, 2023 1:44 PM">1:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Numbers were always rushing through his head. He knew how fast the wind was going, how quickly the truck ahead of them was going, and the exact internal structure of the car itself.

The issue with this is that Illyn was slow compared to a Servant. Rider could likely lap Benerice before Illyn drove through it. How was he going to quickly respond to a biscuit thief?

<em><strong>MUNCH!</strong></em>

Illyn&#39;s eyes fluttered open. The expression he gave Rider was one of apocalyptic proportions. There was a hallowed rule in society as a whole.

You didn&#39;t <strong>fuck</strong> with a man&#39;s biscuit.

If looks could kill, the biscuitnapper would already be dead on the side of the road. With Rider&#39;s future sight, it was <em>very</em> clear that the next few moments for he was going to be miserable.

Just, for the wrong reason.

&quot;<strong>...Eh?</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s eyes widened as his Servant began glitching out. Was his Servant returning to the Throne? Illyn checked his command spells to make sure that he hadn&#39;t actually ordered his Servant to kill himself. Nope, they were all there. &quot;Look, the biscuit thing isn&#39;t a big de—&quot;

When Illyn looked back up, Rider was gone, and replaced by a child.

&quot;<strong>Rider?</strong>&quot; Illyn muttered as he reached out to touch the fluffy hat that adorned the child&#39;s head. &quot;<strong>Yes, you are Rider. Everything checks out, but yet...</strong>&quot;

<em><strong>HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!</strong></em> The truck that Illyn noticed earlier rushed towards them as Rider abandoned the duties of their Class Container.

&quot;Drive.&quot; Illyn said calmly as Rider sheepishly munched on the stolen biscuit. &quot;<strong>DRIVE!</strong>&quot; Illyn screamed as he grabbed the steering wheel to veer them away from the truck.

It was quite challenging to dye Sri Kalki&#39;s Saint Graph in my own colors, what with him being a divine Servant and all. Consider it my growth spurt,&#39; they joked.

Of <em>course</em> they had the audacity to tell <em>Illyn</em> to relax, even though it was Rider who should be panicking right now! And on multiple fronts too: firstly, they had committed a criminal offense by stealing their Master&#39;s snack, and secondly, they had steered the car perilously close to disaster as it nearly collieded with the oncoming truck!

The car veered wildly as Illyn snapped back to his senses and wrestled with the steering wheel. They managed to swerve past the truck by a hair&#39;s breadth, careening straight into the adjacent lane, then the next...until they found themselves speeding in reverse on the new lane, with approaching vehicles now coming towards them head-on!

Rider quickly took over the steering wheel. It almost came up to their chin, and their head only rose slightly above the elevated dashboard. But surely that was fine, right? After all, Illyn had confirmed that his Servant was still unmistakably in the Rider class, meaning that they possessed the necessary Class Skill to navigate—

&#39;Oh l&#224; l&#224;...&#39;

Oh dear. What now?

Rider turned to Illyn, and stared at him with bright round eyes that sparkled with innocence as the car began to <em>decelerate</em> in the middle of the opposite lane. 

&#39;Well, it&#39;s about my feet,&#39; they evenly stated. &#39;I can&#39;t quite reach the gas.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119020769926717482 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119020769926717482><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 4:49 PM">4:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Due to their height defecit, Rider fit quite nicely. &quot;<strong>Stay.</strong>&quot; Illyn told his Servant like one did a dog.

The reserved magus was slowly but surely becoming more and more frazzled as Rider&#39;s antics continued. The biscuit crime? Heinous. Replacing his tall and powerful Indian deity with someone who could be safely tucked away on the top shelf? Awful. Stealing a Rider&#39;s Class Container and being <em>unable to reach the accelerator</em>? Atrocious.

By shoving Rider into the crawl space and grabbing the wheel himself, Illyn unknowingly did an excellent pendulum turn as he dodged oncoming cars.

Trajectory? Calculated.

Speed? Fast.

Moments until impact? Three.

&quot;Brake!&quot; Illyn nudged the fluffy hat lodged firmly in the vehicle&#39;s crawlspace. &quot;No, that&#39;s the accelerator! Brake!&quot; The car swerved to the side as they dodged another vehicle.

&quot;Hit the gas.&quot; Illyn ordered his Servant with another nudge.

And only because you asked nicely!&#39;

The oversized fluffy hat quivered, its multitude of feathers tickling Illyn&#39;s nose as the magus leaned in to take control of the steering wheel. Its plumage towered above Rider&#39;s head, the very tip of the tallest feather nearly grazing the ceiling. What kind of outlandish fashion trend was this?

At least it provided Illyn with a convenient stress-relief object to squeeze, especially when the traffic became more congested!

Meanwhile, Rider nestled quite snuggly in the legroom beneath the driver&#39;s seat. They seemed unfazed by this quick turn of events, finding entertainment in Illyn&#39;s commands. They operated the pedals like a musical instrument, effortlessly transitioning between acceleration and deceleration.

Every now and then, they made mistakes, making the car veer dangerously close to others on the road, and only narrowly avoid disaster by the skin of their teeth. Other times, their responses were impeccable, as they pressed down on the correct pedal with perfect timing and strength. It almost felt as if Rider was deliberately toying with the situation.

&#39;Where are we headed?&#39; The bobbing hat inquired, as if saying, <em>&#39;Not like I can see anyway!&#39;</em>

How dare they ask such a question, considering they had been the one behind the wheel until this point?!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119058959144321074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119058959144321074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 7:20 PM">7:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

No biscuits!&quot; Illyn hissed at the quivering hat as they dodged a bus.

The magus frowned in response to Rider&#39;s idiotic question. He <em>knew</em> where they were going, and yet he asked Illyn anyway. Was he being tested by this mysterious new Servant? He chuckled to himself. &#39;Mysterious&#39;. This Servant was anything but. Yet as Rider himself likely knew, Illyn loved tests. Even if this was some stupid joke, he&#39;d answer it.

&quot;You should know. You marked it on the map.&quot; Illyn frowned as he remembered Rider&#39;s childish scribble that covered an entire block of Benerice. Luckily for Illyn, he was intimately familiar with the city, and knew the store in question. &quot;We are almost there. Bra—&quot;

The car accelerated, resulting in Illyn and Rider almost rear-ending a oil tanker. Illyn dug his hands furiously into Rider&#39;s fluffy hat like a stress ball.

&quot;<strong>Achoo!</strong>&quot; Illyn sneezed as his prodding of Rider&#39;s fluffy hat agitated the feathers into brushing his nose.

After a few moments, he sneezed again. He glared at his Servant. He was far more outspoken with Rider now that his Servant had ditched the handsome guise of Kalki in exchange for a smaller, compact model.

In a sense, Illyn had done the same.

&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Illyn said as they turned into a parking lot. Illyn&#39;s eyes widened as he gazed upon the sign.

<strong>E</strong>MPORIUM OF <strong>A</strong>MAZING, <strong>G</strong>REAT, AND <strong>A</strong>WESOME <strong>N</strong>&#39;STUFF!

Several posters adorned the windows of the store:

Pallas Undies, 50% off! Acupuncture those prices by asking for the tourist discount! It&#39;s a dream come true! We&#39;re not clowning around!

Another, smaller sign said the following:

<strong>Closed For Rennovations Until...</strong> Several dates were crossed out with childish marker, until it finally said &quot;TO BE DETERMINED&quot; near the bottom of the poster.

Illyn&#39;s head hit the steering wheel with a dull <strong>thunk</strong>. After a moment, he looked up. &quot;<strong>I think we have the wrong place. Let&#39;s go home, Rider.</strong>&quot; Illyn sighed as he put the key into the ignition.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119098762179129374 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119098762179129374><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 15, 2023 9:58 PM">9:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The fluffy hat collided with Illyn&#39;s chin. Again. 

Rider emerged from the cramped space beneath the driver&#39;s seat, peering over the steering wheel as they expertly wedged themselves between Illyn and the controls. Somewhere in the process, Illyn noticed that the car key was missing from the ignition. Rider must have pocketed it while he was distracted...

&#39;What do you mean?&#39; The youthful Servant asked, their hand casually resting on the car door handle. &#39;You didn&#39;t misread my map. This is the right place!&#39; 

Before Illyn could protest or attempt to stuff Rider back under the seat, they pushed the door open and hopped out. Then they slipped their hands into Illyn&#39;s, and began to pull him along as well.

&#39;Come on, Mr. Mariston, don&#39;t be antisocial.&#39; Rider chided playfully. &#39;Don&#39;t you want to explore all the amazing, great, and awesome stuff this place has to offer?&#39;

Judging by the utter lack of enthusiasm in Illyn&#39;s eyes, the answer was most likely a resounding <em>no</em>. But Rider wasn&#39;t one to give up so easily!

&#39;Cigarettes,&#39; they said, as the Pallas undie poster flapped in the wind.

&#39;Biscuits,&#39; they added with clear ulterior motives.

&#39;The latest issue of Desert Racers, special Egyptian edition. They even have a section on camel racing. Doesn&#39;t that sound nice?&#39; Rider suggested sweetly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119357521187057826 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119357521187057826><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 3:07 PM">3:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Let&#39;s go, Rider.&quot; Illyn prepared to drive the duo home as Rider escaped his comfy prison and popped out onto the parking lot. A deep exhale left Illyn&#39;s nose as Rider goaded him into joining him.

Illyn, getting goaded by a child? 

Absurd. That would never happen.

And Rider knew it.

Yet Illyn still wanted biscuits, and he supposed that it was wise to gather as many resources into IBM as possible. His current reserves were low, and if this store was never open, nobody would be able to tell the difference.

Except the store owners themselves. If the store was closed for the duration of the Holy Grail War, then the true nature of this store and its owners was very clear. In that case, it was best to worsen the enemy&#39;s position while strengthening their own.

And biscuits.

Illyn sighed as he turned off the car and opened the door to follow Rider to the store&#39;s entrance. He jiggled the door, and it was locked. Sighing, he went back to his car and took a single, strange looking fry from the fast food bag Rider had pillaged.

Illyn carefully peeled the fry and tossed the excess into Rider&#39;s mouth as he babbled about Desert Racers. Illyn turned to see the magazine in the window. Oh, he <em>wanted</em> it. He loved that magazine.

&quot;It does, but don&#39;t talk to me like a child, boy-thing.&quot; Illyn&#39;s mouth curled into a frown as he worked. &quot;You can talk when you finally breach 160 centimeters.&quot;

The fry began to take shape. It looked like a strange, thin tool as Illyn molded it into the ideal shape. Then, he reinforced it. Illyn had created a lockpick out of a waffle-cut french fry.

Illyn inserted it into the keyhole, and a click was heard, and the door swung open. Illyn tossed the fry into his mouth, pleased with the work. Reinforced fries tasted <em>awful</em>.

&quot;Never thought I&#39;d lockpick like that, before.&quot; Illyn frowned. &quot;Shame that I lost my actual lockpicking kit in my <strong>old car</strong>.&quot;

Illyn&#39;s offhanded remark about their lockpicking tools had them smiling like a Cheshire cat. They shamelessly stretched their arms behind their hat, and yawned.

&#39;Still, it all worked out in the end, didn&#39;t it?&#39; Rider pointed out the irrefutable. &#39;If the result is good, who cares about the process?&#39;

As Illyn opened the door to the store, Rider took the opportunity to invite themselves in, this time using the door for its intended purpose and waltzing through the opening, instead of—

<em>Thud!</em>

They fell flat on their face, their extravagant and excessively long sleeves getting caught on the corner of the door. 

&#39;Oof. That&#39;s new.&#39; Rider rubbed their forehead, before clambering back on their feet.

Now that they were out in the open, Illyn finally had a chance to take a proper look at his Servant. The fluffy hat was only the tip of the iceberg; everything about Rider&#39;s appearance screamed antique, as if they had stepped out of a Rococo painting: elaborate, flamboyant, and undeniably...impractical. How anyone could move comfortably, let alone fight, in such frills, laces, and ornaments was a mystery to Illyn.

Rider seemed to take stock of their situation as well.

&#39;I suppose being a part of this world comes with its own inconveniences.&#39; They mumbled as they delved deeper into the store, leaving Illyn to browse and scan at his leisure.

A few minutes later, Rider emerged from the back of the store, clutching a pair of Pallas undies.

&#39;Ta-da!&#39; They exclaimed, flashing the large cat motif in Illyn&#39;s face like some sort of prized trophy. Their arms were laden with other articles of clothing as well—a white sundress, cheap sandals with towering five-inch platforms, almost as if they had taken Illyn&#39;s jab at their height to heart...and, of course, an outrageously large sunhat.

Yet one cannot doubt the process. It is proper to document your findings, create a hypothesis, and then make that hypothesis reality, or fail. You&#39;re aware of the scientific method, I presume.&quot; 

Illyn sighed as he pushed his flicked Rider&#39;s garb off the various instruments attempting to snag it.

&quot;That&#39;s why the Holy Grail War exists, after all. It allows the intellectually stunted to skip the process entirely. Since Servants lust after the Holy Grail, your disagreement is noted.&quot; Illyn&#39;s statement was casual, even as its hypocrisy bled through. He mocked chasing the Grail, yet he did it himself. Even if he originally wanted the Holy Grail for the Servant it provided, he was still fighting.

Or perhaps the Grail had given him a mark for a different reaosn entirely.

Illyn disliked Rider&#39;s attire, even as he commended it. Simplicity and efficiency was ideal, but even Illyn admired the floofiness of the garb. He swatted the garb away with a flick of the wrist. He entertained denying Rider&#39;s request, then shrugged.

IBM appeared on the ground with a clang, and opened up. &quot;Throw it in. I&#39;ll scan it so we can make more, should you wish.&quot; Leaving his Servant to his own devices, Illyn scoured the store, looking for a few items in particular. He skipped past valuable items he&#39;d normally snatch, instead heading to a small aisle meant for refridgerated ingredients.

Bright eyes flicked over the holy trinity:

Eggs.

Milk.

Flour.

&quot;<strong>Rider.</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s voiced grew urgent. &quot;<strong>Rider! Fetch me my briefcase. It&#39;s urgent!</strong>&quot;

The sight of the opened briefcase told Rider everything they needed to know. With a wide grin, the petite servant gave Illyn a tight hug, once again subjecting his face to the delightful sensation of being massaged by the world&#39;s softest feathers.

&#39;You&#39;re the best!&#39; Rider exclaimed, practically pouncing on top of IBM. At the same time, Illyn felt a dip in his mana reserves. &#39;I think we&#39;ll need <em>at least</em> four changes of clothing. Five, if we end up spending too much time at the Church...&#39;

Rider mused as they settled down beside IBM, allowing it to work its magic. They glanced around the store, then, catching sight of the mini TV set that still occupied the counter, bolted upright. The TV seemed to have been fixed since their last visit, and Rider suddenly had an urge to turn it on...

And so they did. An antenna shot up from the machine, then the screen flickered to life, displaying a rather staticky image.

&#39;Hehe.&#39; Rider leaned against the counter, resting their head in their arms as they gazed intimately at the TV screen. &#39;Poor things. Fighting over my leftovers.&#39;

They changed the channel to some cartoon showing boys playing soccer, filling the room with energetic shouts in Arabic. Rider entertained themselves by predicting the goals for each team for a while. When the credits rolled and the title <strong>&#39;CAPTAIN MAJID&#39;</strong> flashed across the screen, they swiftly switched to another channel.

The next program featured foreign news about a <strong>Noah&#39;s Ark project</strong> planned to launch by the turn of the century. For the first time, a frown appeared on Rider&#39;s face. 

&#39;Silly humans,&#39; they whispered, then their shoulders shook as they began to chuckle, silently. &#39;Why waste resources on something that won&#39;t ever be used...?&#39;

Before they could finish their thought, Illyn&#39;s voice resonated from the back of the store. Rider stood upright. They snapped IBM shut, and teetered as they hurriedly carried the briefcase to the frozen section of the store.

<strong>&#39;PANCAKES!&#39;</strong> They shouted enthusiastically. <strong>&#39;WAFFLES! CUSTARD! COOKIES!&#39;</strong> 

They practically flew into Illyn&#39;s arms, IBM held over their head, with the edge of the sunhat poking through.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 9:39 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119999727673540670 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119999727673540670><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 9:39 AM">9:39 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For someone to feel genuine excitement in something that <em>he</em> was capable of was a feeling Illyn rarely experienced. IBM was born of scorn and disdain, for a grand design. To use it for something like this...

Would Illyn Mariston even consider such a thing?

The thought barely shot through Illyn&#39;s mind before another room answered <em>&#39;No&#39;</em>.

Choking the thought down, Illyn exhaled and sighed. &quot;No, we can only make biscuits. It&#39;s the only edible food schematic I have in IBM. Empahsis on <em>edible</em>.&quot; Illyn flashed back to Rider&#39;s horrible drink. 

Cracking a few eggs into IBM, along with a bag of flour, some milk, and butter, Illyn leaned back and waited. Biscuits had a few other ingredients, but IBM should have materials needed to synthesize the buttery treat, given how much had been dumped into the device.

<strong>Ding!</strong> A biscuit shot out of IBM and hit Rider square on the fluffy hat. Another shot out and almost hit Illyn, if the magus hadn&#39;t been expecting it. When he knew that something was coming, it was fairly easy to grab it.

&quot;Good.&quot; Illyn bit into his biscuit. &quot;What was on the television? It&#39;s hard to keep up with the news when you&#39;re dead for a night.&quot;

Did he know what Rider saw, or was this Illyn making conversation with an all-knowing Servant?

Even his height seemed to shrink at the advent of this terrible news. &#39;Tsk-tsk, Mr. Mariston, that won&#39;t do. How would you please your spouse if biscuits are the only things you can make?&#39;

Though it was more about pleasing Rider themselves, to be honest. They clearly had more exciting culinary ideas in mind. All they needed was to introduce the briefcase to a wide array of <s>Rider&#39;s favorite</s> foods—

<em><strong>Ding!</strong></em>

&#39;Nom!&#39; Regardless, Rider opened their mouth and caught their share of the biscuit as it bounced off their hat. If only all children were this easy to please!

Rider fell silent for a moment as they munched on their treat. The store was no fine dining establishment, but sneaking snack between aisles as if they owned the place still had its charm. Rider&#39;s head bobbed in contentment as they leaned against an ice cream freezer, enjoying the coolness against their back while Illyn posed his question.

&#39;Soccer, then some boring old news.&#39; Rider said between mouthfuls. &#39;Gas explosion in the north, a haunted mansion in the east. We were just there! But we didn&#39;t make it to the news.&#39; They didn&#39;t sound too disappointed.

&#39;Then there&#39;s this fancy science project they&#39;re unwrapping at New Year&#39;s,&#39; Rider continued with a visible pout. &#39;Noah&#39;s Ark, they&#39;re calling it. Noah would be rolling in his grave if he knew his ship had been reduced to a silly little experiment like that.&#39;

Rider popped the remainder of the biscuit into their mouth. &#39;Did you know about it?&#39; They asked Illyn. &#39;You must have, right?&#39; They cast him a knowing look. &#39;Why didn&#39;t you go back and tell them to scrap it?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120429689182371940 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120429689182371940><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 19, 2023 2:07 PM">2:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That is your <strong>only</strong> warning.&quot;

If he didn&#39;t defend Evi&#39;s name, after she had passed into dust, who else would. Besides, he felt obligated to. It seemed that even as he became more human, his obsession with her faltered as memories were recovered. He remembered her face. Her hair. Her smell. What she liked to eat. Now that he had something to work with, he felt far less desperate to cling to what little he had.

Yet he was Illyn, and so a quota must be filled.

&quot;Yes, yes. Quite a lot of gas explosions. My fireflies keep me informed. Lots of Servants running around. More than seven, by my count.&quot; When Rider mentioned Noah&#39;s Ark, Illyn&#39;s face grew thoughtful. He looked at his Servant and shrugged.

&quot;<strong>Do you honestly think I could convince the Six Sources, or Atlas, to do anything</strong>?&quot; Illyn sighed and leaned back. &quot;Everybody had pet projects in Atlas, that just happened to be the largest one. It&#39;s a waste of materials and effort, but it keeps them distracted from making another world-ender. I lived in a little box that included my wife and little else. Noah&#39;s Ark did not fit inside.&quot;

Illyn bit into his biscuit.

&quot;There is a better question: <strong>why didn&#39;t you?</strong>&quot;

Without another word, they slid down against the freezer and hugged their legs. The large, cyan hat almost completely covered their petite form like a turtle shell. It looked perfectly round from the top, the feathers encircling it like mini orbital rings.

&#39;I had one job,&#39; Rider said quietly. &#39;Making suggestions was never a part of it. They were interested in what I knew, but not really what I wanted...&#39;

&#39;But I don&#39;t blame them.&#39;

The fluffy hat shook.

&#39;I won&#39;t blame them, because if I had more knowledge than I could possibly process in a limited lifetime, I, too, would focus on the acquisition rather than figuring out what to do with all of it.&#39;

Piece by piece, Rider retrieved their chosen outfit from IBM, unfolding them on their lap. They lifted the dress and studied their reflection in the freezer&#39;s glass, a small grin beginning to form on their lips once again.

&#39;Now, though,&#39; they declared. &#39;I think I can finally do something about it.&#39; Rider playfully poked Illyn&#39;s reflection in the freezer as well. &#39;That includes you, them, and everyone else. Making a difference. That has quite the nice ring to it, I think!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121003403808620596 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121003403808620596><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 4:07 AM">4:07 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

After a moment, he ruffled the Servant&#39;s hat. The motion was stiff and mechanical, yet strangely fluid at the same time. It was a human expression, done by a human, but it was done by someone who had no experience in the art of comforting something small.

&quot;Nothing. The very same as me. It must seem so... <em>simple</em> from our differing perspectives on one another. Just, go out and accomplish something spectacular with our capabilities as all-knowing concepts or as physical beings. Just as nobody listens to your insight as a intangential being, I alone cannot change the tides of Noah&#39;s Ark. I would not be surprised if some small piece of my work ended up on Noah&#39;s Ark.&quot;

Slowly but surely, the biscuit disappeared as bite-sized chunks were taken out of it. After a moment, he exhaled. No matter what Rider said, the two of them had made differences. Minor differences in the grand patchwork of the universe, but they had made changes.   
How many families would remain incomplete because of Illyn? How many things that should&#39;ve remained unsolved were solved thanks to Rider?

It went down and down.

&quot;I will help you.&quot; Illyn said simply. &quot;Because I think Evi would like me to make a postive change in the world. I will never be good. I should—will continue to strive to bring her back. It is engrained into me. It is a directive I <em>must</em> follow. If I can be your guide, I will be.&quot;

Illyn leaned close to Rider&#39;s ear. &quot;<em>Here&#39;s your first lesson, Rider...</em>&quot;

&quot;<strong>You just confirmed your identity to me. Thank you, &#39;Sri Kalki&#39;</strong>.&quot; 

With that, Illyn produced a knife with a slice of butter on it. &quot;Would you like another biscuit?&quot;

I just wasn&#39;t one-hundred percent certain how you would react to knowing...until now, that is.&#39;

They nodded enthusiastically as Illyn offered another biscuit. &#39;There&#39;s so much I still don&#39;t know about this world,&#39; Rider admitted as they watched the magus generously slather the biscuit with butter. &#39;I knew what a biscuit <em>should</em> taste like, but it wasn&#39;t until I actually tried one that I fell in love with it. The same goes for cake pops, french fries, chicken sandwiches...&#39; They listed an array of foods on their fingers. &#39;That&#39;s what you call an experiment, right? <strong>He</strong> mentioned something similar when I came into existence.&#39;

The butter was practically dripping off the biscuit now, but Rider didn&#39;t say stop. Was there even such a thing as <em>too much</em> butter, anyway?

&#39;The end of the century is rapidly approaching. While you may miss this year&#39;s fireworks, perhaps you&#39;ll be able to witness the sunrise with Evi next year. I also have a lesson for you, Illyn...&#39;

Rider rested their head on their hands and looked at Illyn with an owlish gaze. &#39;With me by your side, you don&#39;t need something like the Holy Grail. Whether it&#39;s one wish, two wishes, or a hundred wishes, I can fulfill them all.&#39;

The words sounded too good to be true, but Rider looked serious for once. &#39;Not as an act of God,&#39; they wagged their finger. &#39;But as the culmination of a grand experiment that cannot fail.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 11:26 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122562468061909003 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122562468061909003><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 11:22 AM">11:22 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He blinked a few times, before stopping the butter flow on his own. After a few moments, he regained composure.

&quot;Theory is important and understanding is imperative, but the practical application is always important. Programs... are complicated.&quot; Illyn trailed off. Recreating Evi with memories was difficult without an actual base. Just as how understanding food was different from tasting it, memories of Evi were different from the genuine article.

Yet he would keep trying.

&quot;He?&quot; Illyn leaned forward. &quot;How is that possible? The Grail is a child&#39;s toy, this is known. Yet to recreate its power a thousand times over... You would need to cheat laws that govern magical energy. Basic laws of thermodynamics would need to be bent. Is that truly possible?&quot;

Was there even a source of energy that could start such an awe-inspiring event? Of course there was. A Holy Grail.

&quot;Ah... Is that why so many Servants have been summoned?&quot; Illyn&#39;s eyes fluttered. He stood up. &quot;It is not relevant at this precise moment. Strip the store. Take everything. Leave no fingerprints.&quot; 

The urge to shoplift was enticing when you had the ability to steal as much as a metaphysical pocket dimension could hold. That was to say, a <strong>lot</strong>.

Rider dogged Illyn&#39;s steps. Perhaps it <em>had</em> been fate that allowed such a wonderful device to manifest where Rider had resided for most of their life. However, every fiber of their being rejected that hypothesis.

No, it was simply a matter of likelihoods. Many Holy Grails had manifested throughout history, and they would continue to manifest in the future. It just so happened that, at this particular moment, a Grail containing an abnormally large amount of magical energy had appeared right at their doorstep.

&#39;Can Servants even leave fingerprints?&#39; Rider raised both hands in a claw like gesture as they advanced towards the snacks section. If they simply took <em>everything</em> they touched...then surely there would be no need to worry about the evidence, right?

But, as time passed, it became evident that Rider&#39;s resolve had waned.

He had originally held several metric tons of material within IBM before losing it.

Then he went to Albania for a few months. Illyn shuddered. What had happened in Albania would stay in Albania until the day the world ended.

&quot;And,&quot; Illyn&#39;s tone implied that his next phrase was going to be one of scolding, &quot;the easiest way to be caught is to be lax. Just because you&#39;re aware of how things work does not mean you get to slack off. Shame on you.&quot; 

Illyn thwacked Rider on the head and took a box of cupcakes out of his hand, before tossing them into IBM. &quot;Work!&quot; Illyn barked. 

Benerice&#39;s Holy Grail War was certainly unique. Even across a hundred different worlds and timelines, Illyn struggled to imagine a Holy Grail War that threw the concept of <strong>seven</strong> classes on its head.

Where had that magical energy come from? How had it manifested as a Grail? Why was Atlas so lax about it? There were many questions, and many were unlikely to be answered by Illyn running mental simulations.

After a while, Illyn had stripped the store bare of useful materials, while Rider slowly slacked off and allowed themselves to be distracted by other things. 

Rider really <em>was</em> a lazy genius. It was moments like this that made Illyn miss Kalki. At least Kalki&#39;s words were backed by actions. Plus, his cooking was way better.
