It was initially going to be a simple task. Go outside. Find the trail. Follow said trail. Find the kid. Finish the job. Five easy steps. But nothing is really that easy, huh?

&quot;Look! There&#39;s another one!&quot; 

&quot;This one is bleeding too!&quot; 

&quot;Is he okay?&quot;

&quot;What do you think is going on?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t hear any sirens. I don&#39;t think anything&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Should we call someone?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;What if they are shooting a film!&quot;

Of course it had to be crowded! There was so many people crowding the streets. All of them were either curious, concerned, or scared. For good reason! There was a bleeding man staggering down the streets who appeared to be followed the previous bleeding younger man before him.

That wasn&#39;t the worst part about this scenario either; it was the fact that there was so many eyes he had to avoid eye contact with.

There was no mental strength left inside of him to endure another trip into that Dreamscape. It was fortunate that all he needed to do to follow the trail was to stare down at the ground, well away from any watching eyes.

The only thing that kept James on the trail was the fact that he knew that he stabbed into Lachlan&#39;s thigh close to the start of their engagement. That and the last Nail he impaled him with gave him enough confidence that he couldn&#39;t have gotten far before giving up and resting. 

Sure, he was weaponless now but the man was too stubborn to just give up and call it quits at this point. Not while he is so close like this.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119975649411616881 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119975649411616881><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 8:03 AM">8:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He realized that the movies had all been wrong: when you break a fall via a slew of objects like poles, canopies, laundry ropes, and the like, you don&#39;t bounce back immediately after landing, ready for another round of daring feats. No. You either lay there for a good long while, preferably conscious...or you bloody well <em>crawl</em>.

Lachlan crawled. In times like this, Reinforcement Magecraft could only do so much. When he hit the ground, it felt as if his internal organs had all decided to rearrange themselves. The Dancer wasn&#39;t there to shield him, nor was Leapfrog available to cushion his fall. The former remained inside the hotel, while the latter...

He groaned as he crawled onward, one of his legs scraping uselessly across the ground.

<em>I have to get to the Workshop,</em> he thought.

He pulled himself forward, one hand red and dripping with blood.

The only thing he could do now was to keep casting <strong>Healing</strong> and <strong>Reinforcement</strong> spell over and over, concentrating them on the places that hurt the most. It was only when the pain began to subside that he grew worried—numbness was not a positive sign.

<em>Just one more step,</em> he repeated to himself. <em>Focus on the next step.</em>

Eventually, he managed to drag himself into an alley. It was completely deserted—not that he cared about attracting public attention at this point; he had long stopped taking stock of his surroundings. Feeling somewhat stable, he attempted to sit, leaning his back against the wall and hiding himself behind some potted plants. It was only then that he began to assess his wounds.

One Nail in the thigh. The wound had stopped bleeding, so he left it alone for now.

This one was still warm, and the flesh surrounding it had been completely <em>charred</em>. The wound sizzled and cracked, but no blood flowed. The cauterization caused by the Nail had sealed the would, providing an unexpected relief. With a grunt, Lachlan used his good hand to extract the needle and pocket it in his sleeve.

He glanced around; didn&#39;t recognize the streets, mind too jumbled even if the scenery did seem familiar. But then again, they were in the middle of a desert, everywhere looked familiar. How far was he from his Workshop? Lachlan shook his head—a wave of dizziness hit him, and he had to dip his head to focus on the ground.

God, there was so much blood. It stained everything, leaving streaks on the ground that eventually turned into footprints. Someone would find him, maybe Roland—

&#39;No.&#39; The puppeteer hugged himself, his voice hurt and brittle. &#39;Never...again.&#39;

The useless twerp had <em>deserted</em> him. He knew something was amiss when Roland fell silent after releasing the Dancer. The least he could do was offer assistance, be a human shield, but where was he when Lachlan needed him the most? Why was James present when Roland wasn&#39;t? He had fled the moment things went awry!

And left him to die.

Lachlan laughed in spite of himself. So this was how much that obedience was worth. Roland must not have been desperate enough. Perhaps he had already found a backup plan... perhaps he had already...

A dark thought crept into his mind.

The Command Seals tingled on the back of his neck. In that moment, Lachlan contemplated using them up. One stroke to make sure that Roland never saw the light of day again, and another to...

<em>Don&#39;t lose sight of your goal.</em>

Lachlan bit his tongue to stay awake. He channeled more mana through his circuits. <em>Just one more healing spell...come on, get up. Now. Hurry!</em>

That did nothing to deter the crowds to go away, though. They still gathered and gawked ever so curiously. There was nothing he could do to send them away without causing more of a commotion, and thus more attention. The best thing he could do is hope they lose interest on their own. Which was an unlikely dream scenario if he was being honest but it was all he had.

&quot;Just ignore them. Just ignore them...&quot; James whispered that mantra as he hobbled on. His voice barely audible to anyone besides himself. Repeated Healing spells on the stab wound in his side kept it in check, even if his circuits burned from constant use. The pain was a reminder to stay awake and focused. 

The alleyway provided a nice and calm break of the insanity that was their encounter in his room. A place where one could finally just <em>breathe</em>. Further down the alleyway in the direction Lachlan stared down was a cat resting on top of a few boxes. Their face was serene as they enjoyed a nice catnap. It looked like Lachlan wasn&#39;t the only one who found this place to be a great spot to rest up.

The cat&#39;s peace wasn&#39;t meant to last, neither was Lachlan&#39;s.

A loud crash spooked it awake. After a hiss, it bolted into the alleyway away from the noise. The source of the peace-disturbing noise? It was James stumbling into a garbage can once he found the same alleyway. 

&quot;Goddamnit...&quot; A quiet curse was made before he used the same garbage can to stand. There, while he was getting up, he saw the kid again. He looked like shit. Well, they both did. &quot;Stop making yourself suffer anymore than you need to, alright? Just. Let. This. End.&quot; James forced himself to stand and weakly step his way towards Lachlan. 

His free hand was not-so-subtly held in a way like he possessed a weapon already. No need to hide his cards anymore, though. Just like how Lachlan escaped using a <strong>Projection spell</strong>, it was going to be that very same spell which will materialize the weapon to end his life with.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120858290268672061 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120858290268672061><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 6:30 PM">6:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

James waited for him to move, but he did not. Truth was, his legs simply refused to work anymore. Guts and rage could only carry him so far, and right now, his body decided that every ounce of energy was to be spent prioritizing the preservation of its vital organs.

So, the strength in his legs would have to go.

James&#39; threat elicited a chuckle from him, which quickly turned into a grimace. &#39;Then stop following me like a god damned ghost,&#39; he spat. &#39;What are you, the paparazzi? Do you want me to sign you an autograph?!&#39;

A smirk twisted his lips. &#39;I don&#39;t do well with improv. Why don&#39;t you come up here and teach me the script? I&#39;ll even give you a satisfying scream, just the way you want it.&#39;

The struggle at the hotel had already done a number on them, never mind the impromptu chase throughout the city that had attracted the unneeded cries and glares of tourists and passerby. It was &#39;easy&#39; to play it off as two drunk friends pulling a prank on each other, but eventually someone would notice the blood. The injuries. The overwhelming urge to kill.

They stood at a standstill, wondering who would remain standing at the end. The alleyway had no exit, none that was easily accessible at the very least. This would be their last chance to settle things-

&quot;Get outta the way! Can&#39;t ya see a goddamn cart is running through?!&quot;

Cries returned across the street, though it didn&#39;t sound like it was people screaming at them. Something chaotic was happening in the background, much to James&#39; displeasure. Just when he had gotten used to ignoring the crowd, it came back in full force-

Wait, was that-?

There was no doubt about it. Despite her tattered clothes, his own Servant would stick out on any sort of canvas. He couldn&#39;t believe it, but right there, in the market streets, a cart was being dragged with Assassin in it. Dragged by a large fellow clad in black, with a getup that reminded him of old Westerns.

&quot;Just a bit till the hotel. Yer still alive, right? I paid you, so ya better not die on me yet!&quot; Bill stated, glancing back to Triboulet. Perhaps it was fate for him to do so right when he was about to cross the alley. Instead of heading towards the hotel, like he had planned, he instead stumbled across the man of the hour. To be more accurate, it was two of them.

<strong>&quot;FUCK.&quot;</strong> Bill immediately cursed, far too taken aback with what he saw. He didn&#39;t know how, but he had found his Master stuck in an alleyway, being corned by another man that he did not know of. Was that Triboulet&#39;s Master?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 4, 2023 2:36 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1125871815500251136 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1125871815500251136><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 4, 2023 2:32 PM">2:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He didn&#39;t bother asking. If she really cared, she&#39;d yap in his ear about it anyway. Especially after he took out his gun and took aim.

<em>BANG!</em>

It didn&#39;t show, but it was a warning shot. A warning shot directed to the more suspicious arm, which James planned on using his Projection magic on.

Triboulet just wanted her Master alive, right? A finger or two being gone was fine then, right?

A completely defenceless opponent sat down before him. An easy target. Light manifested in his hand before a knife formed. However, something prevented James from taking that next step.

<em>A Servant</em>. 

The telltale aura of a Servant was fast approaching! Did he run out of time? Just how was he going to escape? He needed to make this quick! He needed t-

Wait, Assassin? 

A glance back out of the alleyway to where the commotion was happening allowed him to see Assassin in a cart with what was another Servant dragging the cart along. No way anyone would be sane enough to wear that kind of getup on purpose, after all. Subtlety was something most Servants forgot to take into account with their outfits it would seem.

The gun that was raised against him sobered James up and out of his dazed stupor from trying to make sense of what he was looking at. James stumbled back and away from Lachlan, hoping to use something in the alleyway as cover. Fortunately, James wasn&#39;t the main target; his weapon was.

The bullet collided with the dagger he materialized, shattering it to pieces as it dissipated into the air into nothingness. The stumble back saved him his fingers. It left him one hell of a shaky hand, though. The recoil and impact was still felt up his arm. Although, he was now on his ass and all the strength in his legs wasn&#39;t enough to stand back up. He was finished.

A knowing glance was made towards Lachlan, making sure to avoid his eyes, to show that this was checkmate. Even with his own Servant here, another shot was all that Lachlan&#39;s Servant needed. <em>Lachlan won</em>.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126275222744596550 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126275222744596550><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 5:15 PM">5:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In preparation for what was sure to be a confusing and poorly communicated encounter, she had welled up what energy she had left within her.  She was weak, but Bill was no slouch, and the modern firearm was a terrifyingly strong weapon - the alcohol barely staunched the pain that remained in her shoulder.  It was a testament to herself that she remained conscious yet.

Now, when they were all but there, she had this planned out.  James was going to have to get pulled away from the Master as soon as possible, and if she wanted to keep Bill off her back, it was going to be done bloodlessly.  Disengagement was possible, but getting comedy out of the proceedings while wounded and incapacitated was going to be a rough spot - she&#39;d find a way, and--

and Bill just shot him WHAT IN GOD&#39;S NAME ARE YOU THINKING

It wasn&#39;t more than a second after they had come into the scene that Bill had let loose, and Triboulet didn&#39;t give him another second.  Her knife arced upward from the cart as a silver crescent, and it clashed with sparks as it rammed into the barrel of his gun.  It wasn&#39;t even enough to throw it off to the side, only throw his arm and aim off...and leave a noticeable notch in its body.

Was this a missed attack, a breach of ceasefire?  Or, was this her simply trying to lash out in the least lethal way, and tell him off in ways that words couldn&#39;t?  Bill&#39;s interpretation of events here would most likely spell life or death.

Triboulet didn&#39;t attack a second time, only hopping off the cart and running to her Master&#39;s side.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126632815757373490 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126632815757373490><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 6, 2023 4:56 PM">4:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>From Lachlan&#39;s perspective, this was undoubtedly a Servant.  It was making no attempt at hiding its nature...but at the same time, it certainly seemed like it wasn&#39;t much of one.  She barely ran at the same speed he could pull off if urged, and her movements were uncoordinated, haphazard.  Something, or someone, or somebill had hurt her badly, her right shoulder stained thoroughly red, but was that an excuse?  Hell, if he wanted, he could chase after the disarmed Mr. Rellum and he could&#39;ve probably caught up with him just as his Servant did.

It doesn&#39;t mean much in the grand scheme of things, as approaching one of these, even at their lowest, was suicide.  Just looking at her in comparison, though, Bill <em>definitely</em> didn&#39;t seem quite as shitty as before.  Little silver linings.

Triboulet&#39;s own estimation of Lachlan was brief, as other concerns were present, but she had a good idea about him: he was young, and his hair looked stupid.  All else escaped her in her haze of pain and beer.  At least she had Bill&#39;s word to go on, though.  She grit her teeth, and her words were as venomous as her gaze: &quot;You go home, Lockly!  Go home, shave your ragged scalp bald, and join a monastery!&quot;

She knelt by James&#39; side - her expression didn&#39;t hold up much, as he was in terrible shape just looking at him - and concluded with &quot;Maybe 50 years from now, they&#39;ll have turned you into a man instead of a big, shitty, upstart, ugly <em>child!&quot;</em>

Her words were scattershot and she wasn&#39;t in good sorts to come up with something better.  The only thing keeping Lachlan from sealing the deal was the knife pointed in his direction.  It was still red with blood...it could&#39;ve been anyone&#39;s, but maybe she had managed to get Bill good?  Then why were these riding together on a food cart?

What a shitty day...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Assassin&#39;s words got a laugh out of Lachlan, though his chest barely rose with the effort. There was little bite to his voice, as doing so would take more effort than he could spare. But the spark in his eyes never left.

It took him little time to unfold the new scene before him. Starting with the gunshot, the yelling, and now a knife pointed in his direction instead of James&#39; sharp needles. A new Servant had arrived, clearly partial to the Mystic Eye user and undoubtedly serving under him. But why hadn&#39;t she made her presence known until now? Was she an Assassin, or simply a scatterbrain? 

And speaking of scatterbrains...

&#39;Took you long enough,&#39; Lachlan murmured as he turned his head towards Bill, crimson coat billowing as they blocked the entrance of the alleyway. It was hard to tell what state the Archer was in due to their black and red attire. There were also many questions he wanted to ask regarding Bill&#39;s &#39;timely&#39; arrival with the other Servant. However, those could all wait, because—

&#39;The enemy Master,&#39; he signaled with a nod of his head towards James, who was barely shielded behind Assassin&#39;s diminutive figure. &#39;Shoot him down.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, July 8, 2023 5:17 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127361310938636488 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127361310938636488><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 8, 2023 5:11 PM">5:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill felt a slap on the wrist from the force of Triboulet&#39;s life, nearly knocking his gun out with pinpoint precision. Instead, all that remained was a tingling feeling as the man seethed at the deep and visible scar on his gun. Nothing serious and hardly worth concerning about, but insulting to one&#39;s pride.

Under normal circumstances, he would shoot anyone who dared do this around twenty or so times. These were not normal circumstances.

After all, he had just arrived to what appeared to be the end of a struggle: Triboulet&#39;s terrible suggestion for Lachlan to shave his head caused Bill to take a good look at his Master. They had seen far better days. Even the time back at the graveyard was not comparable. How long had he been fighting? How much had he endured against the enemy Master?

It was downright impressive how the Dowling still maintained his composure despite those injuries, keeping up a class act as he talked down to James and berated Bill for his tardiness. Orders followed suit immediately, and perhaps Lachlan truly was a king, because Bill almost felt compelled to raise his gun and follow along. Almost.

Instead, he tried his best to ignore the nick on his pistol and pointed it towards James, not uttering a word. Triboulet would feel shivers run down her back. That killing instinct she felt back then had started to return. Was she a true fool? Had she let herself be led astray, only to be gutted like a pig?

<em>&quot;Shoot him down.&quot;</em> Those words repeated. Easy as pie. Just a pull of the trigger-

&quot;Me Master is dying.&quot; Bill spat out. &quot;No point in killing slime like youse two if he dies in the crossfire.&quot; Archer narrowed his eyes, coming up with a convincing excuse. &quot;Tell you what: If ya can run past that lamp post over there in less than 10 seconds, I&#39;ll let ya go. You and that stupid Assassin of yours.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128040286967304302 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128040286967304302><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 2:09 PM">2:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
There were many things that people said in an attempt to trigger Lachlan. Insults, displays of power, mockeries and underhanded tactics. He was used to them all, thanks to his rich upbringing and plenty of life experience. It became so habitual that it had turned into a boor.

But nothing could replace the <em>anger</em> of a disobedient puppet. A hollow husk designed to be controlled that rejected its master&#39;s commands? Absolutely <em>worthless.</em>

A Servant disobeying you multiplied that pain <em>tenfold.</em>

&quot;Don&#39;t take this as charity though: I don&#39;t want to see yer faces ever again. Because if ya do have the audacity to come after us after all of this-&quot; Bill gestured around, widening his arms before closing them in.

&quot;Then it doesn&#39;t matter if my Master is dead or not. <strong>You&#39;re dead.</strong> No matter what, <em>I&#39;ll find you</em>. And I&#39;ll teach you what happens when ya take my goodwill for granted.&quot; Archer sneered. &quot;Now <strong>GO!</strong> Or Lord have mercy, there&#39;ll be four corpses lying around today.&quot;

What ever happened to hitting it big? What happened to sharing a common goal of stealing the Grail? Eliminating the competition? Reducing the pawns on the chessboard?

<em>All a load of bull crap.</em>

Bill had his own reasons to hide his intent. He would rather keep the agreement hidden between Assassin and himself for now, since Lachlan was in no state of understanding what had happened between the two. In his eyes, he was doing this for his Master&#39;s good. Keeping cards close to their chest. Lachlan was a smart kid. He would understand in due time!

...Would he really, though?

Triboulet&#39;s arm tensed, and her eyes twitched between the eyes of Lachlan and the hidden face of Bill.  She had an agreement, but with his Master right there, would Bill keep it?  It was almost understandable - they were long enough into the war that others had already passed, and to throw out cease-fires trivially didn&#39;t have the same weight.

His gun was trained on James.  Right between the eyes, from the trajectory she could plot.  His words backed up his threat of violence.

Could she trust him?

If things came down to it, it would be suicidal, and uncertain...but this knife of hers, it could go right into Lachlan&#39;s neck from here.  Whether her arm could flick faster than his trigger finger could pull...whether she could aim true, her nerves shot and her mind frayed...

You could ask Bill.  He&#39;d say he&#39;s a treacherous dog, and that trusting him is like trusting a snake.  They&#39;ll always bite you when their backs are turned.  He&#39;d insist on that, but...if he wanted her dead, she was already half-dead before, and letting her live has only put his Master in danger.

Was that his game?  To set her up and let her watch James die instantly?  For just a split second of despair on her part before she also went.

...Bill was a violent man, but she didn&#39;t see in him a <em>cruel</em> man.  He shot and killed those who wronged him, not tortured, violated.  That was the truth, right?

Her action, or inaction, predicated on her own judge of his character, a man she had met a couple of hours prior.  She could just take the initiative if she didn&#39;t trust him - kill Lachlan on the spot, take his surprise as an advantage and make sure that everything ended fair between them.

...Triboulet did not take that option.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128148675969957969 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128148675969957969><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 9:20 PM">9:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>When Bill offered them a reprieve, it took her masterful acting to not take a deep exhale of relief - she was an enemy of Archer.  She didn&#39;t have any reason to see this coming, and she had to act surprised.  She did so, her knife pointing downward as her conviction faltered, letting Bill run his mouth.

...though, there was something that did sting a little.  That bit about never seeing him again...sounded more genuine, in her head.  Unless he died off on his own, which wasn&#39;t unthinkable, they&#39;d meet again with knives out.  

A shame.  That time they spent together was unique, and...wait, no, he was an annoying bastard.  Why would she ever care about that?  Next time, all she&#39;d have to do is remember him, and his dull mind, and his idiotic words, and his <em>bullshit pie spam,</em> and that&#39;d be that.

Yeah.

When beckoned upward, James felt his whole body jerk upward suddenly.  Triboulet was pulling him along, because whatever solace she had, she had growing concern for his own state.  She pointed her knife back at Bill and shouted &quot;Fucking DOG!  Understimating me like this!  Next time, I&#39;ll feed you your Master&#39;s damn guts - better food for you than the shit on the street you&#39;re so fond of!&quot; as she hobbled over.

Unless James simply expired then and there, she&#39;d get past that lamp post with a second remaining.  Her paranoia continued to yell at her, but she kept it from clouding her mind.

See ya, Bill.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
