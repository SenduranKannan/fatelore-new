It was located on the less privileged side of Berenice, crammed into space too small for the myriad of other buildings of its kind, the tight alleys falling into disrepair and neglect as there was neither space nor care for their maintenance. The stench of accumulated litter could thus become quite unpleasant at times, though thankfully the constant ruffling breeze sweeping in from the Nile had for the most part kept the smell at bay, now only surfacing in the stale backstreets where the winds could not reach.
Still.
This quarter was home of a thriving community, restaurants and vibrant shops competing for customers, the occasional screeching of excited children cutting through the air as they raced past the crowds.

It was here that Ann and Prince had settled down after their loss against Charlotte and her and Archer Philoctetes.

It was a purchase of convenience, simply the first building they had come across as they dragged their tired battered bodies back into civilization, but most importantly, it had just lost its last occupants. The rumors of the ongoing escalating murders had apparently driven the previous tourists renting it out, deciding that their party holiday was not quite worth the risk of indiscriminate butchery, and so the landlord was quite receptive when confronted with the suspicious pair’s straight-forward offer.

One was a woman who looked like she had just wrestled a crocodile, and the girl who accompanied her was stark naked, covered in nothing more than a ragged blanket. The implication of their relationship was anything but favorable, age difference notwithstanding, but he was quickly given a reason to stop caring.
First the pale white girl tried to hand him archaic gold coins and jewelry, each clearly valuable enough to outright buy the property to begin with, but after some exasperated scolding and whispers from her wild companion, she eventually handed over an equal amount of Egyptian Pounds.

Not a bad deal to buy his silence and exclusive access to the house for the next few weeks. One he accepted on the spot.
Booking himself a room at the Sofitel Legend Old Cataract Aswan the very same day, the most expensive hotel in the area, he decided to enjoy his early retirement.

“Even so, I did not expect to be ‘alone’ alone…” Prince mumbled to himself as he pruned a shriveled flower.

Hedges that scaled the sun-dried walls, vines lovingly coiled around the trees and pillars, and roses of purest white which practically glowed in the light of the burning sun, their sweet fragrance luring one deeper into the comforting shade of the inner sanctum. It was a magnificent garden, magically grown and meticulously maintained by none other than Prince, a place he would escape to for the better parts of the day to keep himself busy… to keep himself from having to think about the inevitability of the looming War he had been summoned into.
Pissed off by his cowardly and reluctant attitude, Ann eventually got sick of him and likewise found a place to vent her frustrations, that being a local bar at which a growing tab had since been opened under his name.

Such was the state of their currently ongoing cold war, with neither side budging or willing to concede.

It was uncomfortable. It was awkward. It was painful.
Deprived of human contact for who knows how long, and this is what he got after finally returning to this form!? Was this a targeted psychological attack by his Master to actually get him to participate in the War? No. That couldn’t be it, but still, if things were going to continue like this, then he would rather leave and settle down as far away from her as possible, but-

It was early, not even quite evening yet with the sun’s descent barely even felt, but then again, Ann had left for her favorite spot even earlier than that. As newly elected guest of honor, it wasn’t like she would be denied entry or service, and though he had initially elected to pay her tab as a means of keeping her drunk and happy, he wasn’t quite sure if this was the best decision to make in hindsight.

And so he headed out, leaving their home unattended. Not like either of them cared if it was broken into anyway.

Having since learned a bit more of this era’s fashion, Prince had initially elected to dress himself as befit his royal status… until he passed out from a heatstroke not soon after and had to be nursed back to health by being unceremoniously dumped in the Nile by a certain someone to cool him down. Ever since he had dressed lightly, perhaps too lightly, in nothing more than a thin white shirt and black shorts, his unkempt hair restrained by a clear blue ribbon, and his feet clad in open sandals.

Fortunately the pub was not far, so there was no real sense of danger as the barkeep had made it his mission to keep an eye out for his two new favorite customers, and placing his had on the door, Prince took a deep slow breath, preparing his mind for his Master that no doubt waited on the other side, unaware of his coming.

Wiping the sweat from his forehead and shaking it clean, he opened the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While Ann found Lindwyrm cool and strong, she was far from blind to his many, <em>many</em> flaws. She was so aware of them that she sometimes wondered if she&#39;d been on the unlucky side of the Servant lottery, and even found herself fantasising about how things might have turned out if she&#39;d summoned a more... standard Servant. Or at least one who didn&#39;t take the slightest opportunity to try and eat her whole.

And yet, now that Prince had replaced him, she was internally <em>begging</em> for things to go back to the way they were before. They said you never really understood the importance of things until you lost them. How right they were. Between a huge, free-spirited, bloodthirsty dragon who followed her every word... and a tiny, cowardly, self-conscious wimp who could barely open a jam jar without outside help? The choice was easy for her.

But the wimp could at least make money appear out of thin air. Money couldn&#39;t buy her the Holy Grail, but it could buy her a decent home and unlimited drinks in a bar. And as it turned out, she hadn&#39;t realised how much she needed those two things until she had them. That was definitely something he had over Lindwyrm.

The alcohol washed away the weight of her battles and the heaviness that plagued her hearts over her dwindling chances of winning the war. And to make sure no idiot stumbled across her looking for a fight during her downtime, her eyes were shielded by her filth-stained prescription glasses. 

It had been... God knows how many days since they had last spoken. Not one to rush things, Ann put her relaxation ahead of making things right with her new Servant. Prince had nowhere else to go after all, she could linger in that bar as long as she liked, knowing full well that no Magus could detect her or her Servant.

The silence between the two of them seemed to be beginning to weigh on Prince, which was not the intended reaction, but all things considered, it was quite welcome. Let him come to me of his own free will, Ann thought. No matter how he felt about the war, or how cowardly he might be, he definitely wanted to break the status quo one way or another. And the day he did would surely be the day he decided to <em>fight</em>.

Whispers and inappropriate glances swirled amongst the patrons, revealing a mix of awe, curiosity and desire at Prince’s figure.

All... but one turned to look at him as he made his way deeper inside. It was Ann, who had long since fallen asleep on the bar, her head buried between her crossed arms, only half of her crimson hair peeking out from her biker vest. Her back rose and fell calmly, the rest of her body so still you&#39;d think she was dead. How could anyone slumber so peacefully in such a dirty and unglamorous place, Prince could only wonder. Several empty glasses littered the bar around her, evidence of all the drinking she had done before the sun had even begun to set.

Prince had confirmation, allowing Ann to drink herself to death in a bar <em>definitely</em> wasn&#39;t the best decision.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that the sight of his Master knocked out in drunken stupor brought him any joy, but he would be lying if he said that he didn’t welcome the extra few minutes that chance had granted him.
Still. He had already opened the door, and with the attention of the early patrons now on him, it would be quite embarrassing to simply leave, and so he slowly made his way inside and headed for a stool close to his Master.

“Do you have any mead?”

His question was met with a clear shake of the head. Not that mead had completely lost relevancy in the modern era, but Prince should have known better than to expect his drink of choice to be offered at as small of an establishment as this one, but having yet to join Ann on one of her many excursions, neither had he yet to familiarize himself with its stock himself. Of course he had become a quick friend to the barkeep as his most lucrative customer’s bottomless wallet, but that was the extent of it.

“...then perhaps something with milk?”

Not that Prince was in any rush to address the issue at hand, and if anything, he would rather Ann stayed asleep for another hour or two to give him an excuse to go home and try again the next day.

Taking a sip in between nervous glances at his napping Master, Prince managed to distract himself from his own spiraling thoughts for the briefest of moments, his eyes regaining a little bit of their light as he sampled a modern cocktail for the first time.

Her muffled moans quickly dampened the good mood Prince&#39;s non-alcoholic drink had brought as she began to wake up. Unfortunately, it seemed that Prince would not get the chance to go home and try again the next day.

She slowly uncrossed her arms and turned her neck to the side, her ajar eyes looking in Prince&#39;s direction, but <em>not quite</em> at him directly. Her prescription glasses hung awkwardly from the tip of her nose, her face screamed exhaustion and her crimson hair somehow looked even wilder and more dishevelled than usual. To put it bluntly, she looked like shit.

&quot;Heeyy... fancyy seeing you... heere...&quot; She slurred, her voice hoarse and uncharacteristically quiet. &quot;Y&#39;came to che... cheeuh... cheeeeck up... on your... Masterrr?&quot;

Even without facing her as she spoke, Prince could still smell his master&#39;s strong alcoholic breath in every word. As if her dishevelled appearance, slurred speech and numerous empty drinks weren&#39;t enough to indicate she was <em>very</em> drunk.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“... good morning Ann. And please don’t call yourself that in public.”

A punk girl with a wild attitude who called herself her feminine companion’s ‘Master’... if there hadn’t been rumors floating around the two before, there certainly would be now.

“You aren’t doing this on purpose… right? Actually, forget I said anything.”

Not even Ann would go so far as to make herself as conspicuous as possible to attract the attention of the other Masters, would she? Sure, while that would be one way of forcing her point and giving her Servant no choice but to participate in the War to defend himself from assault, she didn’t seem quite that callous from the impression Prince had gotten from her over the past few days. She was certainly dancing close to the line though.

“How much have you been drinking today?” he asked instead, moving on from his internal train of thought and trying to measure her mood with casual conversation, “Is losing yourself like that really that much fun for you?”

And he blew it immediately.

Not that he was unaware of his own hypocrisy, having ordered a drink with the intention of it being alcoholic as well, though it would appear that some repressed feelings had managed to bubble to the surface in a moment of carelessness regardless.

Immediately he turned away and faced his own glass, taking a big sip and using it to hide his face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Anger, perhaps? Prince couldn&#39;t really tell, his face hidden behind his drink. “Pfft… heheh… hahahahaaa!!”

But then Ann suddenly threw her arm around him, a crazed laughter erupting uncontrollably from her and echoing throughout the bar. Her drunken state made it difficult to tell whether her laughter stemmed from genuine amusement or from something else, adding a layer of complexity to their already awkward exchange.

Her giggling eventually subsided, the woman clinging to her Servant&#39;s shoulders for dear life as she huffed and puffed. Suddenly, she snatched his drink from his hands, bringing the glass to her lips and taking a big gulp... then her expression turned sour and she let her tongue flop out of her mouth in disgust. “Eww, whaaat is this… dairy? You said it was good. It’s not even alo... aco… aloco… acoloholic!”

She pushed his drink out of arm’s reach and snapped her fingers a couple of times at the bartender, grabbing his attention, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

“Bartender, buddy, get me and this sissy a couple of tequila shots… and as a matter of faa… fa.. faaact…!!” She turned to the patrons sitting behind her, raising Prince’s arm high in the air as if he had just won a boxing match. “Get all of these gentlemen in the bar teeequila shots too! Drinks are on this guyyyy!!!”

A chorus of grateful cheers filled the air as patrons raised their glasses in gratitude to Prince, applauding this spontaneous act of kindness over which he had no say over…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The arm locked around his neck may as well have been a chain, her slurred raving the trumpets which dictated her will. She took his drink, abused his gift, handing him only yet another bill in return to feed her addiction.

He would have been content with leaving her to her own ruin just as he had up until this point, were it not for the resolve he had gathered to come to this place, resolve he would not see wasted so easily.

Slapping away her intrusive embrace, Prince stumbled backwards from the effort of his forced separation and raised his voice, “Is that it? Is that really how you want to spend your life!?”

Like a threatened animal he snarled at his Master with open hostility, the single shaky step he had taken to cross the threshold of defiance now escalating into a sprint.

“You join this stupid tournament for whatever stupid reason, and when you can’t get what you want you just waste away in some stupid bar? Do something. Anything! Other than ruining it…”

Prince himself did not realize how quickly the flood of his pent up bitterness burst out of him, oblivious to the uncomfortable looks he got from the bystanding patrons that had only been looking forward to free drinks a few seconds ago.

“...the privilege of being born human from the start.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“...ho.” Rather than exhibiting pain or anger, Ann’s lips curled into an eerie smile as she gently massaged the hand he slapped away with an unsettling calmness. She went on to take off her glasses, neatly putting them away inside her jacket, before her stool loudly scraped against the floor as she stood up.

Instantly, her expression darkened. The tipsy joy drained from her face, sobering into a mask of outrage as she walked up to her Servant. She reached out and firmly grabbed him by the collar, her grip tight and unwavering, not at all that of a drunk patron.

“The fuck you know about wasting away, punk?” She pulled him closer, so hard he could swear she lifted him by an inch or two off the ground. “I spent a whole week fighting off magic men with a baseball bat, stopping a giant man-eating dragon from devouring me at every opportunity, while simultaneously living in an icy cave in the middle of nowhere… meanwhile all you did after waking up was spend a week at home playing gardener in our fucking backyard!&quot;

With a forceful push, she released her grip, sending Prince tumbling backwards. A mocking grin slowly crept its way across her face as she looked down at her Servant with <em>disdain</em>.

&quot;I live to the fullest, fight to the fullest, and rest to the fullest... while <em>you</em> are the one wasting away at home. I have no respect for fools who are happy just to be alive and water plants. Shoo, get out of here. This is a place for grown-ups. Either you drink or you fight, but don’t come here and lecture me about what to do when you haven’t done and don’t plan to do <em>jack</em> in this ‘stupid tournament’.”

...now let&#39;s see if that upsets him, she thought as she sat back on her stool and looked away from Prince, as if he didn&#39;t exist.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bright light and loud noises are sure to startle, tears are shed when sad, and the heart softens when experiencing joy. Such basic human responses are not consciously steered, but reflexive reactions to outside stimuli, welling emotions beyond their owner’s control.

Now what would happen if this tide was made to churn and boil?

The very moment Ann removed her glasses, Prince could feel his blood rush in agitation, his emotional state somehow accelerated by means unknown to him. By simply laying eyes on him his irritation turned to resentment, her rough treatment of him feeding a flame that singed the edges of his vision, his mind heavy with the fog of his indignation, yet at the same time crystal clear and focused. He did not know what made him feel this way, or why it all spilled out of him all of the sudden, but at the moment he did not care. Right now he simply sought to vent and find release.

“For someone living their life to their fullest you sure seem to complain an awful lot.”

Being lifted and tossed backwards, Prince barely caught himself on a stool without falling over, the roughness of her forceful shove coaxing him to return her violence.

His hand slid across the bar counter until it bumped against an empty glass, and neglecting to so much as consider his next course of action, he gave himself to his tantrum and hurled it at Ann without regard.

“At least I’m having…” next his hands took hold of the stool that had served as his support, intending to lift and make use of it as a makeshift bludgeon, “...fun with…” but alas he was too weak to lift it any higher than his knees, the exertion palpable in his labored breaths, “...what I’m doing.”

His voice cracked as he finally decided to give up on the stool and set it down.

“At least I’m living!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The glass was hurled... pathetically at Ann, making a deaf noise as it connected with her thick jacket, lacking the force and impact one would expect. Then it bounced awkwardly off her and crashed to the floor, shattering with a less than impressive noise.

&quot;...so you&#39;re living at least, huh!&quot; Ignoring his pathetic attempt to throw a glass and grab a stool, she assumed a fighting stance, bringing her knuckles to her head and making little jumps with her toes like a boxer. &quot;But believe me, it won&#39;t last long since you&#39;re so ridiculously weak! Hell, I bet I could kick your pretty ass with TWO hands tied behind my back!&quot;

As if it wasn&#39;t obvious that she was asking for a fight, Ann started shadowboxing. She unleashed a flurry of sharp punches, dodging and weaving with nimble grace, cutting air with her fist and entire body. &quot;You know Prince, you couldn&#39;t have said it better. I&#39;m definitely trying to kill myself if I try to fight in the War with a Servant as pathetic as you.&quot;

She punched the air one last time, keeping her outstretched arm pointed at Prince, her palm telling him to come closer, the shittiest of shit-eating grins on her face. &quot;Fight me like a man, Prince.

Naked and exposed before the influence of Ann’s Mystic Eyes, something with Prince snapped as he threw all caution to the wind and let himself by goaded by the painfully obvious provocations, ultimately playing along with his Master’s plan without meaning to, let alone realizing that he did. As of the moment he simply felt the irrational need to take out his irritation, and Ann was as good a punching bag as any

Provided she allowed him to land a hit.

“Just shut up already! I never asked to be your Servant in the first place!”

Stumbling into a sprint, he blindly threw his shoulder into her body, everything from the approach to the velocity of his charge straight-forward and easily telegraphed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Shut up? How about you...&quot; But unlike a sweet and tender mother, Ann took the opportunity to skillfully harness the Servant&#39;s momentum, grabbing his shirt, twisting her body and executing a sort of judo throw that flipped Prince over her shoulder and onto the floor with a loud <em>thud</em>. &quot;...shut me up, with your own fists!&quot;

&quot;Hmpph!&quot; Without releasing her grip on his shirt, she lifted him up with some effort and hurled him into a cluster of unsuspecting barstools, the impact causing a cascade of chaos as the stools toppled over each other in a symphony of clatter and crash.

The onlookers, attracted by the commotion, formed a curious and mesmerised circle around the pair. Meanwhile, the bartender, horrified by this spectacle, desperately called out to his two lucrative customers, begging them to stop trashing his bar... but his pleas fell on deaf ears as Ann walked over to her Servant, still grinning from ear to ear.

&quot;You&#39;re right. You didn&#39;t get a say in being my Servant. You never <em>asked</em> for any of this.&quot; She said, crouching down to meet his eyes. &quot;But it&#39;s too late, you&#39;re here now, so stop being a whiny bitch about it.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Taking a moment to force air back into his lungs after Ann had unceremoniously slammed him into the ground, Prince ignored the panicked whispers of their onlookers as the state of his mind continued to deteriorate. Whipping the coughed up spit and bile on his shirt, he wasted no time resuming his attack, this time using a toppled stool as a foothold to leap straight at the source of his frustration, materializing a baseball bat in midair to swing down on her.

The Servant wildly launched himself towards the source of all his issues, swinging down at her head with all his frustration and angst.

&quot;Fair enough. I did a lot of that at first.&quot; Ann admitted, the grin slowly fading from her face. &quot;But I&#39;ve-&quot;

<em>WHAM!</em>

The bat connected directly with her head, the punk recoiling slightly from the force of the blow... yet somehow remaining resolute and unwavering. She kept her eyes on Prince, a trickle of blood running down from the point of impact, marking her brow. Slowly, she took the bat that still touched her head between her fingers and lowered it.

&quot;But I&#39;ve let go since then, which is exactly why we&#39;re having this fight in the first place!&quot; She finished her sentence, yanking the bat violently from Prince&#39;s grasp before suddenly raising a knee to the boy&#39;s unprotected gut and driving it deep into him. &quot;Because you can&#39;t be bothered to stand up and fight in the war. Because you&#39;re perfectly content with a boring life of gardening... because you insist on challenging <em>me</em> instead of challenging <em>yourself</em>!&quot;

&quot;Yes, you never asked to be my Servant!&quot; She pushed Prince away and resumed her fist-fighting stance. &quot;But now that you are... <em>why not make the most of it?!</em>&quot;

She leapt into action, sending a sharp hook to the side of Prince&#39;s pretty face, intending to drive her point home using both her words and her fists.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His face lit up like fireworks at this momentous achievement, his wild efforts actually achieving some manner of success, until suddenly, lacking the foresight to predict her counter, his stomach was caved in by the sharp thrust of Ann’s knee. His vision cut out for a brief moment, his body forgetting to breathe. The words challenging his attitude spoken by his Master failed to register as his ears could capture nothing but the sharp pitch of static.

When he finally regained his senses, it was only to take note of the fast approaching fist that filled his vision.

“Ah-”

Before it too sunk into his soft cheeks and sent him flying to the ground.

His whole body was wracked in pain, his muscles involuntarily constricting and not allowing him a single breath. His stomach… now emptied of its contents, Prince could still feel the burn in his throat, unsure of whether that was the reason for the bitter taste in his mouth, or if it was in fact the blood of his swollen cheek.

His body was still. Not because he wouldn’t move, but because he couldn’t.

His mind was a mess. Swirling and disjointed. Why was he here again? Who was it that he was fighting? For what reason did he… struggle? Accept? Live? Die?
No. He wasn’t dead yet. So he lived.

Who said that? A woman. His bride? No. She had long since passed, myth faded and frayed; he could no longer even remember her face. A friend then? If they were fighting, an enemy?

Prince didn’t know and he didn’t care.

His body felt weird. Unnatural. The effect of Ann’s Mystic Eyes made it so that every impulse became law, transforming every stray thought and whim into an absolute. So what desire possessed him right now?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, July 23, 2023 8:39 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The force of Ann&#39;s surprise knee and punch left him gagging, causing more than one customer to lower their drink in disgust and repulsion, the unexpected turn of events shaking the crowd, who were just now coming to terms with the raw and harsh reality of the situation.

But once again Ann stood unaffected, wiping the blood from Prince&#39;s previous blow with her forearm, the numb pain in her skull no doubt playing a small part in her callous attitude to her Servant&#39;s pain.

But the bigger factor lay somewhere else. After minutes of conversation between the exchanged blows, one fact quickly became clear:

<em>Prince&#39;s inhibitions had been pushed too far back.</em>

His survival instinct had taken over the rational side of his brain, making him impervious to any words Ann might have said. He heard them and processed them, but he was in no condition to ruminate or digest them. The very fact that he stayed on the ground and didn&#39;t jump at her was proof enough that this fight-slash-conversation was <em>over</em>.

&quot;Tchh… I guess I was wrong about you. You probably want nothing more than to run away by now, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ann said, barely containing the disgust and disappointment in her voice. &quot;Go, get the fuck out of here. We&#39;re done. <em>Done</em>.&quot;

With a disgusted expression on her face, Ann turned away from her defeated Servant, her eyes reflecting a mixture of frustration and pity, disheartened by Prince&#39;s lack of resilience and inner strength.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Almost slipping on his own puddle of puke as he shakily forced himself to charge forward, Prince was reduced to the uttermost basic version of himself. No capacity for regrets or pity, ambitions or desire. Not a wyrm bereft of will, nor a human slave to it.
He was simply him. Nothing more and nothing less. No remorse over regretful past or concern over uncertain future staining his heart.

Liberated as he was, he once more swung his fists, knowing they would not land, and caring little if they did. What he did now, he did for himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ann was caught by surprise as she brought her forearms up to shield her face from her Servant&#39;s crazed onslaught, blocking some of his blows, with one or two somehow slipping past her defences to hit her face.

In any other context, Ann would&#39;ve growled and fought back viciously instead of blocking... but now, as she realised the true depth of her Servant&#39;s stubbornness, a mixture of respect and awe flashed across her face wiping away her previous disgust and disappointment, her grin widened a little more with each of Prince&#39;s blows.

&quot;See!&quot; She struggled, her ever-widening smile and her Servant&#39;s struggle making it difficult to get her words out. &quot;You are a fighter! That&#39;s your true nature, Prince! You&#39;re not a coward who sits at home all day, you&#39;re not a wimp who lets himself be pushed around... you&#39;re a fucking <em>fighter</em>!&quot;

The crowd gasped in excitement and disbelief as the tables turned and the underdog somehow came out on top. Words of encouragement for Prince quickly filled the bar, the crowd now energised by this unexpected display of fight and resilience, hooing at each of Prince’s successful blows.

At first, Prince seemed to have the upper hand, taking advantage of Ann&#39;s nonchalant approach to pepper her with punches, pushing himself beyond his limits with each blow, yet somehow continuing the onslaught. But the tables were turned again when Ann finally began to fight seriously, a change that came when she pushed Prince off her and quickly got to her feet with a kick-up.

Unsurprisingly, the fight ended with a one-sided beating. Prince’s face and body had been showered with blows, each one more vicious and violent than the last, his smooth skin scraped and dotted with blueish discoloration. A busted lip and a black eye complimented his battered look, the Servant’s tastebuds overwhelmed by the metallic taste of his own blood.

He was currently lying on the floor, defeated, while his tormentor used his beat-up body as a makeshift chair to rest, the Master nonchalantly sitting on top of his stomach. She too had been injured several times, blood still trickling from Prince&#39;s earlier blow to her head, a few more cuts and bruises on her face and forearms, but her injuries were nothing compared to Prince’s.

The onlookers in the bar watched from a distance, reluctant to approach either of them, afraid that they would both make things worse for the boy on the floor and attract the attention of this woman who clearly knew how to fight. Too invested in her Servant, it was only when she pulled a cigarette out of her jacket that Ann noticed their presence around them.<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132669861886181497 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132669861886181497><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 23, 2023 8:45 AM">8:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
“The fuck you looking at?” She winced as she placed the cigarette between her lips, and looked around at the worried crowd with an expression that was none too pleased. “Do we look like a bunch of animals you can gawk at for entertainment? Piss off!”

Understanding her tone rather than her words, and with the help of a concerned owner that finally saw the opportunity to diffuse the tension in his bar, the crowd finally died down and the patrons slowly returned to their seats, still keeping an eye on the situation from afar, much to Ann’s distaste.

“...I was wrong. You’re not <em>ridiculously</em> weak, but just weak.” She reached down and ruffled Prince’s hair with her calloused hand, a hint of affection and pride in the gesture. “Wait… are you even conscious, or am I patting the head of a corpse?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His skull felt heavy, weighed down by buzzing fog that prevented him from concentrating, let alone forming a coherent thought. Even with his eyes closed, he could sense the light filtered through his lids, that slight stimulation enough to give him a headache and dread opening them fully.

<em>“Is this… what a hangover is like?”</em>

His body hurt. It would be safe to say that there wasn’t a single part of it that didn’t ache in some way or another, everything from the pulled roots of his hair and blemished skin, to the creaking bones and sore muscles within him, it seemed like his own Master had given him a beating he was likely to remember even after his return to the Throne of Heroes.

“...am I even still alive?”

The persistent pain, not to mention the familiar weight on his chest, would suggest so, but considering what he had just been through he believed it prudent to ask regardless. It was only then that he regained enough awareness to take note of the hand ruffling his head, prompting him to finally open his eyes after a laborious groan, and return to the land of the living.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She playfully used the makeshift pillow she had in his body, wiggling her bottom until she was comfortably seated on him. She inhaled deeply, filling her lungs with smoke as she looked down at her servant, a kind of... pride, or admiration, flashing across her face.

&quot;My eyes are a bit special, you see? The longer I look at someone, the less they control themselves.&quot; Smoke billowed from her mouth with every word she spoke, the combination of which with her confident demeanour created a unique aura around her. &quot;They break down barriers, liberate people, and ultimately bring their authentic selves out.&quot;

&quot;And your authentic self?&quot; She let the words hang, chuckling slightly as she affectionately pinched the Servant&#39;s cheek. &quot;I think it&#39;s pretty cool.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“You mean me swinging my fists around like an idiot was my true self? No, that’s not it…”

It wasn’t that his innermost desires were dominated by violence, but rather that acting violently was his natural reaction to her attitude in the moment. Her eyes. They had opened the lid to the emotions he usually preferred to bottle up, all in an effort to preserve his impossible expectations of a ‘human’ life. So obsessed was he with chasing those lofty illusions that his eyes lost sight of the path meant to guide him to them, only being made to refocus after being presented with Ann’s straightforward truth.

“I hit you because I was angry. If I’m sad I’ll cry, and if I’m happy I’ll smile. Is it really that simple? Is that really it?”

He whispered those words at no one in particular, his vision hot and blurry from a sudden ache.

“Are all humans like this? Doing whatever you want whenever you want? Or are you just a special nutcase that turned out to be a terrible role model?”

Prince lifted his left arm and let it weakly plop over his eyes, seemingly to make himself more comfortable, and not at all to hide his face.

“W-well…” his words come out as a stutter, which must have been due to his waning strength and no other reason, “...not that I don’t think that this isn’t a pretty cool way of living life.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But I do have this knack for making people honest with their feelings.&quot;

Seeing the emotion quickly catching up with him, and not wanting to sit on a pillow that could spontaneously erupt crying, Ann stood up from Prince&#39;s body and took a seat on the floor, right next to his limp body.

&quot;You know... I hate talking about deep things.&quot; She admitted with a small grin as she helped Prince up, until he was sitting upright next to her. &quot;I always roll my eyes when characters in a film start rambling on about the meaning of life, what human nature is, er...&quot; She waved her hand vaguely. &quot;You know, whatever other philosophical mumbo-jumbo the scenarists come up with. But it&#39;s good to have a real conversation once in a while. Let&#39;s pretend to be philosophers for a while.&quot;

She scratched her thigh awkwardly, looking straight in front of her, then continued.

&quot;<em>I think all people are like me</em>. They do whatever they want, whenever they want, and they all have exactly the life they want. From the guys who lounge around in their rooms all day, to the drunk hobos sleeping on the streets, and the trashy pole dancers who whore themselves out in shabby motels—even you, Prince.&quot; She poked him in the shoulder, drawing his attention with a grin. &quot;We&#39;re all free, and we all have exactly the life we want.&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 8:21 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The world described by Ann was not one Prince was familiar with.
His mother did not choose to be barren.
He did not choose to be born a monster.
His wife did not choose to be wed.
People were often not granted the luxury of choice, agency to decide how their life would start, progress, and end. Rarely does one choose to be homeless, to sell one&#39;s body to keep oneself fed, and to lay the blame of their hardships solely on their shoulders would be an insult to their struggles and pain. Let alone to insinuate that they desired this life for themselves.

Prince was about to speak up on his behalf, and all those wronged by fate, but his heated retort was snuffed out before it could even pass his lips after taking note of her eyes as she spoke. Bright and captivating. Enthralling. Yet for all their beauty they hid a terrible truth.
In the span of a single conversation they had reduced Prince into a mindless brawler, but in hindsight that had been one of the better outcomes. Desire was arbitrary. Whims of the heart that surfaced independently of one’s own conscious thought. To embrace those one was fond of. Discard those one wasn’t. Whether it be family, lover, or stranger. To kill or kiss. Strangle or soothe. Jump off a bridge. Eat a hearty meal. Do nothing. Cross the line. Assault. Abandon.

“I see…” he spoke softly, “No wonder you see the world that way.”

Before Ann’s uncompromising gaze, all was rendered naked and clear. Reduced to its most simplest ingredient.
If one’s every action was dictated by one’s heart and soul, why wouldn’t their lives be the very expression of their desires? Thus everybody must be happy and content. Thus she must be as well.

“Your eyes are twisted and wrong. I can’t even imagine what it must have been like growing up with them… but I think you are forgetting what it is like to live without them.”

His hand moved to his chest, as if reaching for the Rose within and seeking its warmth.

“We were both born unnatural, but what about everybody else? I doubt the people that died on that plane had any choice in the matter, and as for your eyes… you say they liberate people?”

He shuddered despite the heat and sweat from his exertions, his voice becoming a little more serious.

Prince let out a sigh to calm himself, realizing that he had taken this conversation into a darker territory than he had intended to.
The power Ann carried was terrible, but having borne it from birth she had become too used to it. He didn’t expect for what he said to suddenly change her mind, but at the very least he wished to hear what she thought about it now that she had voiced her unique perspective on the agency of the people around her.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 7:45 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The way the Prince looked, it was easy to forget that he was anything <em>but</em> an effeminate teenage boy. His wisdom and sensitivity over her Mystic Eyes shouldn&#39;t have seemed shocking or out of place for a Magi, but to the ignorant commoner that Ann was, it did.

She furrowed her brow, scratched her head and pondered the Servant&#39;s words.

“...I think I see your point. In fact, you may actually be onto something.” She admitted, her fingers instinctively drifting to her eyes, touching her fluttering eyelids softly. “My eyes <em>are</em> a bit special. It’s like you said, they twist my perception of the world and the people in it. It’s not that I don’t remember what it’s like to live without them. I’ve never <em>not</em> lived without them. And that is precisely what gave me a perspective on life that most don’t have.”

She turned her head towards him, her expression softening.

“You said my eyes ‘burn your choices’?” She repeated, breaking into a mischievous chuckle. “Heh, that’s a very pessimistic way of interpreting their effect!”

Leaning back with a laugh, Ann rested her hands behind her head on the dirty floor, her gaze fixed on the cracked ceiling above. 

“Cuz the way I see it, the less control you have over yourself, the more liberated you are from societal pressure and your own self-restrictions.” She declared, her fist resting on her heart. “That means you’re free to explore the world without holding back. Being authentic, living life unapologetically, embracing your true self… that’s the ultimate form of freedom.”

“<strong>That’s how you live a fulfilling and enriching life.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

We are probably lucky that this ended in a fistfight and not something more extreme…”

His words trailing off into a concerned grumble, Prince shuddered to consider the possibilities of him disrobing in public to escape the heat, taking a nap in someone else’s bed to rest, or throwing the local stray cats in the river for disturbing his garden.
And those were the harmless kind of concerns.

“I am going to leave fulfillment and enrichment to you. For now, I am happy just slowly getting used to enjoying this life,” he admitted with a defeated expression, “But who knows. Perhaps one day I will get there.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a fleeting moment, she thought about flat-out <em>ordering</em> him to loosen up, since he couldn&#39;t go against her words anyway, but that idea was quickly dismissed. Not only would that be paradoxical, but it just felt wrong to make him break his own chains. He had to do it to himself for it to mean anything.

But maybe... some folks wanted those shackles. Needed the leash of restraint. The idea seemed foreign to her, but if Prince insisted on it even after being subject to her eyes... it had to mean something. A few silent seconds ticked by as she ruminated the idea, again and again.

&quot;...fine, whatever.&quot; She finally grumbled, blowing over a stray lock of hair from her face. &quot;Even if we don&#39;t see eye to eye on <em>how</em> to live it up, I reckon you&#39;re cut from the same cloth as me. Just a different shade of freedom—one that bring you peace of mind, I guess, or whatever the hell.&quot;

She slung her arm around his aching neck, giving it a good squeeze, an unapologetic grin on her face. &quot;You&#39;ll get there. Just follow my lead, buddy! You can keep your &#39;choices&#39; and &#39;restraint&#39;,&quot; she air-quoted with her free hand. &quot;But don&#39;t think for a second I&#39;m slowing down on my joyride through life for you. I&#39;m leaving you behind if you don&#39;t at least try to catch up!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
