No longer could it be ignored, as she held a bleeding, heavily injured man with but one arm, whose vital warmth had brought her mind to a fever pitch.

What was, at first, a baying voice in her head had become an unbearable cacophony.  The paranoia she faced, both of a distrust of her enemies and of her own incompetence, had brought her from the edge of just-hanging-on with the others around to being nearly inconsolable.  Even in physical terms, Triboulet wasn’t the best candidate for triage - aside from her a gunshot and what else at the enemy Archer’s hands, she was inebriated and only upright from the sheer pulse of adrenaline that consumed her.

James had a rough landing that was sure to exacerbate wounds.  Triboulet came down from the rooftops of Berenice and landed in an alleyway, stumbling on the last step and falling onto her face, as well as throwing him off.  

There was a slurred curse from her, and then she pulled along the ground hand-and-feet until she was at his side, where she rolled him upright.

“God…god damn it all…”  Her face was bright red, and in this state she couldn’t control tears from running down her face.  More than morose, she seemed furious in all directions.  “I’m such a terrible idiot!”

With her knife, still a dimmed red from Archer’s blood on its blade, she made a token effort to wipe it clean and then used it to slice the fabric of her shirt sleeve.  Her frantic effort had little outlet, and she only really knew to staunch the bleeding by covering the wounds with a cloth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If he had more energy inside of him, a yell would have replaced it instead. But, to no one’s surprise, blood loss and fatigue robbed most of what energy he could draw upon from him.

 All of his focus was to ensure that his hand held tight onto the deep stab wound on his side. The bullet scar near his eyebrow wasn’t bleeding as much so that wasn’t of much concern right now. The only other wound that bled James dry of whatever seconds he had remaining on this world was his heel. A messy gash from a knife of sorts dug its way into his ankle, slowing them down even further.

If Assassin wanted to save her Master, they needed to treat these wounds now.

“I don’t…sense a Servant following…” His voice was interjected with raspy gasps of air, pain stabbing throughout his lungs with each attempt made to breathe, as he did what he could to be of some use here. “...I think…We’re good to stay here…”

To make matters worse, the fatigue that came from the adrenaline wearing off in his system was threatening to have him fall asleep as his eyes struggled to remain open at times. 

Just as she was cutting into her sleeve, his other hand was placed on top of her hand. “My coat…There’s more to use…” The coat James brought with him was torn by whatever tried to dig its claws into his side but there was still plenty of usable material still. Much more than what her shirt sleeve could provide them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129913869037469747 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129913869037469747><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:14 PM">6:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The knife in her hand was far from as deft as it could be, but even drunk, she was able to keep it steady enough to start shearing off more makeshift bandages.  It was already stained with blood from multiple sources and dirtied by the back wall, but what else could she use?

A fine piece of clothing ruined, she at least knew how to best draw the resultant scraps into bandages.  “We’re not good to stay.  Someone will find us soon, somewhere nearby - please, don’t follow us…”

She wasn’t all there and she made a pitiful noise as she tightened one bandage around his ankle - pushing him against the wall and holding him in place as he protested against her touching his wound, making a token effort to clear the dust off.  The bandage was dark red the moment it touched there; it wasn’t going to be enough.

The wound on his chest...not only was there a bullet somewhere in there, one that she had no idea how to remove beyond cutting it all out, it was large enough of a cut that she wouldn’t be able to properly cover it even if she used his whole coat.

“Damn it, damn it!”  She roughly pushed him onto his side as she tried in vain to wrap what she had left around her Master’s torso, but she continued to fumble.  “What am I supposed to do?!  I’m no goddamned surgeon, I’m a fool!  Damn, damn, damn…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

How long could they do this little dance, though? How many times will it take until the next shake of hers fails to wake him back up? Scraps of a dirty coat wasn’t  going to cut it. 

<strong>If she didn’t do anything more meaningful, and quick, she was going to lose him.</strong>

“...” A soft mumble eked out of his mouth. The words were unintelligible until he attempted a second time. “...First Aid. Some people have these kits in their home…” His grip was shifted until he had both hands on the makeshift bandage to stop the bleeding. “It should help us until we reach that doctor and his dog…I will be fine. Go. I’ll only slow you down.” One of those was a lie but what other choice did she have? It was that or watch James slowly die instead.

It was most likely the delirium caused by the blood loss but James thought of a way to help Triboulet through this. Whether he regretted it later depended on if he made it out of this or not.

“Tri…” A bloodied hand was placed upon her cheek as the red glow shined off of his hand. Wait, he couldn’t… “By the power of this command spell, <strong>please calm down.</strong>” The other wing shined bright before becoming a faded smudge just like other one, leaving just the body, and his last command spell, remaining. 

“Don’t make me regret that now.” Even at death’s door, this man had the audacity to smirk at her, albeit weakly, of course.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

How was this happen--no, she knew why this was happening, it was all because she was an idiot who seriously thought there’d ever be time to rest in war.  She didn’t gain anything from today!  She’s only lost!

Each shake was more vigorous.  Her drunken mind swirled with panic, and every motion on James’ face was taken as a premonition of an immediate passing.  “God, give me this chance…”  Her hands pressed down tight onto his side, but slipped with the blood, her fear and her own barely-there coordination.

For a moment, her mind even turned to contingency - how would she survive in the future? Was it even truly possible for her to survive?  In theory yes, but her state right then wasn’t in a place to consider theoreticals.  She saw this as a failure brought on by inattention that’d ruin her one chance at a new life, and she’d go back to the grave, all for nothing.

His demand for a first-aid kit was initially lost in the commotion; she heard it but could only come up with half-start sentences.  If it weren’t for James reaching upward, she’d continue to struggle and only exacerbate his wounds.  She didn’t know anything more than to struggle.  She imagined this gesture as his last action, and listened with grave intention…

…and was left without words at what he actually did, in more than one way.  Another time and she might’ve chewed him out again for such a waste, but she couldn’t bear to, and moreover, she couldn’t bring herself to anger now.  It was completely impossible.  Clarity overtook her mind in a way that she wasn’t sure she ever had felt, and everything that could’ve clouded her judgment was washed away in an instant.  For a moment, Triboulet imagined, she was indeed the calmest soul in the world.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129914121756880966 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129914121756880966><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:15 PM">6:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A state sought by people throughout history, and she was given it solely because of her drunken panicking.

She stepped up, and looked at him down on the ground, moments away from death, and felt peace.  She looked at her hands and felt peace.  She looked at her reflection in an old window nearby, James’ bloody handprint staining her face, and she felt peace.

“...I’m sure you will,” she said, dispassionately.  “Tell me quick, what does a first aid kit look like?  Is it just in anyone’s home?”  Already, she was stepping back, ready to leave him to God’s will on whether she would find him dead on her return.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“It’s usually a red box or bag. Sometimes it’s white. It has a cross on it…People tend to keep it in a cabinet of sorts.” James drew the general shape of the cross next to him in the ground. The red from the blood even made it fit the colour scheme of it, as morbid as that was. “Not everyone has one… You’ll have better luck in more well-off households…”

“I trust you, Tri…” A soft shuffle to get comfortable was done. His hand reaffirmed the pressure needed to keep on the wound to help grant her as much time as he could give her. It was all on her now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“You’ll see me soon, old man.  One way or another.”  With that, an ill-placed step turned her around, and she was off into the sky once again.

With this supernatural calm, it almost made the search easy.  Her legs still held a spirit of wobble within them, and vertigo poked at her senses when she looked down for footing, but her focus brought her along the rooftops of the city far better than she would’ve had to otherwise.  Her idea was set: she needed to find the house of the wealthy, a landed noble or some rich merchant, for they were all the more likely to keep this sort of thing on them.  Just get in there, get the bag, and get out - no matter what intervened.

Her hope came in the form of a house of white stone, one of the few that stood on its own, with a small garden around it that had been tended to in the same spot for centuries.  There was even a worker laboring to keep things tidy with the desert sunshine, and instantly, Triboulet knew that this was a better chance than anything.  She only hoped that the minute she spent getting here wasn’t too long.

Over the fence and to the wall in a single bound, she failed to grasp the edge of the roof on her first attempt and slid down.  Blood streaked from her hand and sullied the clean sides as she gripped on tight, only finding footing when she came to a window.  Immediately, she dropped down and clung to the windowsill, and then reached with her bad arm to pull the window upward.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129914370672054396 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129914370672054396><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:16 PM">6:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It didn’t budge at first, as she couldn’t force her arm to push more than weakly.

She found herself in a hallway, comfortable and homey in the local fashion, with pictures of a family on one wall and a kitschy painting on the other - and many white doors that each had no hint of their contents.  Triboulet would only find out by laboriously looking through each one, wasting more and more precious time…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her first door brought her to a small reading room which smelled of past smoke, and she ducked out as quickly as she stepped in - no chance of hurting yourself there, unless you get a paper cut.

Her second guess was a door down.  This one was locked, and after a jostle she decided to open it with force.  One hand on the knob and another held out to distribute force, she rammed her petit shoulder into the side and gave it far more of a bash than someone her size should be able to.  The lock broke instantly, loudly, and she was given access to the next room: a bedroom, probably the master bedroom.

Assassin made short work to check here, as it wasn’t in the closet by the bed which she confirmed by upending boxes of photos and old clothes.  The cabinet at the head of the room similarly lacked anything.  ID cards and coins fell out of one as she pulled out one drawer entirely, and the next one held jewelry - gaudy rings, silver chains, each one worth more money than she had spent with her wasteful trip with Archer today, but of no use to her now.

She left the room a mess, with a loud clatter as she tossed the drawer of valuables over her shoulder, letting those dozen items jingle as they crashed against the bedframe and the wall.  Two rooms down, who knows how many to go?  She ran out to the hallway.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That or they just didn’t care enough to bother at all. Both were great outcomes for her all things considered. One less thing to worry about. A silver lining in this disastrous event!

These minor victories ultimately meant nothing if she didn’t succeed in finding the first-aid kit for James. Just how could she narrow out the location of it, though? Skim through the rooms too quickly and it was very likely that she might just end up passing by it completely. What if she already did? Maybe it was inside one of those two rooms she already checked? The only way to find out would be to double-check. Could she afford to spend the time checking? Wha-

“Mom?”A tired child-like voice spoke up in the middle of her quest. The source? A little girl who appeared to have woken up from a nap. Her hand was rubbing out the tiredness from her eyes until her vision cleared up enough to notice that Triboulet was merely a stranger inside of her home, not her mother. 

“Wh..who are you?” A look of fear was subtle on her face, but present nonetheless. “Why were you in my mother’s room?” Concern was on the edge of each of her words. A step back was made ever so slightly.  If the clattering of valuables she tossed over her shoulder wasn’t enough to draw attention, a scream might instead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just looking at her was probably enough to send some screaming, let alone to see this in your house in the middle of the day.

Immediately, the shame she felt briefly eclipsed the calm - she had let a child detect her!  Seriously, Trib?  Had you been any less aware, that ice dragon could’ve snuck up behind you and taken a bite from your flank before you noticed.

A little girl, carrying with her the same tired face she could recall seeing on a certain homebody many times - a yawn and a stretch and a little shuffle of feet.  The picture of innocence, and one of the few boundaries she had.  No reason to drag children into your misery.

Unfortunate, then, that her sense of morality seemed to work slower than her sense of reflex.

From an outsider’s perspective, there was less than a second between the intruder being spotted and the rush of wind as she displaced herself.  The girl felt a hot wetness come over her mouth as a bloody hand silenced her before her vision even caught up, and a gentle pull backwards to get her off-balance.  Triboulet was suddenly covering her, keeping her in-place and as quiet as she could.

By the time she was in place, Triboulet had forgotten to feel more shame over it, and it suddenly hit her.  The calm, almost a geas of its own, had pushed her to work within the boundaries of whatever was most efficient, rather than what she felt was right.  And by god, did this feel wrong.  Instantly, she felt regret for an action that was too quick to retract, for she could only imagine how this’d affect the girl in the following years.

…and yet, she continued.  The regret was far from strong enough to overpower James’ Command Seal.  She would dispense with this quickly.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129914859702722601 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129914859702722601><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:18 PM">6:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“...I’m very sorry,” she whispered into her ear in as clear of a tone as she could make, a quiver present from her self-directed disgust.

A knife, not held to her throat but very intentionally placed within the girl’s vision, provided ample reason to listen.

“Don’t shout, please.  Keeping quiet, that’s a good thing, yes?  Yes.  Now, I need you to tell me: do you have a first aid kit in this house?  Can you lead me to it?  All I need to do is borrow it, and then, I will leave you and your family alone.  Forever.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

To no one’s surprise, it was an easy task to subdue the child. 

Her thoughts were racing as her eyes darted fanatically for anyone to come and save her. That’s what heroes tend to do, right? Come swooping in at the last second to save a civilian in need! Except there came no one to save her. 

It was clear to anyone watching that her trembling meant she was panicking but she was too scared to force any sounds out of her throat, muffled they may be if she could manage something to come out. Her erratic breathing was out of sync as she felt the blood on her hand mark her face with whoever’s blood it was that covered it. Was it her parents? Oh god, did she kill them? Tears ran down her cheeks once that thought entered her mind.

A muffled gasp found its way out of her mouth and into the bloodied hand once she saw the knife enter her sight. The sight of it made her body tense up even further. A few tugs were done to get away from it, thinking she was next.

Whatever courage she managed to muster was enough to slowly turn her head so she could stare up at her assailant. Her eyes poured tears almost as much as she shook from the fear. Her hyperventilating breathing threatened to cause her to pass out if she didn’t get it under control soon. 

Soon a task was given to her. A first aid kit? Sure, she saw it before. Just where did her parents tell her again, though? Her shaking worsened as memories failed to tell her the answer to allow her to escape this nightmare. What she did know, however, was that it wasn’t up here.

A trembling nod was made to Triboulet. She agreed to her terms and would slowly guide her step by step. Her finger pointed towards the stairs which led to the floor before. So she would have wasted time searching through all of these rooms, huh? But how much was truly being saved if they had to move at this pace?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For all she claimed to regret this, she wasn’t relenting, was she?  Even as this girl was crying in sheer terror, at her and her disturbing face and the very real threat she presented.  Her emotions only came out as a little frown then, because apparently anything more was beyond her.

A direction was given.  She looked towards it, her knife turning away briefly - of course it wasn’t up here.  She’d have torn apart the entire floor if it weren’t for this girl, at least, so whatever hesitation she felt was rewarded in saved time.  Manhandling her down the stairs and through wherever, though, that was going to be a gamble.  Even with her strength, the position was simply that awkward, and not helped by her present incoordination.

Her knife lowered further.  “Good.  Good.”  It was meant to be reassuring, but came out far more chilling, threatening than she intended - drawn out, like she enjoyed her fear.

“I’m going to let go of you now.  You’ll take me down there, quietly and calmly, and to the room.  Don’t make any loud noises or anything - I just need the kit.  You show me the room, and you’ll never see me again.  A deal?”

When she received another hand-held nod of affirmation, Triboulet let her go.  Maybe this really was too much for her, if she let this happen.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her words of comfort did very little towards calming her down. Though, she couldn’t decide if she would be more calm hearing her words or if she just chose to remain silent. Both were unsettling thoughts to her. The lack of any true remorse from her expression made her all the more threatening. All she could manage was a simple frown out of all of this? She must be crazy! A lunatic with a knife!

The showcase of speed earlier wiped any thoughts of escaping from her mind. If she even tried to she was pretty sure that she wouldn’t make it a single step forward before becoming her next victim. 

With a second nod, her mouth was freed. The damp sensation of blood, along with its iron stench, would haunt her dreams for the following years to come. It was unlikely that she could ever look at blood calmly the same way again. 

“It’s down here…” Her voice shook and remained unsteady, just like her legs. Both hands held onto the handrail as she took careful steps so that she wouldn’t trip on herself. The slow descent allowed her to at least think about where the kit was. Was it the bathroom? No. Nothing like that was there. 

Panic began to set in her mind as the location continued to be a mystery to her. That is until she saw the kitchen. 

That’s right. The memory of her mother setting the first aid kit in the cupboard above the fridge entered her mind when she saw the room. A small sense of hope entered her heart. She might make it out of this yet!

Another direction was given as she pointed to the cupboard above the fridge. “It’s in there...” While she couldn’t for the life of her keep her finger still, it was clear where she was pointing. Her voice trembled as sniffles were made due to the tears. 

With the remaining amount of rooms on this floor, she could have easily wasted too much time searching through them if she didn’t choose the kitchen from the start.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No knife in the dark nor hidden pair of stark eyes; it seemed as if her assailant had departed.  But that couldn’t be right, could it?  The stranger must be hiding nearby.  She could run, or scream, but that could bring her back in an instant.

What did bring her back was her next point, just after she entered the kitchen.  The intruder seemed to walk right out of her peripheral vision, and she stepped over to the cupboard.  The knife was gone entirely, it seemed.  “Thank you.”

Assassin bounded up to the cupboard from the floor in one utterly silent leap, looking more like footage from a movie played in reverse than a human movement.  She tore through the cupboard in contrast, paying no heed as she pulled out and tossed away paper towels, dish soap, bandages meant for small scrapes…

…and, just as the girl said, it was here.  A red bag, large, easily wider than Triboulet’s torso but marked with a green crescent instead of the cross.  Text in Arabic clearly marked its purpose, so there wasn’t any ambiguity, only some cultural mistranslation.  She took it in her hands, pulling out the rest of the cabinet’s contents as she pushed right through them.  It was a hefty thing, and truly, Triboulet felt genuine calm this time.

She stepped back down, and she looked at the girl whose life…she had probably ruined.  This wasn’t an age where violence was a fact of life for all, and the rich were especially exempt.  Now she had been given something to remember for the rest of her life.

Pity could be given now, and shame could be felt later - was there anything, at all, that she could do to fix this?  Was it worth the time it’d take?  She was short on it as-is, she couldn’t spare anything other than what was absolutely necessary.

…and yet, she had to.  That was something that was certain above all rational decision.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129915110031376508 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129915110031376508><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet tried to smile, but stopped - the blood probably just made it far more disconcerting than it needed to be.

Still stunned, her mind barely processed that Triboulet returned to stand in front of her once again. A slight jolt was done as her attention was brought back to reality.

That smile would forever be carved into her memories, made ever haunting from the presence of the blood on her body. Never to leave. Never to be forgotten.

However, what came next would also remain in her mind for the years to come.

Any other nightmare would’ve sought to torment her further. Not this one. This one offered comfort.

Her aversion towards blood from this scarring event was unlikely to leave her. Perhaps, though, that was all she had to carry with her throughout her life. If she just followed the intruder’s words, of course.

“...Mhm…” The fear still remained strong within her, allowing for just that sound of confirmation to be returned opposed to actual words.

She could’ve disappeared right there, concealing herself and taking off, but that’d only make things worse for the child.  Imagine “...then, the burglar waved her hand, and suddenly she became but vapor right before my eyes!”  The child probably didn’t speak so theatrically, but still.

So, more time was burnt.  She kept eye contact with her, walked backwards - her bum arm feebly grabbed for the kitchen counter and slipped with its infirm grip - before she simply hopped up to the sink in one vertical leap.  Then, a final look outside…

…and a quick “Sorry, once again”...

…and then she walked out the window.  If the child was brave enough to follow after and look through, she’d see nothing but her own enclosed yard…but she wasn’t that brave, and that was fine.  She could go and run and cry and tell her parents what happened, and that would be enough for this awful day.

Triboulet, freed from that responsibility, became like the wind.

The streets became a blur, the fool sprinting so fast that the awnings and stalls flapped with the burst of air that came in her passing.  She had terrible regrets to process in the coming days, but she absolutely couldn’t afford to dwell on them for a second, now.  This was a race to the finish, whether it’d be for this ordeal, or for the war, she had yet to find out.

The return to James’ resting place was abridged in its final moments, as when she was faced with a web of alleys and narrow back roads, she elected to bypass them.  Across one, two, multiple city blocks, she leaped, all going by in one incredible burst of acrobatics that would be rare to see in any Servant, let alone living thing…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129915220387696722 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129915220387696722><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>…and she did not stick the landing.  Triboulet’s midsection whacked against the edge of a building, and she fell down about 15 feet to the ground with a burst of dust to celebrate her arrival, but she had arrived.  This was the alley.

Before she even finished turning to check if James was still with her, she had unzipped the kit and tossed it down to the ground to begin her work.  This haste wasn’t unrewarded.  Her Master was still there, alive!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His head hung low with his chest having almost no signs of moving. At least, that is how he looked from afar. To Triboulet, the very subtle signs of life were still present inside of him, however faintly they may be.

“What took you so long?...” James spoke while lifting his head ever so slightly to look in her general direction. Great care was taken to prevent their eyes meeting once again. A chuckle was cut short from the pain his chest felt upon attempting to laugh, even for a bit. The curtain of death must be making him delirious if cracking jokes were on his mind like this.

The sight of his Servant with the first aid bag, though different in appearance, brought a sense of relief over him. Maybe this alleyway wasn’t going to be his deathbed, after all. He wasn’t out of the woods yet. A lot of things could still go wrong with it. 

“Do you know how to use it, Tri?” Despite the pain, James shifted to get into a much better position so he could allow her to do what she needed to do. If she knew how, of course.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had an array of dozens of different pieces and sutures and medicines before her.  Many were labeled, yes.  Others had instructions, some pictorial.  The daunting variety of things before her though, as this was a truly well stocked kit, had her immediately befuddled.

She looked at them, holding up her hands before her like she was preparing to reach for something.  Slowly, a slight shake came into her fingers, and she lowered them.

“No,” she admitted.  Unease was there, past her calm.  “Not very much at all.”

Some work had to be done, though - James could pass out at any moment, and she couldn’t rely on him solely.  Her hands passed over the kit once again, and she eventually held up a fat wad of white something - pulled apart, it was gauze, or a white, clean cloth that seemed very thick to her own sensibilities.  

Immediately, she put it in her stable arm and reached forward, prepared to tie it against his leg without any other preparation.  “Here, don’t move too much…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Sounds were getting muddled and vision was becoming more blurred over time. However, it wasn’t enough that James didn’t catch her attempting to dress first.

“No. No. Don’t. You clean the wound first, then you glaze. Otherwise the wound could get dirty.” A hand was held out to stop her. He didn’t know much about first-aid but he knew the basics plus some due to the doctor visits. Never in a lifetime did he think that same knowledge would be applied to saving his own life. 

“There should be some wipes in there that you could use. It does looks high-end, after all.” While she did that, James did his best to prop up his wounded foot up on his other leg to keep it off the ground for her to work on it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dear god, she really is out of her element.  Triboulet recoiled, the gauze’s trailing end grazing against the ground.  “Yes, yes,” she held herself back, “I’m…I understand.”  Her nerves briefly got ahold of her, her spent limb still quivering despite the pain that went through it, but she placed her hands upon her kneeling legs and took a deep breath.  

This was no time to let concern get to her.  The curse wouldn’t take this man.

She went to work.  Her fingers brushed over the kit like a cursory hand over a page, and they settled on the correct packet after some searching.  It was torn open, and then another, and another, as she had much to clean away from the sight of the wound.  It was deep and still bled a healthy amount, as if it was actively fighting her efforts to disinfect it.  James felt the sting of the alcohol as it brushed against his exposed flesh, but it was nothing compared to what else remained present.

Her face contorted as it looked deep into the gap in his limb - illustrating the sad fact that she simply wasn’t as acquainted with the violence expected of a Servant.  It took a breath and a huff, and some concerted effort, but when she turned away from the torn hole she had some humor to keep James in the moment.

She held up her shot arm to his shoulder and faintly shook him, not able to do much more, as she finished doing what she could to clean his wound.  “What’s the idea here, James?  You’re losing blood, you’ve lost the fight, your good sense is long lost…what else is left to lose?  Your riches?  I’ve lost all you’ve given me.  Your virginity?  Maybe you adopted!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pain was good. Pain meant he was still alive. Still <em>fighting</em>. 

No answer came from James when his Servant attempted to liven up the mood to keep his mind off of the impending death that was nearing him. Until after his fourth heavy breath of his panting did he finally speak. “My daughter… I still have her but I can’t lose her… Anything but her.” His words dipped into a fading tone, as if he were passing out but he jerked himself alive. 

Right. He was in an alleyway bleeding out. What were they doing? The next step, right!

“Bandage it up tightly. Don’t worry about the bleeding... We just need to find that doctor and his mutt. Information where that brat lives will be enough to pay for him to heal this up properly…” With his finger, James drew an imaginary circle around his wounds. So that was his plan. Stabilize and reach an actual doctor. His hand returned to the wound in his side so he could still dump more Mana into repeatedly casting his Healing Magecraft. The bleeding from it stopped, fortunately.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet could do ‘tightly’.  Tightness was a simple instruction, and there was no ambiguity in simply binding a wound shut.  A coil of white speckled with red spun around his leg multiple times once his hand drew away, each inch of it quickly becoming stained deeply once it came into contact with his limb.  One roll of gauze went away, and then a second as she made certain that the bindings would hold.

She looked at him somewhere towards the end of the first spool.  Her face kept its neutral calmness, though even as James flicked in and out of consciousness, the edge in her voice was plain.  “Tell me, who among you two started it?”  She leaned a little closer to look directly into his eyes as she worked.  “I don’t know why you would find yourself in an inn.

“I did…” Complete honesty. As much as he wanted to look her in the eyes when he said that, both of them knew why he couldn’t. Not here. “...Ruler’s clues told me that the brat would be alone. An easy target. You wanted a day to yourself. I didn’t want to interrupt that…” James stiffened up his posture once he felt himself drifting off a bit too much at the end there. A few movements of his body here and there kept the pain coming. A stupid, but effective, way of staying awake.

“I almost had him. The kid was skilled in dealing with Mental Interference Magecraft so my eyes were turned against me. I barely got out before he figured out how to properly use that place. The rest is, well, you can see how that turned out…” As he spoke, using story-telling as a way to keep his mind busy and focused, he directed her to repeat the process to the wound on his side now.

The last few orbits about his leg went by silently.  Triboulet looked at her work with concern, or pensiveness.  This was no revelation, as she wouldn’t have asked if she didn’t have an inkling…or that it wasn’t obvious.  It couldn’t be said that she was without fault, either.  Not that she would admit it.  Her request made her feel…well, that utterance of “Idiot” could be applied either way.

She pulled up a compact bottle from the kit - pain relievers, something that she could understand.  Narrow white pills came out, and she forced a couple into his mouth without being requested.  Chalky, and with the dryness that coated his whole throat, getting it down would be painful.

“I’m not going to harangue you.  That is something that you’ll do to yourself, I imagine.”  Now, she wanted to tear into him, to make him feel guilty, no, to feel too scared to think about running off like that again.  Hypocrisy and something else, uncertain, saved him from that.  “Either of us do this again, and we shall die.  For every time I’ve made a jest about joining you in the grave, I doubt we really, truly want it…”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just as his mouth opened in an attempt to say something to break the silence, he was soon met with a mouthful of chalky and awful tasting pills. His saliva did little work towards getting them down. There was no fighting it, though. He knew they were for his own good, even if it made it painful to swallow.

“Already am.” Before she could lay it on him for nearly killing himself with this sad attempt at an assassination, it was likely that he had been chastising himself since they escaped that alleyway and into this one. No need to jump in and add onto it, though, it would probably help. For now, her last words would be enough.

“I know…” A faint chuckle was made before he continued. “Besides, it would be a terrible act if you did end up dying before me, especially with that trick of yours on your side.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet leaned over and rolled James onto his side, and with a few grunts of pain as she tried to put his weight equally onto both of her arms, she had him up.  Now, it would be difficult, but she couldn’t wait for things to improve on their own.

…though, one person’s life certainly wouldn’t improve.  She had that girl in the back of her mind, and she was present enough to say “James, earlier…” before she kept it silent, and down.  She’d never bring it up around him, not until the war was over and…and they were the victors.

They didn’t have much chance to win with how easily they folded, she knew.  Like wet paper with this performance in mind.
