A growing body needed nutrients, but this unexpected guest of hers was already on their fifth plate, with no visible hint of slowing down. She was lucky that the church&#39;s fridge was well-stocked from the community lunch. Otherwise, she wouldn&#39;t even know where to procure fresh ingredients at this time of the day.

The nun had worked up an appetite from watching the child eat, which was rare, though she had no intention of eating herself. 

Rather, her attention had been on the child this whole time. Making sure they were eating all their vegetables. Making sure they didn&#39;t choke.

Though she soon found herself worrying over nothing. The child had a bottomless appetite. Once or twice she even had to remind them to spit out the pomegranate peels, before they swallowed them whole.

&#39;Slow down,&#39; she reminded the child for what must have felt like a dozen times. &#39;Are you thirsty? Want some water?&#39; 

She gestured to the glass sitting inches from the child&#39;s dominant hand. The glass had remained full since the start of this impromptu supper, which she had &#39;cooked&#39; extravagantly...by heating up the leftover dishes in the fridge. 

No choice but to make do with what she had on hand.

The child looked up from their plate, this time half way through chewing a whole banana peel, and stared at Rosula from the shadow behind their hood.  Rosula felt compelled to grab the banana peel and throw it into the trash, but the child, as if sensing Rosula&#39;s intent, quickly stuffed the whole thing into their mouth, chewed, and gulped it down.

Then they gingerly wiped their mouth on a scrap of their raggedy outfit.

&#39;Thank you, Sister, but I&#39;m not thirsty,&#39; the child replied politely.

Despite not having consumed a drop of water since their encounter, the child&#39;s voice had grown stronger, gradually taking on a melodious tone that felt oddly pleasing to her ears. It wasn&#39;t angelic enough to evoke the imagery of a winged cherub in her mind, but it certainly was soothing, and oddly convincing.

She was ready to believe their words...

But then common sense kicked in. 

&#39;You should still drink a little,&#39; the nun insisted, nudging the glass towards the child. &#39;Hydration is important. You should really be sipping on water every few mouthfuls,&#39; she chided.

&#39;I&#39;m alright,&#39; the child shook their head with the same politeness. &#39;My kind does not feel thirst like you do.&#39;

Rosula&#39;s hand froze mid-gesture. 

&#39;Your kind?&#39; She repeated blankly, following the child&#39;s motions with her eyes. They scooped more food from their plate, the hand holding the spoon cracked and blackened, reminding her of the branches of a charred, dying tree.

Now that she&#39;d noticed, she started to find even more discrepancies with their appearance. Never mind the black soot that seemed to be evaporating off of them every passing second, the better question was, how hadn&#39;t she noticed it until now? 

&#39;<em>Your</em> kind,&#39; she said again, with increasing awareness.

The distant alarm she had pushed all the way to the back of her mind finally began to resurface, bringing forth some slivers of fact that she had struggled to grasp. The child had said something along similar lines before, only that she hadn&#39;t the mind to piece their words together. &#39;You are not human.&#39;

Silence fell between them, broken only by the sound of silverware clacking on the plate. The child took a break from eating and inclined their head. &#39;I am not human,&#39; they agreed, &#39;Therefore, I cannot get thirsty.&#39;

Rosula suppressed the surging panic within her. &#39;What are you then?&#39;

&#39;A Servant,&#39; came the pleasant reply, phrased so succinctly as if it was almost too obvious to need any exposition. Then, as if anticipating the all-too-cliched <em>&#39;But what is a Servant?&#39;</em>, the child added, &#39;Don&#39;t be afraid. I&#39;m not a ghost. You can&#39;t exorcise a Servant with holy scriptures, anyway. Father Andreas taught you that much, I believe.&#39;

Rosula sat there, stunned. She couldn&#39;t quite recall what exactly Father Andreas had told her about Servants. Well, for starters, he had told her a great many things about them. But all that information had become a jumbled mess in her head. To sift through them was akin to unraveling a ball of yarn with the end tucked deep inside. The information she had read just an hour ago sitting far enough away from her reach.

But first. &#39;How do you know of Father Andreas?&#39;

The child spoke just before Rosula finished speaking her last syllable. &#39;You&#39;re curious about <em>that</em>? But it&#39;s really quite obvious, isn&#39;t it?&#39;

She frowned. &#39;No. It&#39;s not.&#39;

&#39;Well, you left the office door open.&#39;

&#39;I brought you straight to the kitchen.&#39;

&#39;Ah, well, I&#39;m a Servant,&#39; the child claimed unabashedly. &#39;Therefore, my eyesight is better than yours. A single glance is all I needed.&#39;

Liar. Rosula was tempted to retort, and a little ashamed that a mere child managed to agitate her so. But - could it be true? Her doubts began to set in. Had Father Andreas mentioned anything about a Servant&#39;s sight? She was aware that each of them came from legends, or were otherwise famous or notorious in their own time. But what exactly were they capable of?

From what little contact she&#39;d had with this self-proclaimed Servant, the only things she had learned were that they were incredibly ravenous, and incredibly brittle.

&#39;You don&#39;t seem very impressed,&#39; the child suggested. They absentmindedly pushed their food around the plate, but it was apparent that they were far more interested in Rosula at the moment.

Frustratingly, Rosula grabbed the glass of water and took a drink from it herself. &#39;Do forgive me for not being very impressed,&#39; she echoed the child&#39;s words, &#39;But you stumbled into my garden half-dead, and now you claim to be a Servant. I don&#39;t even know who or what you are.&#39;

&#39;For starters, you can call me <em><strong>Ruler</strong></em>.&#39;

&#39;Ruler?&#39; Odd choice for a name. Who were their parents? &#39;What about your family name?&#39;

&#39;Ruler is my <em>Class</em>, silly.&#39; The child who called themselves Ruler seemed rather amused by Rosula&#39;s reaction. They even set down their spoon. &#39;Of course, I can&#39;t tell you my <em>real</em> name right now. It could be dangerous.&#39;

&#39;Dangerous how?&#39; 

Though she could understand every word Ruler had uttered, Rosula had trouble putting them all together. What danger could there possibly be in telling her their name?

&#39;Hasn&#39;t Father Andreas explained it already?&#39;

Again with the priest. Truthfully, he might have. But he had also told her a billion other things in the span of a single phone call. 

Abruptly, Ruler nodded, cutting through Rosula&#39;s reverie. &#39;Father Andreas left out quite a bit, then. You aren&#39;t familiar with magecraft at all, I take it.&#39;

It wasn&#39;t framed as a question.

Rosula felt Ruler&#39;s unnerving gaze on her, even though their features were barely visible in the uncanny darkness under their hood. &#39;No. I am not.&#39;

&#39;Naturally, you cannot grasp the gravity of the situation you have placed yourself in.&#39;
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1084186880553267330 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1084186880553267330><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 11, 2023 12:51 PM">12:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;What do you mean?&#39; The nun asked in spite of herself. So she didn&#39;t know the first thing about mages and their hand tricks. So what?

&#39;As an overseer of the Holy Grail War, your task is to shelter the Masters who forfeit, and punish those who break the rules. In other words, you are a mediator. Do you know what happens to mediators in wars? They are usually the first to get killed.&#39;

Now that the child had regained their vigor, Rosula&#39;s attention was no longer focused on their wellbeing, but rather their other prominent feature: their voice. She began to take note of their inflection, the self-assuredness of their words. No ten-year-old child carried themselves with such certainty. Surely not to the point where she had begun to question her own experience, or the lack thereof.

It was all deeply frustrating. Father Andreas had reassured her that he and his colleague would take care of everything once they arrived. Was that all a lie? Had she, along with her church, been scammed?

&#39;Don&#39;t worry, Sister.&#39; Ruler seemed to read her mind. &#39;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. The Grail called me forth to ensure the Holy Grail War proceeds without a hitch. In that, your and my goals are one and the same. Though I&#39;m no one&#39;s Servant, I can still be <em>your</em> Servant. Just for you, an exception. To make sure that same cliched fate of the mediators doesn&#39;t befall you.&#39;

&#39;...That is very noble of you,&#39; Rosula commented, not entirely convinced. At her age, it was hard to be convinced of anything by words alone.

&#39;It&#39;s a necessity,&#39; Ruler corrected her. &#39;My circumstances...they inconvenience me. I need your help, just as you will soon need mine. It&#39;s a win-win situation, really. Plus,&#39; they fell silent for a moment, as if hesitating, then said, &#39;Don&#39;t you want a Servant of your own?&#39;

I don&#39;t even know the first thing about magecraft.&#39;

&#39;What you have is a mother&#39;s scent.&#39;

The peculiarity of Ruler&#39;s remark unsettled her. Instinctively, she reached for the pendant under her robes.

&#39;Three pastors and five nuns run this church, but when Father Andreas&#39; letter arrived, you were the first to volunteer.&#39;

How well she remembered. &#39;What of it?&#39;

&#39;You wanted this role.&#39;

&#39;I wanted to help,&#39; she explained feebly. &#39;The others, they weren&#39;t too interested and I thought I&#39;d pitch in.&#39;

&#39;Have you ever wondered how the Grail chooses their Masters?&#39; Ruler said cryptically. &#39;Only mages can be chosen, that is true. But there are plenty of lousy mages out there. Weak, incompetent, barely able to cast a single action spell. But they still became Masters despite their lack of strength. Not dissimilar to how you still became the mediator of the War, despite your lack of knowledge. The War has never been about qualifications. It has always been about you, each and every one of you. You have a wish, Sister Rosula, and I can grant that wish for you.&#39;

&#39;I don&#39;t have a wish.&#39; But even as she protested, Rosula knew it was untrue. Ruler had driven her into a corner in a few brazen exchanges, stirring up a flurry of emotions and memories that had been lying dormant all these years. Her soul had been rejuvenated upon the sight of the helpless child under the stray cats&#39; assault. Her innate desire to nurture and to protect had been rekindled, compelling her to carry the child into the sanctum of the church. She had unknowingly invited them into her heart, and now she cared too much to let go.

The things she could have done. The things she could still do for the child in front of her. His image overlapped with the child&#39;s, the vivid imagination of her mind conjuring up his grown-up features and imprinting them on the dark canvas under Ruler&#39;s hood. Perhaps it was for this precise reason that Ruler had concealed their face all this time, but Sister Rosula was already too invested to see through their ruse. Her heart ached with the weight of her unfulfilled wishes. 

But.

&#39;But what of it?&#39; She asked again. &#39;Yes, sure, it&#39;s as you said. I can&#39;t deny that I&#39;ve been curious. About the Holy Grail War, and the Holy Grail. But even if that&#39;s true, there&#39;s nothing for me here. So stop tempting me. I&#39;m glad you care, but I can&#39;t become a Master. I&#39;m just a nun, child. Please, do not give me false hope.&#39;

Ruler got up from their chair and reached across the table, their blackened hands leaving cinder dust on the table cloth as they cupped Rosula&#39;s hand in their own.

&#39;Not the Grail,&#39; they squeezed Rosula&#39;s fingers, &#39;But me. I can make your wish come true.&#39;

Rosula waited. What was she even expecting?

&#39;There are two parts to your wish: to reunite with your son, and to punish the men who took your son away. The second part is easy, while the first part is tricky.&#39;

&#39;But it can still be done?&#39; The Ruler child knew too much, but Rosula no longer cared.

&#39;What do you take the Holy Grail for?&#39; Ruler crept closer, and a faint gleam of red flickered under their hood. &#39;Anything can be done if we have enough resources to spare. Erasure. Fabrication. Preservation. Anything you want.&#39;
