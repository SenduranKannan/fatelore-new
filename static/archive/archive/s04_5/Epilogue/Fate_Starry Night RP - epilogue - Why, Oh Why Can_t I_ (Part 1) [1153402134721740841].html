The aroma from the salty sea aided in the pleasant atmosphere that the sunny day provided. Callings from birds flying nearby added to the sounds that carried upon the winds. It was almost perfect.

To think it was merely a couple days ago after the whole encounter at the Church.

Through what connections he had left, James secured a passage back home. It wasn’t something he was actually planning on using but here he was.

His arms rested on the guardrail while his fingers held onto the rim of a glass filled with a nice whiskey. The contents were already down to a shot or two left. His muscles still ached with every movement he made; a constant reminder of the strain he forced himself through just to reach the finish line. 

Not only that, but the damage to his shin made walking almost too much of a herculean task to do, without the use of a cane, of course. Something he refused to bring along out of pure stubbornness.

How long has it been since he was on these very same waters heading to Berenice? It felt like forever ago. The mere act of giving his body a chance to relax was almost too foreign for him to get used to. There would be no more attempts on his life nor fear that someone would come for him if he happened to close his eyes at the wrong moment, at least, that’s what he hopes, of course.

Just how close was death’s door for him? How close did the reaper’s scythe come to touching his neck? A morbid thought to be smiling about but he smiled nonetheless.

“Just hold out a little longer now…” His words were nothing more than a whisper as he stared at his reflection on the water. Was he speaking to himself or hoping his daughter heard him? Both were likely answers. However, neither would be confirmed by the man himself, leaving it up to the world to decide instead.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn’t so much about mystery as it was novelty: new experiences that were to present themselves to her, things that she never had the chance to experience in life.  Both the sort that were simply withheld from her for her position, or that had yet to exist.

The one that had proven the most novel thus far, only two days into the former fool’s new life, was that of the boat and the way it moved.  Not its propulsion…but how it rocked upon the waves, back and forth, back and forth…

Triboulet had never gone on the sea in her life.  Hell, she had never been to the sea before; Paris was far inland.

Nicolette, having seen it for the first time with their arrival to the pier in the morning, had expressed a quiet admiration for it.  Now, she cursed it with all of the vim and vigor that dwelled in her heart.  Her human heart…

…set in her all-too-human body.  Pristine, ageless, and prone to the same idiosyncracies as anyone else.  New experiences, like seasickness, were never necessarily a good thing.

She announced her presence with a groan as she walked down the aisle.  Her hand gripped the railing tightly, and her face was taut with an attempt to compose herself, but at the very least she was past the worst of it.  This had been the first time she’d left the comfort of their berth, and she was upright under her own power!

“I’m glad to see you’re dealing with…this…in such confident fashion,” Nicolette said.  The ‘this’ could’ve meant the catharsis that came from what they had just escaped from, but it was probably the boat ride.  “To think the Greeks were setting about this sea in bundles of wood…many centuries before I came.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1153402408643346554 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1153402408643346554><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 18, 2023 1:49 PM">1:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She rested against the railing, mirroring him (and bracing herself further) as she looked out into the glittering mid-day Mediterranean.

Beyond the inconveniences of the moment and her concern for his injuries, Ms. Ferrial was unabashedly happy.  Things just didn’t seem dull in the same way they used to, and the way she carried herself - not as a performance of pantomime this time - showed James the image of someone who was enjoying themselves for the first time in ages.

Nicolette looked up at him, and his tired face, and she smiled.  “Nervous?  Eager?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A short smirk was done at the sight of the now-human Servant experiencing life anew. 

“Call it experience.” Was his answer before he took a sip from his drink, savouring the taste as it went down smoothly. A scoff took the place of a chuckle while his gaze returned to the reflection before. “Yeah, if all the Greeks needed was some oars and good faith, I’m sure you can survive a little seasickness.”

The sight of true joy from Nicolette was a welcome one after seeing her wearing that mask of hers since the start. It brought a shine to his rather tired expression, even despite all the hours of sleep he caught up on. The strain from the Grail War was simply that great.

“I think I’m still in shock. Like all it will take is just a good shake then I’m back in that upstairs room again.” The man allowed his head to drop and hang for a bit while a long exhale left him before he continued. “Wouldn’t that be a cruel joke, huh? Dream of the perfect ending only for it to be just that; a dream.”

Would he have the strength to repeat those actions again? The sores and aches on his body screamed the answer at him with a resounding ‘no!’ spoken through pain. It was at least a reminder that this wasn’t a dream, though. That blow from Ruler’s Master still had him limping despite his Healing Magecraft. Any offer of a walking cane to help was declined for fear of seeming older than he already was. Stubborn bastard.

“But, to actually answer your question, I feel as if a huge weight left my shoulders.” James stared up at the blue sky. The world seems more colourful lately now that he was able to take it in for once. “It feels like forever since I could just relax and not worry about wasting whatever time I had left to save her. I feel… relieved.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She mirrored his word, and looked up herself.  A passing flight of migratory birds hung above in the far distance, flying back to where they had just left.  Egypt was going to be a part of her life that held regret as much as relief, even for how brief it had been, and she could imagine some part of her…

…well, obviously some part of her was lost in their time together, otherwise she’d not be here.  But perhaps something more immaterial than the state of her being.  Not innocence, she had quite possibly never had that.

It would be another 91 years before she understood exactly what that was.

She almost reached out to stretch her arms, but regretted leaving the comfort of the rail almost immediately and latched back on like a monkey on a branch.

“I know you…care much for her,” she said after a pause, “but is that all you want to do from now on?  Be a father?  For the remainder of your life.”  Not much of a remainder, she would’ve said a few days prior.  “There must be at least a little else.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What did he want to do? The answer that she got was nothing more than a slow chuckle. His head dropped to face the water once more as he shook his head. 

“Sorry. It’s just that I have never thought about that, even for a second, after all of these years.” It was such a realization to him that he couldn’t help but to laugh about it. To think that his mind was so focused on the present that he never gave the future the light of day.

Before he spoke again, he gave the question some proper thought. His eyes opened a bit once the idea crossed his mind. Right. He did have that place back home. “You know, I opened up a small spa back home. It was fairly popular when it was open. When my daughter got too sick though, I had to put it on hiatus so I could focus my time on her instead.”

“Most people didn’t know I used my Magecraft to enhance their experience so that allowed my place to stick out.” He stared at his hand before grasping the air a few times. Some practice to ensure he can still properly control the temperature would be smart, seeing how he used it these past months with little to no restraint. “Beyond that, I don’t have an idea on what I’ll do. Maybe I will find that out now that I am given the chance to.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It took a moment, but soon after he mentioned ‘spa’, she was chuckling to herself - even during his own reminiscence over the illness of his daughter.

“Oh, please, James,” she looked up at him with smug disbelief, “a masseuse?  That’s it?  I’ve imagined a magus as the sort to go about building their little empires or locking themselves in a room to study without end.”  Her free hand rose up and writhed with ill intent.  “But a fine magus such as yourself, he takes people into a room prone and rubs his grubby mitts all about their backsides.  Ha!”

She shook her head…whoever would be with this woman in the future better be the sort with thick skin and an even temper.  Though, if you’ve gone this long with her, James, maybe you just enjoy the pain.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A bold move for sure, given her state a few moments ago. Surely this wouldn’t end badly, and with a mess on the deck, right?

The amount of roughhousing and teasing brought upon by his late wife toughened him up it would seem. Otherwise, there was no chance in hell that he would be able to handle someone like his Servant without cracking day one. A parting gift in disguise? Nah, just merely a coincidence is all it was. A welcome one at that, though.

“I apologize if I lack the grandiose dreams of Magi families. Those ambitions ended with my parents. I never shared such dreams. So, as sad as it may be to hear, you already know my ambitions. Better than anyone else, I may add.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She sounded, briefly, a little wistful - but she dismissed that notion as she bravely stepped from the sea to the other end of the walkway, where a pair of old metal chairs, worn by the salty air, sat next to a small bolted-in table.  The woman took a seat…facing away from him.

“Prove it, if you please.  All of this seasickness is driving a crook about my shoulders.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Consider this a taste and relax, alright?” It was a bit of a challenge on his part. He was more used to having more of his patient’s back exposed but he had to make due with just the shoulders to work with.

A gentle touch came from his hands when they touched her shoulders. Although they appeared rough on the surface, they carried with them over a decade of experience in comforting others through the skills of being a masseur. Quickly, they went to work on the areas where he felt she was the most tense. The pressure…could use some work but the rust was being shaken off as the massage went on.

Finding one’s pressure points was no issue for the man. This skill, unlike his skills as a masseur, was still being used during their time in the Holy Grail War against his opponents, which meant, even if it was just in her shoulders, any crooks or knots were unable to remain hidden from his nebulous gaze.

“Let me know if the heat is too much.” What he meant by that became clear mere moments after as his hands began to warm up to add heat into the massage. He did his best to ensure that the heat wasn’t enough to be uncomfortable, or harmful, but kept at a careful temperature instead. While others could use other means to replicate this, James, being able to moderate the temperature to one’s personal preference, could do this on the spot while targeting one’s key points. Sure it was cheating compared to others, but who’s really going to complain about that during the massage?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was only a few feet away, and though she felt the ocean striking back at her for the primeval transgression that is being French she was able to get in place before its worst effects could take a hold of her.

“Go on,” she said to his declaration, “do as you will.  Mayhaps some earlier transgression will bring my own dream to an end - it wouldn’t be too much to...snap…”

She had more morbid things to say, but the initial touch came and she felt no compulsion to continue.  At first, it was painful - the muscles up there had been seemingly formed taut, as strange as the thought was - and she winced, inching forward and away from his continued touch.  She was prepared to comment on this, another barb along the lines of ‘Forget snapping my neck, you’ll make me wish I was dead!”, but his continued work kept her quiet.

Just a little later, and she was made comfortable.  The tension was drawn to attention and then discarded, her tiny frame sagging down and forward in relaxation.  Nicolette’s eyes closed, and her breathing slowed.  Just by going over the muscles of her shoulders, it seemed like she had just as much built-up stress as her former Master did - past all that bravado and masochism, of course.  She must’ve been quite quite good at masking it.

Her posture still left something to be desired, though.  Getting this close and running his hands down her spine, feeling the curve and how its surrounding muscles weren’t what was pulled taut, it seemed as if it wasn’t just a slouch but an real hunchback.  Admittedly minor.  Probably not the sort of thing that can be fixed with just massages.

She let him talk and explain, and the addition of unnatural heat was silently welcomed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1153403073746698351 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1153403073746698351><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 18, 2023 1:52 PM">1:52 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Nicolette was content to let this transpire for a while, silently - the motor of the boat, the seabirds and their cries, and the beating of waves and wind against the hull were a pleasant sound to listen to in lieu of a friend.

No words were spoken about it though. It was a silent understanding. So, to him at least, it made sense to help relieve her of it since she relieved him of the weight upon his shoulders. Renewed purpose flowed into his hands. If that was the case then there was little reason to half-ass this massage.

His hands went further down, trying to cover as much area as he could, which is when he figured out that her whole hunchback deal wasn’t just for theatrics. While he wasn’t able to fix it at the moment, he could, however, still provide her with an excellent massage. 

What would have taken a good session or so of probing to find the points needed for the masseur to work with, James’ skillful eyes allowed him to put precise pressure using his thumbs on those points already. This, coupled with his heated hands, dug deep to those more stubborn knots, even despite her hunchback.

At this point, it would be fair to say that James got into groove once again, realising again why this was his passion he spent so long mastering. Though it may be considered a small act to some, it was something a lot more to him.

“Hmm. What would I do if I was given a second life and a new world to explore…” His gaze almost met with hers once she glanced over her shoulder. Fortunately, his eyes drifted towards her back. The colour of his eyes were still able to be seen. 

“Let me see. I have a feeling you want to become a wandering thespian, travelling around Europe to perform all manner of plays and shows.” While his tone still had issues with portraying proper sarcasm, the smile on his face did the job in portraying just fine. “Call it a lucky guess, but I feel like you would be a natural at that.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Close.”

“I don’t know if I trust anyone in such a fashion.  I’m…I’m fine standing outside and looking in for that way of knowing someone.  Maybe someday, but it will…take time.”

The real answer was something she had entertained a while ago, and eventually decided upon quietly.  To her, from the perspective of a hero of the world, it sounded like the worst way to go about things.  To a simple human being?  It was fine.  It had been sitting in her gut now for an uncomfortable amount of time, and she wanted to simply acknowledge it.  Ease the anticipation.

When Nicolette finally spoke up in full, she spoke with a lilted tone that would normally be reserved for her terrible punchlines: “Mayhaps I’d take the time to spend in your family?”

A very funny idea, that.  Except she didn’t laugh, and she didn’t follow it up.  Nicolette sat as still as a rock.  The sickness in her stomach grew in power, even while immobile.

It took her a bit to explain herself.  “...You remember…Blanche.  I doubt you would forget it; it’s one of the few times I’ve been honest with you.”  Now she kept her voice quiet enough to almost fall under the noise of the waves.  “That child of mine, she was one of the few things to ever, ever make me happy.  And I can’t have her back.”

“I can’t ever see her again.”  She turned her head down to her feet.  “I’ve…”

She inclined, and though she had spoken it out in full, she still felt as if her insides were burning - shame, anticipation, the fear of rejection.  Rejection…

“I can’t be a…I cannot be a wife for you, James.  I love you, but as one loves a…close friend.  It would be, and it is so improper for me to impose this upon you.

There were very few moments that gave him such a pause during their stressful time together. With his hands on her back, he felt the tension that this brought for her. Besides the lack of her usual joking tone, it was his way of knowing that this request was genuine.

As she sat like a rock, he ensured that the tension did not linger for long, at least on her body, as if silently giving her the push needed to continue with her words; to find that strength within. Not that she needed it, of course. It was merely a kind gesture one could give is all it was.

“Despite that, I’m sure she was still happy, for whatever that’s worth to hear, from one parent to another.” There was no changing what happened all those years ago. No magical trick or spell was enough to change a moment in one’s life like that. He doubted even the Grail could, even given all of its power.

Then she got to the point about his own daughter. There he remained silent while listening to her speak. The only thing ensuring her of his presence was the heat and comfort of his hands. Any words might have helped with that fear of rejection but none would come out of James. No. He was focused more on listening than he was thinking of what would be best to say in this situation.

The silence lingered around them for a while, causing the air to become heavy the longer it remained. Fortunately, it would not stay for much longer.

The tension was cut, or attempted at least, further by his chuckling again. “Although, you say that now, you haven’t experienced the full course of one of my massages yet. I had a few confess their love afterwards, after all.” A sigh finished off his chuckle, hoping it did something to the tension.

“You would be giving plenty already, though. For one, you’ll be granting the chance for Aveline to grow up with a mother by her side. If I were to focus time on finding someone to fill that role, time I would rather spend with Aveline instead mind you, it would take years to find someone. With you, there would be no waiting at all.” Could it be?

“I trusted you with my life. Trusting you with my future is but a small step to make beyond that.” How much longer could one dance around confirming with a yes at this point? The answer was clear, might as long get it out! “If you would do me the honours, I’m sure both of us would love to welcome you into our family. She’s a nice girl.

Triboulet had been an enigma with how vociferously she tried to portray her stage persona and her pent-up anger as the totality of her personality.  His only experience with this vulnerable side of her had been brief and…somewhat unpleasant.  A soft hand would have to be employed.

She didn’t laugh at his joke, even unconsciously pulling away from his hands for a start when confessing love came up.  James had worked the backs of enough people to tell that drawing the shoulders together, pulling them up, was a plain sign of discomfort.

The long build up, the justification that made the choice she presented seem like one with an obvious answer, ended with a similarly stony silence.

Maybe it was the sudden outpouring of emotions not lifting her up, but instead suffocating her as they flowed from her mouth.  This was Triboulet, after all.
Maybe it was the massage, even - being this physically close to someone in a positive way had been closed off to her, and maybe that was making her more affected than usual.  It was really something when you think about it; being almost crushed to death underneath a bleeding Archer was, perversely, the closest she came to a sort of tactile intimacy before.

Despite being the one to bring it up in the first place, Nicolette was the one to stymie this decision.  “Perhaps I shouldn’t have…forgive me.

He wanted it to be done in a way where it didn’t appear like it was because of her. It didn’t take some special eyes or decades of experience to realize that she had plenty enough on the mind. Adding on another thing would be unfair to her.

He may have still got his touch with massaging but it would appear that he has long since lost his touch with women as well. Figures, honestly.

A soft sigh left him as he patted the back of her chair before leaving the spot behind her to take the other chair across from her. He turned it to face the ocean. He gave her the time to speak her piece while he got comfortable. His hand reached for a small box of smokes before setting it on the table. Before he would light one up, he would prefer to see if it was alright from her first before causing her further discomfort with the smoke.

“I’m not sure why, if I am being honest.” James sat with his elbows on his legs and his hands together. His gaze was set upon the floor but it was clear that his focus was beyond that. “You know, it may not mean much now, but I tried to distance myself from you at the start because I was afraid.” If there was any moment to get this off his chest, it would be now.

I thought if I saw them as a tool, it would make losing them easier should that come to pass. But, you never made it easy. From the start, it was difficult not to see you as a person. Someone larger than life stuck with someone like me. It was only when I learned more about you was when I realized how wrong I was. Summoned or not, you were just another person like anyone else.” A soft chuckle formed a smile on his face. The chuckle was directed at his past self for such a foolish line of thought. “For what it’s worth, Nicolette, I truly am sorry. I know it may not carry much weight now but I am.”

“Listen, how about we do this instead? We both give this more thought before deciding whether or not to do this. We have a couple of days before we reach the port. That is plenty of time for both of us to really sit on this decision. At the very least, if you decide against it, I can provide you with a good amount of currency, seeing how I wouldn’t need to pay for medical bills anymore, to let you live comfortably for a while. That is non-negotiable, however. Sounds good?” His head turned towards her to see her reaction, being more than careful to avoid accidental eye contact. God he regretted not bringing a spare.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Grinding up dried leaves and burning them was a concept past her time, but it didn’t take long for her to understand what it was.  He smoked it, a hundred passersby in Berenice did as well, and she was either fine with it or inured to its acrid smell.

“...Do as you please.”

She leaned forward.  Free of his gentle touch, even in these dire emotional straits, she tested her arms with the hint of a back-and-forth push to see how much work five minutes of massaging did.  More limber than she imagined.

With hands like these, why even become a magus?

The man seemed like the consummate image of one when she first met him, even if she was only going off of the hints of the Throne.  Francis I was too pious to invite mystics to the court, and thus her knowledge was limited.  Concerned with victory at the cost of complete apathy towards every other living thing, unkind at best, malicious at worst.  Aristocrats of a cruel system.

The other magi she had seen served to further that perception - whether they sat at the sidelines, uncaring as their beasts killed people en masse as per Berserker and the other Assassin, or they were simply right bastards, as per those assholes named Lachlan, Illyn.  Lancer’s old man was a cockhead, even if he held up his end of the bargain.  Saber’s Master, she never got the opportunity to show her bad side if she had one…poor woman.  God rest her soul.

Where did James Rellum go wrong to stand outside the mold and start having some level of a conscience?  More than her own, even?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1153403814204936235 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1153403814204936235><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 18, 2023 1:54 PM">1:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Nicolette snuck a glance at him.  How he spoke, talking of a moment to let her consider everything, it made her wonder if the others would’ve even considered him a true magus by any measure of quality.  He heated up things, he was born with special eyes, he made little surveillance knick-knacks, and most of all, he was far too sentimental.  

That wasn’t much a big realization.  He carried around a stuffed rabbit, for Christ’s sake.

He couldn’t have just ordered her to make a choice or leave.  That would’ve been easier…but, after all, she had given up that simple relationship they had, as Master and Servant, of her own free will.

From hereon, they’d have to figure out what that would look like in the future.  Distant friends or strange, live-in nanny…that was the question at hand.  And the one she’d have to answer soon.

She did not speak in regards to his apology, but to his offer, she had an answer.  Her retrospection, his respect of her space and the moments of quiet that he had given her, those had managed to talk her down from that emotional cliff she was standing on.

“I owe you that much.”  She nodded.  Whether through solidarity or just ill-timed impulse, she reached for the cigarette packet on the table to take one for her own, though James would have to light it.  “I’ve waited a long time to have this opportunity, I figure.  A week or two to…orientate myself, and find the most sensible of paths…that is not a very long time.”

“...there’s not many others in history who’ve sat in my position, I imagine” she chuckled to herself hollowly.  “Excuse my indecision.  I’m charting new ground in the field of how best to waste one’s life.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The smoke trailed into the air before two puffs were done to ensure it remained lit despite the breeze. 

“I’m sure I wouldn’t really know what to do if I was given the same chance myself, so you’re excused.” A short chuckle was done before he reached to place his two fingers on the end of hers, keeping them there until he was sure it was lit as well. “Well, in my experience, as long as you enjoy life to some degree, it can’t really be considered wasted now can it?”

Sure, one can regret. One can lament. One can curse. All of it directed at various points in life, but James truly believed that a life one enjoyed is one well-spent. Though, seeing how he was just going through the one life, his words had to be taken with a grain of salt. 

A few drags of the cigarette were done to fill in the silence some, exhaling the smoke into the air above his head. The smooth flavour was something he missed after his pack was stolen.

“Regardless of what may be your decision in the end, I want to say thank you.” Suddenly, the man brought out gratitude towards her. His gaze still set to the ceiling where he blew the smoke out to. “For everything, I mean. This poor dropout of a magus wouldn’t be sitting here on his way back home otherwise. Either dead in that alleyway or barely being able to see the finish line, let alone cross it.”

“I’ll give you some time to yourself. If you need me, I will be resting in the room.” With a groan because of his shin, James got up and pocketed the cigarette box. A comforting pat was placed upon her shoulder in place of parting words as the man limped down into the hallway.

If she accepted, as unlikely as it felt at that moment, it meant she would have to take care of a self-destructive man as well as a child.

Her lungs didn’t immediately agree with her choice to start smoking.  Nicolette’s dignity was preserved as she kept the coughing to a minimum, just a little thumping on her chest to get it under control.  It was an exotic practice, but she imagined that her friend must’ve practiced for years to keep his own fits down.

Unfortunately, aside from a couple more abortive attempts in the coming months, it would be another 43 years before she smoked again.  She’d have to find other ways to connect with James.

Nicolette got up after he had left, and stood at the railing for another hour without him.  There were many things to think about, decisions to be made…and it was a very long way to go home.  Fight her as it may, the sea would be a better companion for this discussion than the awkward silence of their berth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
