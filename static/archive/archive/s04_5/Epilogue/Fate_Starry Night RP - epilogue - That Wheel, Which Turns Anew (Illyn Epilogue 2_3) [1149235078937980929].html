The exact number was likely stored within IBM’s database, within the mind of the original Illyn Mariston, who had copied himself into IBM in an attempt to recreate his wife.

His wife… No, not his any longer. That memory was not one for him to partake in.

Yet this journey had to be made. It was fitting that it’d be his final stop on the small island town of Berenice. She had begun his journey, and she would conclude it. That was only right. Kill the past, kill all but one connection, and he would return as a new man. A man who was not shackled by the confines of his predeccesors. 

He had claimed it, multiple times. He had claimed it before Laplace. He had claimed it before Christopher. He had claimed it before Triboulet, and James. He had claimed it before Evi, before her corpse vanished into dust.

Thus he trekked up the hill, using his Thunderclap as a walking cane. IBM existed as a Walkman in his pocket, to minimize any inconvenience. The trail was near the end of Berenice’s graveyard, where a hilly area had been reserved for old families who wished to be plotted together. Berenice was not very large, however, and many of these plots were vacant.

He walked up the hill. He sweated. It would’ve been easy to simply Reinforce his legs, Reinforce his body, and Reinforce his mind as he made the long journey. Yet that would defeat the purpose. Illyn <em>reveled</em> in this labor. 

It was the one labor he would finally do. A true and final sendoff.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1159644751797162135 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1159644751797162135><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 5, 2023 7:14 PM">7:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Then, he saw it.

Her tombstone.

It was only half-complete, with the left side being a marble coffin that had a pedestal built around it. It rose up into the sky, with a statue of a woman on it. The entire coffin was covered in moss and flowers, having been worn by time. It had been accepted by nature

The right side was empty, and not complete. Another coffin was supposed to be there, Illyn’s. After he died, it was to complete their coffin. Life through death, overcoming their separation into eternity. A noble gesture which likely resulted in many similar graves popping up all over the world.

Illyn looked down at the inscription.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Evi Mariston, 1966 - 1989</code>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">No Matter What Happens, I Will Always Exist</code>

“We, now they, had a good life.” Illyn murmured, before producing IBM and clicking a button.

The other side of the grave began to rapidly construct itself, as if a completed schematic had been stored in it from long ago. It rapidly built itself up, before Illyn’s statue completed itself, standing next to Evi’s.

Using nature Magecraft learned by Alice, Illyn used IBM to replicate the moss and flowers growing on Evi’s half so that they covered Illyn’s as well. That was how it should be. When Illyn had first scanned himself into IBM, he should’ve died. He didn’t, but this felt right.

Huh. ‘Right’. Emotions like these had no use in an experiment, but were valuable here.

Illyn modified the inscription with basic Magecraft.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Evi Mariston, 1966 - 1989</code>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">No Matter What Happens, I Will Always Exist</code>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Illyn Marison, 1964 - 2000</code>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">If That’s True, Then My Arms Will Always Be Open</code>

Illyn turned to walk away, only to stop after taking several paces. There was plenty of area to this plot, and this was the final time he’d ever come here. Why not make the most of it? This was the most efficient use for this area.

Besides, this felt ‘right’.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1159644804901253202 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1159644804901253202><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, October 5, 2023 7:14 PM">7:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Leaning down, Illyn manifested a plaque onto the ground. From there, he wrote Laplace’s Equation. Then, he printed a larger plaque on top of that one. He suspected that Laplace’s Demon would find the notion amusing. Besides, it wasn’t a true grave. Laplace’s Demon was still out there. He was not dead.

Illyn would find him.

Returning to the larger plaque, Illyn modified it into a circular shape, leaving a hollow center. There, he placed flowers with Alice’s Magecraft. A flower that would spread its seeds, wither, die, grow, bloom, then spread its seeds again. A cycle. A wheel.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Sri Kalki</code>
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">The Savior That None Will Meet</code>

Rider. Sri Kalki. The Servant that Illyn had not wanted. The Servant that Illyn had despised. Now, he only had a mild longing, for. His Noble Phantasm had saved Illyn. He, despite his hatred of the man, had saved Illyn. Kalki and Laplace, working together, had saved the world.

Yet Kalki had gotten left behind.

It was cruel.

Yet there was nothing to be done about it.

Suddenly, the Walkman <em>squawked</em> as its speaker activated.

The static in his voice had been clear with a sense of groggy awakening, as though the entire time, he had simply been asleep. And had Illyn paid more attention, he’d hear how as if tuning itself to a station, his voice slowly became more clear.

“And it seems you will be coming towards what is another part of your cycle, Illyn.”

His voice had remained the same throughout the war, Kalki’s normal tone of what could be described as infuriating smoothness, and yet a goading to it, as a teacher would have taught an impatient student, someone hungry for an answer yet could not craft the algorithm to get it. He knew it was such a thing that he’d have to acknowledge, and yet Sri Kalki wanted to hear a confirmation. He waited a moment, as if he would have expected a response from the Widower.

“It seems to have been quite the eventful Grail War. Hopefully as you are able to accept this a lot more than this one. . .”

He had refereneced to exactly what would have been the elephant in the room. For, his original servnt hadn’t been always in IBM, but rather, thanks to Illyn and his With such a master of your liking, surely you can tell me you’ve won.”

Again he waited. Had he not been watching? Had he not seen what had laid in store from his passing to his possession? How his body had been infested with the new knowledge of Laplace’s Demon, or what concluded after that? The Incarnation chuckled at himself.

“For it’d be quite a shame to go through this effort to have lost.”

And it would have been more than that. The hellish war he had to experience with his master was something only few would have stomached, and even though he had been someone who was bound to see the worst, it was during this war he felt the most detached from what he could have seen as humanity. Another lengthy pause occurred, this time, longer than the others. 

“Well? Tell me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This wasn’t real. This was a hallucination. Illyn was simply stressed from the Holy Grail War. The box didn’t talk. It couldn’t talk. After all, it had nothing to…

“...replicate.” Illyn held his hand to his mouth.

There were a lot of ghosts coming back to haunt him today. First Rosula, then Evi, now Kalki. Why were they hounding him, now? Illyn’s sins were heavy, but today specifically, they threatened to crush him. There were few things from this Holy Grail War in which Illyn believed redemption was warranted. His treatment of Sri Kalki, however, was one of them.

A Servant he did not want, who had been summoned to a Master he himself had hated. Yet, in the end, this act of fate was what saved Illyn. This act of fate let him meet Laplace. This act of fate, in a way, would save the world.

Save the world…?

A thought crossed Illyn’s mind. He chuckled quietly as Kalki continued to speak.

“It seems that the cycle of Holy Grail Wars has returned my Rider who protects the wheel.” Illyn smiled faintly. Kalki had been scanned into IBM during a moment of irrational rage. Now, he would be stuck there forever.

Then, it dawned. This was a Kalki scanned from before the battle with Assassin. He knew little of his fate. “Yes, we won. In a sense. We also lost, in a sense. I held the Holy Grail, Kalki. I <em>held</em> it. I wished upon it, then I freely gave it away.”

An odd thing to say. Illyn Mariston would’ve never said that before. He rarely even called his Servant by their True Name. Yet, the war was over. There was no need for titles or labels.

“How much do you remember?”

“A win and a loss? Well depending on how you go about this, I’ll determine which is greater than the other. So far however, it seems you turning the wheel on your own was futile, like I said.”

Ah, that same reference to life. Kalki had said it before, that life was like a wheel, something that continued in its pace until one learned from it, and not many would. Rather life would live and try to about itself, but each moment they experience would lead to the same road. It was this that he could see Illyn hated, and yet, it was something simply out of his control.

“But to give you an answer on that question, I remember Holmes. The boy with the sand, and the Noble Phantasm I deployed. Had I known that I’d have lost there, I’d have killed Holmes before such an could progress. . . But, it seems that life progressed like this for a reason.”

Even how he accepted this fate had such a sense of relaxing in it. Like though he were to have been killed from the beginning, it was just bound to happen. Then again, he <em>was</em> someone who had been once seen as the preserver god in his own myth. Regardless, there was little he could have done now anyways. So, he allowed the man to continue.

“Go on, what happened afterwards.”

Laplace and his formulas. Every Servant has some concept that they adhere to.” Illyn said, frowning. It wasn’t false. Illyn was being honest. Was this because of the nature of Heroic Spirits? Beings confined to containers that cannot contain their complete essence?

Were Servants the same as him before? Beings clawing desperately to maintain some semblance of identity by attaching themselves to a concept important to them? It warranted further study.

“You were right. I could not break the wheel.” Illyn’s admittance was something he had realized during the war. Saying it was a heavy admission. “But I also broke it. Through you. Your Saint Graph was taken over by Laplace’s Demon. Are you familiar with the concept? It’s a thought experiment used as a processor by Atlas. He took your Saint Graph. Your Class Name. You ceased to be.”

The wind rustled, and Illyn’s coat alongside it.

“You died. Not ‘you’, but another you. You failed to kill Holmes, and I died as a result. It seems we were both failures, until the end.” Illyn frowned. “Kalki, do you feel like a failure?”

Well, I guess that is too ironic, being possessed by the same thing that I protect.”

Illyn’s story was less believable than anything, yet Illyn hadn’t been known yet to tell something larger than small lies. Within the space of IBM Kalki could only press further for the questions, but Illyn’s question also had him pause there.

“Do I feel like a failure? Not that I know. Had I thought such, I’d be calling Lord Vishnu a failure too, and did he not hold the solar system in his maw? Did he not become Rama to defeat Ravana? Every hero has had trials that made them feel tested, yet I cannot say they ever felt like failures. At least, not that I feel within me. Why? Are you deeming yourself a failure?”

It wasn’t something Kalki would have done, to console his master in such a way, rather the servant simply questioned him. While Illyn would ruminate, he would continue speaking his thoughts on such a thing.

“And do not say you feel such for not changing what you humans call ‘fate’ because it is not something you are strong enough for. So, if you’re to say you’re a failure, it best be for something much more simple than that.”

I’m simply wondering if I’ve failed her. I’m standing at Evi’s grave right now” Illyn didn’t know if IBM included visual sensors. He could likely modify the device, but he had never expected the Mystic Code to work in such a way. “I’m me, but I’m not me. I feel like an avatar of Illyn B. Mariston, but I’m <em>not</em>. It’s a strange sensation, but I turned my back on her and myself.”

He had failed in his original goal. Did that make Illyn a failure? He didn’t know. He hadn’t failed before in anything that mattered. IBM had worked splendidly, his participation in the Holy Grail War had stumbled, but he had survived it. He had joined Atlas. This sensation… Was this failure?

Or something more?

“I’m pleased to know the Throne keeps you updated with French thought experiments.” Illyn smiled faintly. A joke? That was new. “I need to tell you something, Kalki. <strong>You were right.</strong>”

“Well, it seems that everything has worked accordingly then. You’ve learned something new…The wheel is unending. However, that does not mean you sit idly and twiddle your thumbs. You’ve failed, but plenty people <em>fail</em>. It is what makes Lord Vishnu preserve you all, to see how you make it from failing repeatedly.”

Words of wisdom seemed to come effortlessly, as if Illyn’s newfound answers had been widely received in open arms. 

“I will be honest with you Illyn, I have little to scold you over, but this war is not for those who stake their lives on the past. You participate in this war for a future, though predetermined. You say you’ve met Laplace’s demon, clearly a demon well suited in possessing this body of mine. Have you not learned anything special from him? Has such a being not shown you that everything is predestined?”

Small errors can create something truly grand. I have a suspicion you would despise Laplace’s Demon. The bastardization of the future is something I know you would never forgive.”

Vishnu… Illyn waited for the rage of Kalki to wash over him, but it never did. He wished that the avatar would demean and insult him for his crimes, as if that would give him meaning. It never came, and Illyn blinked away a wetness in his eyes.

“A scolding would be nice, but that’s just not the type of person you are, is it?” Illyn laughed dryly. “Pre-destined or no, I have figured out why you’ve been summoned. What event you were summoned to stop.”

Words rang out across the graveyard, though nobody would be there to hear it. These words were forbidden, not meant for anyone but Laplace’s Demon, Illyn Mariston, and now, Sri Kalki. Illyn spoke of many things, including what was to come.

He spoke for a long time, but it ended up being minimal.

“That is what we are trying to stop. Millions will die, and I suspect that by the end of it, you will never forgive me. Nonetheless, it is the path placed ahead. Will we walk it together?”

I guess you humans simply do that in order to make sense of things, but these are things that you are not to make sense of.”

The magus was right, from how he described the servant, Kalki could feel that it would be useless to talk to what could only be a walking formula made by human hands. Humans were arrogant, and foolhardy, so he could only wonder if the spawn of them were but the same as well. It had seemed too ironic if it were, like father like son. If he could shake his head in this lonesome space he could, showing how he’d pitied the fool, knowing all too well that the comment he said before stayed true.

Illyn went to tell him of what he had learned, each detail seemingly something that Kalki could only remain silent for, waiting for a moment of something to allow him to question it. But the more he explained, the more he could see what this entire hell of a war was for, from the beginning of summoning to now, everything had began to slowly piece itself into place.  Illyn’s admittance to the end brought the man from his silent stupor, trying to find an answer suitable for it all. So <em>this</em> was the Kali Yuga in this cycle, not death by fire, nor death by storm…<em>This</em>. 

“I have no choice but to walk it, I was summoned here because there was a cycle beginning to end, be it yours or the world’s. As the ‘Turner of the Wheel’, I can only hope that you and I will be able to turn it in time…But know, I am not here to stop this world’s conflicts, I am simply here to clean what must be cleaned before the cycle begins anew. Then after that, I’m sure I’ll be done with what was needed, and I’ll return to the throne. But for now, I shall walk with you then, until that day comes.”

Godhood never suited you anyways, and a true divinity would never know how to do something as mundane as prepare breakfast.” Illyn allowed a wry smile as he touched the surface of the gravestone. He looked up at the statues that were now there, and allowed a faint smile.

He had done horrible things. Terrible things. Things that would never wash away. Illyn would 
never be a hero. He simply did as his heart desired him.

As Kalki’s voice turned quiet through the speakers, Illyn put his hand on his hip. He mouthed a silent ‘<em>thank you</em>’ that Kalki would not be able to see or hear, before turning away from the grave. “<strong>It’s a shame that Illyn and Kalki died here. That reminds me… There’s one more thing I need to do before returning to Atlas.</strong>”

Illyn looked up at the sky.

“<strong>Kalki.</strong>”

Just as a chapter on life closed, a new one opened up. Just as a passion that had fueled him for centuries had faded and died, a new purpose had erupted before him. The two left the gravestones behind, with their whispers and past memories. That was a life and story for those who had died.

Yes, Illyn Mariston had fully died in that graveyard, but Illyn Mariston had also stepped out with an ally in tow.

It was oddly comforting, knowing he wouldn’t be alone for his search. He would find Laplace’s Demon again, and he would verify the nature of their experiment and purpose. Had they saved the world, or had they doomed it?

The wheel turned, and with it, new opportunities arose.

So Illyn and Kalki left that graveyard, with the former’s head held high. For the first time in his life…

…he didn’t look back.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
