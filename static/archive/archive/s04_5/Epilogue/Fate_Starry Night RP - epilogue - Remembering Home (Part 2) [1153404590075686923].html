No adverse weather to cause the trip to turn for the worse, nor just to dampen the mood either. A simple solace after pouring out one’s heart. Whether it was a mistake to even bring up was yet to be seen. 

Unless she brought it up herself, James kept it a topic best left on the back burner for now. He saw no need to prod her for an answer if she didn’t already come to him with one. That additional pressure wasn’t something she needed right now, he understood that much, at least. Regardless of her answer, James would be ready for either outcome. He owed her that much as well.

The port they pulled into was small. Nothing too grandiose for one’s return home. There were people going on with their lives working and spending time alongside the various gangways. Merely just living life a day at a time.

With the pain, along with the requests from Nicolette, eventually forcing his hand, James succumbed to the fact that he needed to use the cane. Already he felt the years pour into his body, even if it was normal for someone to use one in his position. Though, despite all of his lamenting, he did not regret his decision that caused him that pain to begin with. There wasn’t any way he was going to merely stand by as Illyn suggested without being forced to.

It was surprising to say the least that they were willing to store his car for so long. They did advertise the service so it was mainly the fact that he would actually be returning for it that did most of the surprising if he was being honest.

The car wasn’t anything special. It was just a Fiat Punto with a deep velvet red finish on it. Ideal for a small family. A sad fact given what happened.

This left the final stretch to be done in a car to the next town over. The rolling Italian countryside was a heavy contrast to the sandy landscape of Egypt.

“How’re your thoughts on Italy so far?” Some small talk to help ease any anticipation wouldn’t hurt anyone. It was better than riding with just the engine running and the sound of the gravel road beneath the wheels. “I didn&#39;t think much of it when I first came here. But, just as I was told, it grew on me.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Beyond the buses from Berenice to the Mediterranean coast this was her first time in an automobile, and she found it…slightly confounding, how her view would be obscured by its form without craning her neck up to look out the window.  The humble horse had no such issue.

James certainly had the worst of the shame between the two with his cane, but for once, Nicolette seemed self-conscious about her height after he offered to purchase her a seat cushion to better see the world from.  Not that she declined.

Unobstructed, and far away from the port they had come from, Italy was a beautiful place.  In the temperate winter before the snowfall it seemed as if a green blanket covered every field, a quilt with white stitches of gravel roads intersecting it out to the horizon.  There were power lines hanging above and signs along the major roads, but looking at the worn stone buildings and the simpler life afforded to the country fellow, it didn’t seem all that foreign to her.

The familiarity was, at first, a comfort and a welcome change from the new sights of Egypt.  As her mind dwelled on it, the memory started to become more sour.

Her twilight years had been spent far away from the city, after all.  Some rural nowhere with people who barely understood her own tongue.

The beauty of the farmland of that time rarely hid the fact that, in exile, separated from the teeming urban mass she had always been a part of, she was astoundingly alone.

Nicolette was growing increasingly absorbed in those thoughts, and James’ idle question served well to pull her back into the current day.  She started with a “What?” before she took the time to understood what was said.  Looking outside, it seems the scenery had changed a good deal since she last paid attention.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A non-committal pushing aside.  Though, she continued.  “Quieter than Egypt.  Colder.  Though, if it’s as I remember, hearing old diplomats complain in the Court, it’ll be as hot as the Devil’s ass crack in the summer.”

She was prepared to let that be her estimation of the whole country, butts and all.  She continued to speak, as if her thoughts wouldn’t let her get off with a wisecrack and a dismissal.

“However…it’s also…better than I imagined.  Better than worn tapestries and gold-inlaid manuscripts crafted by put-upon clerics could depict.  Better than France and its cold winters, dangerous roads…”

“...and yet,” she looked back at him, eyebrow raised, “you’ve already shown me this area once before.  Remember?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Having grown up in England, he can attest to that statement to the summers here. “Fortunately, I had an AC system installed so we can keep that damned heat out for the most part. It was expensive, but I would rather have lighter pockets than see Aveline suffering anymore than she needed to because of the heat.” 

While he didn’t mind the quiet car ride, he was still glad that the small talk was working, even if it was just somewhat. 

Her words of approval of the area were met with some soft nods back. “I’m sure France got better as well. I haven’t been but I would be surprised if the conditions haven’t improved a bit since.”

“Oh?” His gaze almost turned to face her before they were stuck onto the road again. A silent curse under his breath was done. He was fine with falling onto the ground from accidental eye contact if they were walking but driving was one of the last things he wanted to fall into his own Mystic Eyes’ effects during.

“Oh. Those green hills, huh?” James shook his head. “The only place I showed you from here was Aveline’s room. The place with the treehouse I showed you in that dream was from the place where I grew up. It was a little ways outside of London in the UK.” A few more bends and turns then they’ll arrive at the villa.

I saw no reason to stay. Besides, I heard some say it wasn’t just an accident. Never found out if it was or not, though. But, seeing how nothing came after us, I think it is safe to say it might have been just an accident.” Soon the villa came into view as they rounded the last bend before entering the open space for the drive-through.

“Aveline might enjoy a trip over there so maybe one day I’ll go back.” There was only one other car taking up space so James could lazily park without much issue. “That, however, is something to think about for another time. For now, though, we’re here.”

The villa may have been only one story in height, but it made up for it with its width instead. It definitely wasn’t a small, modest home like some of the worn stone buildings along the way here. The warm beige colour palette helped to make it feel more welcoming than anything. The touches of modernity stuck out like a sore thumb as a result, though, especially with the AC system by the side of the villa.

Despite arriving, James simply stared at the place. His hands were still on the wheel, unable to relax. The thought that was crossing his mind was obvious; what if it didn’t work?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nicolette had it in her to try to make fun of him, almost just as much for his sake as hers - showing him that she wasn’t in a bad state if she’s up to her usual nonsense - but she draws it short before it can be completed.  Her eyes drift back from him to the villa, and she doesn’t bother forcing herself to act merry.

“Nevermind.  I’m sure this place is as warm of a home as any.”  She shook her head, and the two of them had the same impasse.

Nicolette enjoyed her time with him, as Assassin and as his odd friend.  Going inside lead to a possibility that she just wouldn’t be able to be that close to him anymore, and to approach something that could cause pain is never easy.

As she stared at the little manor, though, she remembered something: she was Assassin, just a little bit ago.  When did fear stop that woman?  She was more hesitant to walk into a building than to fight a dragon…

“This is stupid.”  She grumbled, undid her seatbelt, and took the first shot.  She would seem far more imperious than she meant to be, walking across their lawn with an almost exaggerated swagger and a mean face as she forced herself into it - but God in heaven, did she feel like a fucking whimpering quim if talking to a child gave her this much pause.

At the doorstep, she knocked loudly before James could fully catch up with her.  A quick routine to make herself more pleasant, a calm face, adjustments of her blouse, and standing back so that she could actually be seen through the peephole, and she was prepared.

She wasn’t really prepared.  Not in the least.  But she was willing to pretend she was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, he was a bit too late to be caught in sight of the peephole once the sounds of soft footsteps were heard behind the door. Then, in a well-mannered English accent, far from what was to be expected in the countryside of Italy, an older gentleman spoke as he opened the door.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mostly for the young lady of the house, who wouldn’t have to hear such violent stories until she was older, maybe eight or so.  This butler might not be too privy to his Master’s dealings (how ironic that he hates being referred to as such!).  Of course, if he had knowledge of James’ eyes and how best to contain them, he should be informed enough about his status to know what had occurred.  To see him admonish him for losing another pair of glasses, though, that’d be something she could save for later…

She put her hands on her hips and turned her nose up, and held before she could speak.  The natural tendency was to introduce herself as a certain famous fool, and to go into a long routine about how shitty of a person she was.  She would only hope that, if she ever slipped, a fellow Frankish man wouldn’t be around to hear it.

Nicolette shook her head.  “A shame that <strong>someone</strong> apparently didn’t see fit to warn you of our arrival ahead of time,” a pointed glance was aimed over her shoulder.  “But, given the circumstances, such can be forgiven, no?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The weight that was set upon those old bones of his were finally lifted. The fear he held in his heart was gone. Now, just as he wanted to, he could go back to simply serving both Aveline and James again.

“Well, you two should divulge the events of the Holy Grail War sometime then. It is not everyday you get to talk to survivors, let alone a victor, of one, you know. Perhaps over tea? I do pride myself on keeping an impressive selection, after all.

A smile, and a practiced roll of her hand followed.  “I do indeed hail from that land.  Of course, there are two sorts of people who look upon its people and remark upon them: those who call it the resplendent jewel of the Christian world, and those who would call it the gutter of the same.  I am, indeed, one of the latter, but do not let that come between us and our rapport.”

There was nothing that could lift the heart higher than shitting on France’s good name!  A new life, a second chance hadn’t changed that part of her, and even the propriety that was afforded to a new acquaintance in polite company wouldn’t stop her.

Someday, she would have to go and see if it had improved, but she feared that the fumes would bring about death before she could get across the border.

“Of course, I would still like some tea,” she said with a little deference, “I don’t pride upon my mockery so, that I would want to turn your charity down and give up a little taste of home.  I’ll give you a good story in return.”

When Walton chided her former Master (and his current), she couldn’t help but feel a little giddy about it.  A servant with a backbone!  No bowed head and fear for his life should he go too far; she assumed that it was still within the bounds of law to sentence your house staff to death for grave transgressions.  In him, though it would take a while to truly test his character, she found a bit of a kindred soul.

James’ past ability to roll with her punches had a bit of an explanation.  James’ future could become insufferable if he allowed her to join with Mr. Walton in ribbing on him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1153405682087895060 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1153405682087895060><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 18, 2023 2:02 PM">2:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“It’s just fine that he wears them,” Nicolette said, hand just in front of her mouth, “he looks positively younger with them on, I’d say.

So drawn in to the good conversation with Mr. Walton she was, that she took James’ departure as a detour to hang his shoes up, or sit in a comfortable chair, or use the closet

“Tea?  I’m no experienced drinker,” she said in a little sing-song voice as she gravitated toward the butler, “but put whatever you find sweet in it.  Honey, sugar, whatever you think fits.  James never…”

She turned.  She could just see him turn the corner down the hall, and leave them…and she knew where he was going.  Down that hallway lay the moment she had dreaded.

Nicolette could put it off further.  James wouldn’t find fault in taking a moment to rest, and drink tea, and keep her mind off of that.  Besides, he wouldn’t care.  He got to see her alive, and thriving in a way that she never had been.  Her own fear didn’t need to sour that.

She really didn’t need to do it now.

She still followed after him.

“I trust your judgement,” she said to Walton before she hurried off down the hallway without explanation.

By the time she had reached the room, she had been beaten to it - James was inside, and she could already hear them.  Nicolette took a deep breath, and dismissing the natural urge to try and adopt a persona…simply tried to empty out her mind.

She leaned around the doorframe, head poking out and eyes wide as she took in the sight that, this time, she definitely had seen before.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was a stern and solemn man outside of when she could get him to crack a smile, but that was nothing compared to the happiness he showed - the pure warmth that he radiated as he held his daughter.

It made Nicolette remember.  Reaching up to embrace a daughter that had outgrown her, and hugging her tighter just to make up for it in emphasis.  How clingy that girl was, even as an adult!  How she had almost dragged her down, trying to keep her in place with her slight weight, as if it would keep her at home instead of attending her duties.

Nicolette remembered all of that which had occurred, and unlike so often before, it didn’t come with one bit of melancholy over what had eventually happened.

What she would give to be held like that by Blanche, one more time…

Her reminiscence was halted, as her eyes caught onto Avaline’s.  With an introduction, she didn’t have the choice to hide - not without looking quite strange, she supposed - so she made a few ponderous steps into the bedroom.  Nicolette held her breath for a moment…

“Hello,” she said with no airs.  “Ms. Nicolette Ferrial, yes…James has told me quite a lot about you.”  Some of it in more painful ways than others.  It was inappropriate for the conversation at hand, but her mind somehow defaulted to extending her slightly quaking hand for a shake instead of anything more cordial.

No confidence and lacking in guile, she stood just in front of the girl.  Far more frightened than she really should be.  Much of what dwelled in her mind was what she had dwelled on for some time now, the fear of the future unknown…

…but also, some of it was simply the fear that she’d be rejected.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or, that is, she did not fear it enough to seriously worry for once.  Her trepidation towards exactly what was about to happen was great, but she trusted James enough to not try something like that - he must’ve been just consoling his daughter about someone who had rarely, if ever, met a stranger.

Imagine, being alone for so long and finally having the experience that Blanche never had - a visitor who only had the best of intentions for her.

Imagine Nicolette’s shock when she was betrayed so callously.  James had the chance to throw her aside with disregard at the end of the War and he passed it up, only so that she could be thrown to the wolves in peace!

Aghast, she was held tightly with the kind of all-or-nothing hug that overeager children are fond of, and she alternated between looking at the top of Avaline’s head with almighty worry and James with nothing but pure venom.  If he thought that bleeding to death in an alley, alone, was a poor way to go…

…but, no, she didn’t dwell on those thoughts for long.  She couldn’t.  Nicolette turned down to Avaline’s bright eyes and innocent smile, and the precocious words she spoke did something to her.

It was a kind of treachery that few things could do .  There would be no return from it, and though she may not ever realize it, Avaline had changed the course of their lives with the damage she caused.

Nicolette’s mask, aloof and indignant, was broken utterly and irrevocably for Avaline and her alone.

She carefully reached down and touched the girl’s backside tenderly, as if cradling a fragile piece of glass.  Try as she might, her mouth opened but produced no words yet.

Cruelty!  The violence you wreak upon the woman before you, Avaline, is unforgivable.  She had been shot, crushed, stabbed, bitten, beaten, frozen, gassed, exploded, stomped and amputated in the weeks prior, but none of her enemies had the temerity to make her cry.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1153407261927030784 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1153407261927030784><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, September 18, 2023 2:08 PM">2:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was a shame to cry in front of a girl who knew no better, but Nicolette did.  She patted her gently, and between sniffles, she said “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

This wasn’t something she’d ever be able to handle.  It reminded her of the past, and how a certain girl had always insisted that, no matter how she was deprived, no matter how much Triboulet had warned her that she was not a good soul…she always insisted that she was.  Unquestioning and loving.

Avaline didn’t know any better, of course, and she was just the same: unquestioning and loving.  Would she believe her if she told her the truth?

Nicolette knelt down to just a little below eyelevel, and she hugged her back, very tightly.

“I-I c-c-can try,” she told her, stifled by her sobs.  “I can try to be one.”

Maybe she could try to play that role for her, even if she wasn’t truly one.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The hug back that she received helped to calm her worries down. Those final words were the final nail in the coffin for her as well.

“R-really? You really mean that?” Her voice was getting choked up but she did her best to maintain her own composure. The tears that pooled in her eyes brought quite a contrast to the bright smile she still had on her face.

“Th-this is the best birthday ever.” Unapologetically, Aveline wipes her tears on Nicolette’s blouse in an attempt to stop them from flowing so freely. “I’m not sick anymore. I got my daddy back. And now I’ve got a new mommy…” After those words, she was unable to keep back the waterworks. 

All the emotions she kept bottled up escaped the moment the dam broke. She knew how much her father was hurting so she kept a strong face for him. Now that she didn’t need to anymore she had no reason to keep them in. Not while she was this happy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

However, he figured that this mood wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. It was okay to cry, after all. There wasn’t anything wrong with that.

James knelt once more, his leg cursing him yet again, so he could place his hands on Aveline’s shoulders to provide that comforting presence for her. The soft smile was broken to mouth the words ‘Thank you.’ to Nicolette. 

He knew that he was going to get reprimanded for his actions. That much was a given. Would it truly be any different than their time in Berenice, though? It seemed that he was a man forever cursed to be scolded for his stubborn and selfish actions. James was okay with that, however.

He saw nothing wrong with it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nicolette had much to say to her in the future, but it could wait for a bit.  Being able to cry and not fear looking vulnerable was such a rare thing…

What felt like much later, when she had finally gotten most of it out and Avaline had started to calm down a little herself, Nicolette was able to push her emotional weight down and set it to the side.  Even if this release felt indescribable, she had her limits.  As she said to this girl, “Ah, please…let’s not cry too much.  Today is supposed to be a happy day, no?”

She held up a finger and shifted to stand above her - Avaline would grow to stand well above this woman that she called mother, but now, she was so <em>slight</em> after all of the sickness… - and she gave her a practiced eager look.

“I’ve helped your father with something quite exhausting, and crying is so tiring - I’d rather spend what energy I’ve got left doing something exciting.  Do you not as well?”

One hand was held out to the doorway, and the other softly swiped about Avaline’s cheeks to clear away her tears.  “This is my first time in Italy, Avaline.  I’m but an ignorant tourist!  You surely know these parts better than I do - why don’t you help me and give me a tour of the estate?”  Nicolette pushed her by the shoulder, trying to lead her out of the room that was so familiar to her and toward places just a little less so.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I want to have fun!” Aveline did her best to fight through the sniffles and whatever tears still remained while she nodded along. At least this time she chose to use her wrists to help wipe away the tears. 

“I can show you around!” The excitement from her nods was barely snuffed out by the tears from earlier. She grabbed hold of Nicolette so she could give her a tour around her home. Since she didn’t know everything about the place, she made sure to grab hold of James’ hand as well to tug him along too. “Daddy can help too. He explored the place more.”

Thus began the small adventure of Aveline with both of them in tow around the place she called home. There were a few issues, like when she had issues trying to figure out who’s hand to let go of when she wanted to point at something, or when she couldn’t come up with a name for a room, but she did her best. 

Even though it was something minor to most people, this achieved a dream of hers that she had for a while now; spending time with both her father and a mother. Something so simple was what her illness robbed her of. However, now that it was gone, she didn’t have any such restrictions anymore! 

No longer did she need to tire herself in dreams to sleep. She had the entire world to spend all of that energy! She didn’t need to call for Walton or her father anymore when she can just run and find them herself now!

Emptying out the bucket list of things she always wanted to do, but couldn’t, started today.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ever since coming across her image in a dream, Nicolette had thought of this day happening - if she hadn’t, would she have brought it up on the boat over in the first place?

Her imagination conjured fantasies of her being the perfect mother, always making her child laugh, being stern only when needed but never running out of kindness.  Never awkward for a moment, always knowing what to say, and always being right.

The first day was absolutely not anything like that!  Sure, she was stepping up to try and keep her entertained all day…up until she virtually collapsed from exhaustion a few hours into it, and then began the very difficult task of getting a hyped-up seven year old to calm down and enjoy the unattainable thing known as “quiet time”.

For those few very active hours, she was awkward, and ill-fitting for the role she took as Avaline’s personal jester.  Her humor took a lot to adjust down to a child’s level, and though she didn’t slip and make some kind of perverse or morbid comment around her, it would need much more work.

Did Nicolette enjoy it, though?

Like nothing else in the world.

It was at some point toward the end, cleaning her face after their evening meal together (Nicolette insisted on helping Walton with making it and proved capable, once introduced to modern cooking equipment) that she had slipped and called her by the name of her own daughter.

She paused, and laughed, and brushed it off.

“It’s the name of someone that reminds me of you”, she explained.  

She didn’t feel any sadness to have been reminded of it, far from it.  It was just a moment wherein she felt…in the right place.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
