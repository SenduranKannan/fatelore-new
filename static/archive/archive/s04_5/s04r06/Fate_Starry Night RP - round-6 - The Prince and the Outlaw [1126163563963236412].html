<em>The cause?</em> A number of scratches and abrasions, mainly concentrated on his forearms and knees, that he had just poured a liberal amount of disinfectant on.
<em>The reason?</em> Ann’s spontaneous decision to teach him how to ride a motorcycle after he had expressed some moderate interest in them when passing one on the street, dragging him into the nearest shop to acquire one of their own.
<em>The casualties?</em> A Master short on breath and unironically sore muscles due to the inability to keep herself from laughing for an entire afternoon.
<em>The real casualties?</em> A Servant covered head to toe in bruises that stained his perfect skin and gave the impression that he had only just finished dueling someone who, for whatever reason, had chosen a red crayon as their weapon of choice.
Oh, and a crashed bike beyond repair, unceremoniously ditched at the scene of the crime.

Seeing as Ann, on top of finding this whole affair hilarious, was unable to provide Prince with enough magical energy to heal from these paltry injuries, he was instead forced to treat them as any human would, hence his current stubborn silent suffering as he waited for Ann to recover from her shortness of breath with a drink or two at her favorite bar. He insisted on remaining outside.

Having already been publicly beaten to a pulp in front of everyone just a few days prior, he felt embarrassed to show himself in a similarly roughed-up condition once again and disappoint the odd one or two patrons that had cheered for him as the underdog in his one-sided brawl against his Master.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126163701674815498 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126163701674815498><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 9:52 AM">9:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>“...what am I even doing?”</em>

Prince bumped the back of his head against the wall behind him to chide himself for his pointless concerns. He was a Prince once. And now he was worried about not living up to the expectations of the local drunkards?

“Well…” his face grimaced awkwardly as recalled the rush of excitement he felt as he threw himself against Ann for no other reason but to vent his bottled up emotions, a stupid and childish tantrum that she enthusiastically returned, “... it was kinda fun, I guess.”

But still! She can’t keep getting away with this!

Pressing his eyes shut and preparing for the final application of disinfectant, Prince resolved himself not to forgive Ann this time. He had already overlooked the time she tossed him into the Nile to cure his heatstroke… and the time she tried to ‘help him’ tend to his garden only to rip and drown half of his roses… and the time she shook money out of him after stringing him up like a pi&#241;ata… and the time she-

“Wait, I’m not enjoying this, am I?”

Prince pinched the bridge of his nose in horror, refusing to accept how much he had been influenced by his eternal source of suffering and fulfillment that just kept dragging him along in her neverending string of thrilling adventures.

Perhaps he should join Ann for a drink after all. A strong one this time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Prince&#39;s absentmindedness could be seen as both a vice and virtue. Disassociating from the world around you gave peace of mind and quiet introspection, letting you see facets of yourself that you couldn&#39;t otherwise-

-But sometimes, being too dreamy and distant made you easy prey to your surroundings. Though, to be fair, the Servant probably wouldn&#39;t have expected to see a black wall appear right in front of-

-Them.

&quot;Watch where yer going.&quot; A tall, elongated man that was both tough and lanky stood in Prince&#39;s path. He was covered from head to toe in dark, steeped in leather and black shapes. Green eyes were all that he could gleam through the man&#39;s face, covered in a mask that hid most of their features. The man smelled of booze, making the wyrm wonder if they had just come out of the bar. To call this person ordinary would feel downright insulting. No, to Prince, this felt more like a fated encounter. His luck had either reached its peak, or hit utter rock bottom.

&quot;...Are ya dull?&quot; Bill asked, arms crossed as he remained still. &quot;Did ya hear a word of what I said?&quot;

Apparently not. It seemed as if the bump had shocked Prince so much that he misheard the man&#39;s last few sentences. Archer was cordial enough to repeat them.

&quot;Piss off. Bar&#39;s closed. Go home to momma.&quot; Bill grunted, even though the bar was still lit, and apparently, quite lively. Ann had just gone inside after all. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

One moment he was basking in the final rays of the soon-to-set sun, and the next his view was blackened by shade, the silhouette of a conspicuously dressed man towering over his huddled form.

Prince was clothed in a relaxed white shirt and black shorts, ordinary clothes procured in this era that firmly cemented him in the second life granted to him. Perfectly ordinary even, if not a little out of place as they seemed better suited as loungewear than an outfit to wear when engaged in outdoor activities, but considering the state of the surrounding era and its less fortunate inhabitants, he more or less fit straight in.

The same could not be said for the new arrival.

Dressed as if ripped straight from a Western, making sure to add plenty of personal flourishes to the ensemble to make it absolutely clear to everyone that he was a fan of skulls and spikes, those weren’t even his most striking features. Already he stood out like a sore thumb, especially in this heat, and one could only wonder if he was just another obnoxious tourist mistaking Egypt as their personal playground.
If it weren’t for the black full-bodysuit that stood in contrast to his entire image, despite somehow tying it all together at the same time.

“...a Servant!?” a haunted whisper escaped his lips, and Prince could only hope that this misplaced outlaw drowned it out with his own brash voice.

Though Prince’s body instinctively moved to obey the loud commands directed at him, jumping to his feet and taking a step behind to put more space between them, even if only a single pace, his body yet continued to face him. It would appear he wouldn’t turn tail and run back to his momma after all.

“You…” his voice was shaky, the effort required for him to stand up and speak to the man he was terrified of as clear as his ashen locks, “You don’t look like you’re from around here.”

His hand clenched around the bottle of disinfectant tightened its grip, looking for anything to hold on to. Fortunately he was too weak to shatter it even if he wanted to.

“The bar here is pretty flexible with its opening hours as of late.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan told him that the visit to the bar would be quick, a short stop before greener pastures, but it was obvious at this point that the Dowling had the worst luck in the world. Bill couldn&#39;t tell at first glance, but it became evident on a second look that the boy in front of him was-

&quot;Yer kidding me.&quot; Bill bit his lip in frustration as Prince confirmed his suspicions, talking about how Bill was a Servant and what not. The response would have probably shocked the wyrm, since they were hoping their opponent would lower their guard. Instead, the cat was out of the bag within the first few minutes.

Bill immediately reached for his waist, causing Prince to finally take notice of the gunslinger&#39;s pistol. It was common for guns to be whipped out in less than a second in old Westerns. Would he meet a similar fate? Death by a quickdraw faster than the speed of sound?

A trembling melody echoed in his heart, until-

-Bill&#39;s hand just flew past his gun. Right into his pockets.

&quot;Don&#39;t look like I&#39;m from around here? Wonder what gave ya that idea. Pffft.&quot; Archer laughed. &quot;That&#39;s the excuse ya came up with? A clown could do a better job.&quot; Bill huffed. He wasn&#39;t lying, at least. &quot;Well, Servant or not, yer just small fry. Get out before I get big.&quot; He shook his shoulders, threatening a bit of muscle. &quot;My boss got an appointment with someone in there. Unless yer the one he plans on meeting, stay outta it.&quot;

A meeting? In the bar? But the only other one there was-

&quot;Wait. Hold on.&quot; Bill raised an eyebrow. &quot;Ah. I guess it makes sense. Tell me, is yer Master in there, perchance?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He understood the danger he was in, but the lack of open hostility had kept his mind from jumping straight into survival mode just yet. For now it appeared his opponent was content with playing with him, but Servants were nothing if not unpredictable.
Night had yet to fall. Not-too-distant voices were carried to them by the wind. The conditions for a fight were not ideal, but considering his current state, it wasn’t impossible for him to be taken out quickly before their battle could attract much attention.

<em>“Should I draw out the conversation then? Perhaps try to bluff?”</em>

Then there was the issue of their Masters. Prince did not doubt that Ann would be able to handle herself against most about any ruffian, but a mage was a different story.

<em>“No loud noises yet…”</em>

To his relief the bar’s interior appeared peaceful enough from behind the closed door, but for how long was anybody’s guess. Regardless, he could not allow this Servant to join his Master.

“You’re not wrong about me being a runt,” he diffidently replied, hoping that the outlaw would fail to notice the chilling sweat sticking to his skin, “but aren’t all Casters? Still, we tend to have a gimmick or two to make up for it, so are you really sure you want to meet us on our territory?”

Under normal circumstances he would be right. Fighting a Caster in their own workshop is like asking to be the first to sample the vast breadth and depth of their atelier, to fight them at their most powerful.

Prince had recomposed himself from the initial shock, but still looked rather tense. Good. Keep that fear in him. It made it a lot easier to see people&#39;s true nature.

&quot;Caster?&quot; Bill leaned forward, accentuating every syllable in that word. &quot;I didn&#39;t know we had any. Good to know.&quot; He smiled, phrasing it in a way that was no doubt designed to mock Prince for his loose lips. The wyrm responded with his own bravado, but what little resistance was there to be had was nothing more than a toothpick underneath Bill&#39;s soles.

&quot;You said <em>us.</em> Who&#39;s <em>us?&quot;</em> Bill pointed out. &quot;All I see is one, lonely Servant. What da hell are ya even talking about, man?&quot; He laughed at Prince&#39;s mention of Casters as a collective, as if that was supposed to frighten him.

&quot;Say,&quot; He suddenly decided to change the subject. &quot;what time does the bar close?&quot; An odd question, for sure.

&quot;If ya really wanna die,&quot; He flashed his waist once more, slightly opening his coat to make sure Prince could take a close look at the guns. &quot;I could come back later, when it&#39;s quiet.

He was clearly perceptive enough to make the connection between his presence as a Servant and the Master in the bar who appeared to be their target, yet he still insisted on Prince confirming the fact himself? Was this for intimidation? Or was he unexpectedly thorough, unwilling to leave loose ends to fade and fray?

“Rude, you say?”

Whatever the case may be, it appeared he wasn’t too keen on battling during day as well, so perhaps he could push his luck. Though his heart kept beating against his skull and made it nigh impossible for him to keep his calm, there was a tinge of ecstasy beneath it all, no doubt the result of Ann’s constant harassment now bearing fruit.

“You’re the one who has yet to introduce himself. Archer is it? Or are you Rider?”

His liberal showcase of his guns were strong clues, but Prince would know how easy it was for a Servant to tell a convenient half-truth in regards to one’s true identity. If he was a cowboy or gunslinger, his horse surely would not be far.

“And I’m sorry, but the bar has recently found itself a guest of honor. Who knows, they might even stay open until tomorrow so long as she keeps her tab open, so how about coming back when the keg’s run dry. Perhaps you and your Master can find someone else to pick on in the meantime and leave Ann alone.”

Little did he know that there weren’t many participants remaining, betraying his ignorance to recent events and proving that he was in fact exactly as the outlaw described: small fry.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The truth? A lie? It was hard to tell with Bill&#39;s mask, covering everything but his eyes. All that Prince could discern from his glare was a mocking, judgmental stare. The same look you&#39;d give to a stupid animal, like a dog chasing its own tail.

&quot;And if yer guest of honor is exactly who I think it is, well,&quot; He leaned on the wall, grabbed a chair and placed it underneath his bum. He sat on it, arching his back and grabbing another chair. He placed it at the very end of the corridor, then placed his legs on top, one foot on top of the other. This all happened in front of the bar&#39;s entrance, turning Bill&#39;s leisurely resting spot into a makeshift barricade. You could walk over him, if you wanted. If he let you, that is.

He was a stubborn one, but perhaps he should have expected that.
It was an odd situation to be in. Though the Servant’s demeanor lacked hostility at the moment, it was still far from friendly, or rather, balanced on the boundary between the two. Prince could easily imagine him taking a relaxed nap and wait for the next day if he wanted to, but expected him to just as easily decimate the bar with smoke and lead if given a reason to.

In other words, he was the one currently in charge of the situation.

<em>“Which means if I provoke him, I’m dead…”</em>

His heart-rate calming due to the temporary peace granted by the shaky impasse, yet no less tense, Prince followed his opponent’s lead and crouched on the ground, deciding against using a chair. His right palm opened and grasped at thin air, a dim glow coalescing into tangible shape.

“If that is your <em>wish</em>, then knock yourself out.”

Grasping the full bottle that manifested in his hands, he tossed it at the enemy Servant for him to catch, an American Straight Bourbon Whiskey he had seen Ann emptying on a previous occasion. Not that he had become an export in all things liquor these past few days, but fortunately simply reaching out and wishing for an ‘American drink a Cowboy would like’ was enough for the White Rose acting as his core to pull a bottle from his memories and answer his prayer.

A prayer taking the form of magecraft. Magecraft which required energy to invoke.
Though Ann was a novice mage, they were yet bound by a spiritual pact, and so he hoped that she would take note of the sensation accompanying his little parlor trick that should have become familiar to her by now. To tell her that she was not alone. That he was there should she need him.

Unfortunately she was not the only mage present.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

American brand too. How cute.

&quot;I&#39;m starting to like Casters more. Just a lil&#39; bit.&quot; Bill pinched his fingers and laughed, cracking open the bottle and partially raising his mask to reveal his charcoal lips. He drank half of the bottle in a single swig, perhaps even shocking Prince with his voracious appetite.

He didn&#39;t seem to suspect any ulterior motives. Nothing was going on in that head of his regarding a possible attack. Maybe he wasn&#39;t even worried about Prince contacting their Master. After all, with how him and Lachlan were telepathically linked, the dragon and their Master were most likely the same. No use worrying about something you couldn&#39;t change.

&quot;Haaa...&quot; Bill burped, finishing off the rest of the bottle. It had lasted him the entirety of two minutes. So much for offering Prince some respite.

&quot;So, what do I owe ya?&quot; Bill asked, arm and bottle dangling up and down like a vine. &quot;For the booze.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Prince blankly stared at the Servant wide-eyes and agape, his eyes on the empty bottle he had only just given him.

“Did you just… ah. No, I mean, it’s not like it cost me anything to make that so…”

Of course he had seen Ann perform record-breaking feats of alcoholism herself, but watching someone drain an entire bottle with the effortless ease of picking one’s nose was, to be perfectly honest, quite impressive. So much so that it left him at a momentary loss for words as he realized how easy it would have been to simply hand him a poison instead. Which begged the question.

“Wait, how did you know it wasn’t poisoned? We are still enemies at the end of the day.”

Still in awe of outlaw’s <s>to him</s> impressive feat, Prince brought forth a second bottle, opening it as he spoke and tasting a mere few drops of the liquor out of curiosity, only to immediately shudder and recoil at the taste.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was unaware of any inner turmoil the wyrm had with a fellow alcoholic, he just found their reaction to his actions rather...interesting.

&quot;Would you have done it?&quot; Bill asked, sounding bored. &quot;Would ya <em>really?</em> Because I don&#39;t think <strong>ya&#39;d have the guts.&quot;</strong>

There was no malice nor hatred in that statement. Just pure bluntness without a modicum of respect. Prince felt like he was being treated as set dressing, just a nice pair of blinds in beige to accentuate the room. He wasn&#39;t the focus, nor was he the reason for Bill to be there.

&quot;If ya wanted to kill me, why not do it before? Yer tryna waste my time or something?&quot; The cowboy shrugged his shoulders, pointing out the ridiculousness of Prince&#39;s question. <strong>&quot;Are ya even a threat if yer aren&#39;t fighting me?&quot;</strong>

He might have continued with the tirade, had Prince not generated his own bottle of whiskey and tried to drink it up. Instead, he visibly recoiled at the smell and taste of it. Bill gave a disapproving shake of the head.

&quot;That&#39;s just sad. Good liquor is wasted on you.&quot; The cowboy sighed, before extending his arm. &quot;Give it to me. Ya don&#39;t need it.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a drink a lot closer to home, perfectly chilled to combat the heat, but most importantly, it was to spare the cowboy the unpleasantness of nursing his bottle alone. This drinking etiquette he had been made to learn by Ann who had gotten sick of having nobody around to raise her glasses with.

Archer had simply downed his first serving too quickly for Prince to react.

And yet this simple act betrayed his lack of experience, both in life and in combat. The lack of hostility directed at him had already caused him to lower his guard, and while he understood that this ceasefire was only a temporary affair, it would appear that he genuinely believed his opponent not to attack him unless provoked or ordered to by his Master, so much so that his eyes even left him, instead made to nervously observe the ripples of his honeyed drink after having taken a sip.

“You’re probably right. Ann definitely would have had the guts to slip something in though…”

His words lingered on her name as Archer reminded him of their situation. He wasn’t a threat <em>yet</em>. They weren’t fighting <em>yet</em>. Neither of them would die… yet.

“When we fight, can you focus on me? What our Masters do is up to them, it’s not like I could convince her to stay out of it anyway, but I at least want to…”

<em>“...give her a chance.”</em>

He could tell that this Servant was strong, stronger than himself, and having him target Ann would be akin to a death sentence. Not that he was sure if he would even agree to his naive proposition, but so long as he could at least keep his attention on him while they fought, there was at least a chance for Ann to find a way. To do something. To survive.
Although to do that, she had her own battle to fight.

“Say,” he followed up as a worrying thought came to him, “Do you think your Master is strong?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Assassin had a presence that made her hard to ignore, especially with that in-your-face attitude and uncanny resemblance to his sister. Prince, by comparison, was dull. He had always imagined Casters as silent bookworms or shy men in robes, but what he got wasn&#39;t even that. It felt more like talking to a baby. A baby that had quite a lot to say for themselves.

Prince spoke and Bill remained silent. He spent more time drinking the second bottle than referring to the Caster, until he heard something very interesting.

&quot;You want to fight me?&quot; Archer asked, raising his tone as he swivelled his drink around, the murky liquid spinning inside the tight glass bottle. Prince followed it up with more demands and questions, asking Bill to focus all of his attention on the Caster and ignore the enemy Master. He topped it off with a half hearted question on whether Lachlan was strong or not.

&quot;Humph.&quot; Bill took a swig, holding the talk up for an entire minute as he finished his drink. &quot;My Master is strong. I wouldn&#39;t have stuck around otherwise. If we were doing a contest of <em>only</em> Masters,&quot;

&quot;then I&#39;d bet on him more than any other horse.&quot;

This wasn&#39;t a lie. Lachlan had showed himself to be resourceful and tenacious. He had already held his own against enemy Masters, and even driven them into a corner without the aid of a Servant. Did this Caster know about that? Was that why they looked worried?

&quot;He&#39;s a bad boss, but a hardworking one. Doesn&#39;t sit on his ass unlike many others I&#39;ve had. That&#39;s good enough for me to call him strong.&quot; Archer smirked.

No. If they did know about those past scuffles, then they should be even <em>more</em> terrified. Those past encounters either had Bill missing or preoccupied, after all. Now that they were together? It would be hard for <em>anyone</em> to beat them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128762581000138752 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128762581000138752><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 12, 2023 1:59 PM">1:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Perhaps that&#39;s why Caster wanted to split them up. Instead of forcing him away via combat, he was trying to bargain with the cowboy.

Bill was howling.

<strong>&quot;I will shoot yer Master dead.&quot;</strong> He laughed. &quot;If I can, then I will. That&#39;s all. If ya really want to save her, then you&#39;ll need a better offer than this.&quot; He shook the empty bottle around, then placed it on the ground.

&quot;Suppose ya chopped yer head off in this instant? I don&#39;t care about a Master without a Servant. They&#39;d just be a walking corpse at that rate.&quot; He tipped his hat while leaning back on the wall. &quot;If your Master&#39;s survival is what yer after, then that&#39;s an offer ya cannot refuse.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If anything, it was the smart answer to give, even if that did little to ease the creases on his forehead as he started to accept the hopelessness of the situation.

“But sorry, I can’t do that. I only just started finding this life fun, and in the first place,” Prince started to grumble, but this time for an altogether different reason, “I don’t think I can take verbal promises seriously anymore. Being tied up once is all well and good,” recalling the <s>fond</s> traumatic scars left in Ann’s wake, Prince seemed to forget that his experiences with her thus far were anything but normal, “but after some time the rope starts to hurt if you’re left to hang from the ceiling for too long. She promised not to do it again after I complained about it, but sure enough, when it came to buying that bike, and I refused, but it still cost a lot… you understand, right?”

Silence.

Perhaps pouring his heart out after having come to accept the inevitable clash looming ahead of him and Ann had made him more talkative than expected. Though it wasn’t exactly unsurprising. This was the first time he was able to spend time with a Servant not out to slaughter him at first sight, at least for the moment, and considering Archer considered him to be no more threatening than a roach, he felt safe enough to enjoy these last few moments left to him.

Enough to reveal the rather unusual relationship he shared with his Master.

“...you know what? Nevermind. Forget what I just said.”

Why was he so bad at this?
It was almost as if he was unable to take this situation seriously, or perhaps more accurately, did not want to. To do so would be to face the fact that the life he had only just started to relish was nearing its end. For all the confidence beaten into him by Ann, it would appear there was still too much he lacked.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That&#39;s just the way it is.&quot; Bill said with a shrug. He had never expected such a meek Servant to last so long, let alone a Caster at that. He had always imagined them as more sinister types lurking away in workshops hidden in shadow. Or maybe that&#39;s just what magi like Lachlan loved to do?

He didn&#39;t reflect on that too much, mostly because Prince started ranting about his own experiences so far. It was deep, rich, and moving. The dragon had experienced plenty of memories throughout his stay, courtesy of Ann and her whims. Prince talked about it at long, Archer remaining silent throughout.

He was bored out of his mind. Was it the weather? The current situation? The way Prince yapped on like they had experienced something truly special and worth protecting?

&quot;Ya don&#39;t know what yer talking &#39;bout, do ya?&quot; Bill asked with a low growl, desensitized by the noise at this point. Prince apologized with a <em>&#39;nevermind&#39;</em>, but it wasn&#39;t enough for the Archer.

&quot;Ya found life fun? Good. Same for me. Same for that bastard child of me Master.&quot; Snarls started coming out, his voice sounding gravely. &quot;Ya think yer the only one who had a life? The only one who killed or loved? Nope. We all came from different walks of life for one thing and one thing only:&quot;

<strong>&quot;The Grail.&quot;</strong>

&quot;And I know where it&#39;s gonna be: <strong>Right at my feet, after I&#39;ve killed all of you.&quot;</strong>

He paused, letting his words sink into Prince&#39;s mind. There would be no bargaining at this stage. Bill had enough gang members to know when to avoid redundancy. Besides, he had no leverage against Prince or their Master. Might as well erase them instead.

&quot;And ya know what&#39;s gonna happen now, dontcha, Caster? Ya should.&quot; Bill nodded. &quot;And I don&#39;t think yer getting out of this situation, really. So, lemme ask you this then: If that life of youse brought you here, <em>then what was the point?&quot;</em>

“I did not take you to be a philosopher. They really do come in all shapes and sizes.”

It seemed his opponent’s threat in regards to the inevitability of Prince’s death at his hands was instead taken as something else entirely. Not that he was utterly oblivious to the outlaw’s <s>not so</s> veiled hostility, but considering it to simply be a natural part of his demeanor, Prince’s own delusions seemed to have taken precedence.

“And well, like you said, I’m probably not going to make it out of this alive, even if I somehow managed to beat you. We were told that there might be something wrong with the Grail, but even if there wasn’t…”

Growing quiet, Prince took another sip of his mead. Perhaps he wasn’t ready yet to answer the question posed to him. Even if that hadn’t been Archer’s intent at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though, on Prince&#39;s end, he seemed to have a rather slim opinion on his chances of survival.

But Bill didn&#39;t care about that. He cared more about that last bit, which piqued his curiosity.

“I don’t know if you knew, but a genuine Saint was summoned to this War! Saint Christopher, he said… even if I didn’t know who he was in the beginning. It’s not everyday you meet one of His followers with a wolf for a head.”

Shrugging his shoulders, it seemed like he himself still had to come to grips with the revelation, limited as his education on what entailed a Saint had been.

“We fought because of a misunderstanding, everything happened so fast, and so we didn’t have a chance to talk much. He seemed sad and lost, and to fix it he wanted to do something at the church. He said there was an emissary of the Grail, but he talked about it like an enemy. An aberration.

&quot;Wolf for a head...&quot; He repeated to himself, tipping his hat and staring at the ceiling. He couldn&#39;t believe his ears. Was this fate? Or just a cruel joke? Was this his chance at revenge, or just an additional opportunity for Lancer to be a pain in his ass? Was it even worth telling Lachlan about it, considering his Master&#39;s history with the man from the graveyard?

&quot;That guy with a wolf on his head,&quot; Bill spoke up, clearly not even taking notice of the fact that said man was a saint. &quot;Are they still alive? Where are they?&quot; The cowboy asked, suddenly taking his feet off his resting place and standing up, inching closer towards the dragon. Archer looked a lot scarier up close, being a tall, lanky figure that blended in with the shadows rather easily. With the correct position, all you could see of him was his gigantic hat and two, glowing eyes prying through the darkness.

&quot;How are they not dead yet...?&quot; Bill asked, as if finding it ridiculous that Lancer had survived this long. His mind was split by murderous impulses, but whatever remained of him that was still sane took notice of the Prince&#39;s last few words. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Bill paused. <strong>&quot;An emissary of the Grail?</strong> That furry bastard is <em>that</em> high up?&quot; The cowboy asked, shocked. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“I’m not so sure myself,” he answered, waving his hands before him, “I met him on the beach not too far from here, but that was a few days ago already. And when he left… it didn’t seem like he expected to make it back.”

He did his best to be helpful out of habit, though once the cowboy took note of the Saint’s survival, his eyes narrowed. They were enemies then. Perhaps they had even fought before. The bloodlust Bill had not bothered to direct at the twerp before him now curdled his speech, a glimpse at the true nature of the opponent Prince would soon have to fight.

But for now…

“Well of course, he is a genuine Saint after all!”

Taking pride in Christopher’s achievements despite having less than nothing to do with them, his eyes were practically sparkling in response to Bill’s annoyance. Arms crossed over a puffed chest, he seemed no different than a child bragging about their older brother.

“The Grail is the cup that once held the Lord’s blood after all, so it only makes sense that a proud Saint would dispatch whatever pretender seeks to lay claim to it!”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

So, this was the burden of being a Servant and bearing your Master&#39;s wishes...

He knew that Lachlan didn&#39;t want to attract attention, so there was little point in throwing a tantrum. Instead, he focused: If Lancer had already obtained the Grail, he was sure that everyone would have known by now. Therefore, it was more likely that the wolf man&#39;s hands were still empty. However, the fact that Prince had specifically mentioned an emissary of the Grail clouded his theories with doubts and suspicions.

&quot;Who cares about him?&quot; Bill bluntly interrupted the wyrm&#39;s list of impressive feats, instead greeting them with a cold palm around the neck. He constricted Prince&#39;s neck, lifting him up like a ragdoll. There was some humor in that.

&quot;I thought ya were a Servant. Ya weigh no less than a sack o&#39; potatoes.&quot; Archer laughed. &quot;I don&#39;t care about wolfie anymore. What&#39;s this shit about the Grail? It&#39;s not supposed to show up until most of us are dead, no?!&quot; He shook Prince around. &quot;How could someone have laid hands on it? Well?!

“I-... ah! Ca… n’t-...”

He was unable to even gasp for air, mouthing silent pleas, of which the words did not pass the barrier of strangled flesh. Even if he knew the answer Bill demanded of him, he would die before he could share anything of note.

The Rose within him stirred.

Perhaps not to answer Bill’s inquiries made in regards to a fellow wish-granter, but as a response to Prince’s panicked mind. It was unable to grant stray wishes of its own volition, though pushed any further, and its bearer’s mind would reach out to it for survival.
Though it was debatable whether that would do anything to even the scales.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Their cries for help, pointless.

The only thing they had left was usefulness. Specifically, how much information Bill could pry out of the Servant before snapping their neck. Like a bird singing its last song.

How unfortunate then that Prince was so weak that he couldn&#39;t even sing under these conditions. A prim and proper prince, for sure.

&quot;Speak louder!&quot; Bill attempted to answer with more violence, since that usually worked. Instead, his tighter hold caused Prince&#39;s face to become even more blue, the flow of mana being interrupted and Caster&#39;s own body reflecting that as their arms went limp and half of their body went numb.

Bill had already been hanged once. He didn&#39;t need to experience that again to understand what was going on. He let out a pained sigh as he dropped the Servant like a sack of potatoes.

<em>THUMP!</em>

&quot;There. Fucking talk now.&quot; Archer grumbled, sounding almost shocked by how pathetic Prince was. At this rate, he wondered if he had been duped. If &#39;Caster&#39; was the Master and Lachlan was dealing with the actual Servant. Who could say?

“Perhaps they did…” he croaked, his renewed attempt at a bluff not entirely convincing with his body barely able to support itself in the dirt, “...who knows, maybe I’m actually a really powerful Caster that’s just holding back?”

With a shit-eating grin inspired directly by his Master, Prince shakily raised his arm towards the direction of the Church, the direction Saint Christopher had disappeared to, and continued his taunt.

“I’ve told you everything he told me, so if you really want to know why the Grail showed up this early, go and find out for yourself. You’re an Archer, right? What, don’t tell me you can’t see what’s going on over there from here?”

His outstretched arm remained aloft, but this time Prince turned his palm upwards in a presenting gesture, allowing for a place to capture the light coalescing above it, manifesting a golden cup from nothing. Ornately decorated. A chalice of legend.
…at least in terms of its appearance.

“I’m a Caster. What makes you think that I can’t summon the Grail right now, and if someone like me can, then there’s bound to be one or two others. Like that ‘emissary’ for one, even if he is an aberration.”

“So what do you think? Do you want to keep fighting and risk dying, or do you want the Grail right now? Take it now, and leave us alone. That, or bother whoever that emissary is and steal the Grail from them.”

Sweat ran down his furrowed brow, the stressed manner of his speech hopefully helping to sell his offer if he could just chalk it up to the soreness of his throat. It wasn’t a complete lie after all, even if it was dressed up in one, so he could only hope and pray that the cowboy did not see through his obfuscated truth.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Prince was weak, frail, a dead weight even, but he couldn&#39;t show that weakness in front of Archer. What would his Master think after all?

His mistake was assuming this was Bill&#39;s first rodeo.

&quot;So painfully dull.&quot; Bill groaned halfway through Prince&#39;s speech, specifically after the Servant had summoned the so-called &#39;Grail&#39; and flaunted it at them. &quot;Yer too human to be a Servant. Did I just get fucking duped?&quot;

<em>Human?</em>

Was this rude, loudmouth of an Archer really accusing Prince of being too human of all things? Was that meant to be praise or an insult?

&quot;People worth <strong>nothing</strong> always try saying that they are worth <strong>something.&quot;</strong> Bill grumbled. &quot;If yer strong, I&#39;d be dead already. No reason for you to keep scum like me alive.&quot; He added, his lips curling into a malicious grin. &quot;Yer just a damn liar. Ya think I haven&#39;t seen a man beg for their life before? Eh, <em>friendo?&quot;</em>

Prince blinked, and in the millisecond that it took for them to reopen their eyelid, Bill&#39;s pistol was already pointed at them.

&quot;Didja know that there&#39;s only one church in Berenice? Almost as if we are stuck on a shithole of an island, am I right?&quot; He giggled, calling Prince&#39;s &#39;bluff&#39;, if it could even be considered that. He had seen better at poker games. &quot;Since ya can&#39;t even get that right, I really struggle to believe ya could get the Grail right.&quot;

<em>BANG!</em>

Caster feared for their life, expecting a projectile straight to the head. Instead, their palms felt lighter, as the Grail now had a hole in it and was flying in mid air, thrown off by the impact of a bullet.

How was he going to lie through that? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His opponent was a Servant. A Heroic Spirit. A legendary figure that had won the mythological lottery not through luck, but sheer skill and deed, proving himself superior to the many other outlaws of his time and engraving his story over theirs for the world to remember.

Meanwhile Prince was simply an accessory to Lindwyrm&#39;s folktale, of which his was not even the only one.

Lowering his head in defeat, bitterly grinding his teeth, he couldn’t help but accept the fact that Archer was his superior in every way, lamenting for the first time how close he was to human in his current state.

<em>“He’s right…”</em>

As a human he was weak and helpless. Ordinary and redundant. Everything he would have otherwise desired, but now circumstances were different. Things had changed. Or was it himself that was no longer the same?

He let Archer’s goading get to him.

<em>“Ann… what is happening in there?”</em>

His eyes glanced at the entrance to the bar, which had remained suspiciously quiet so far. Was she safe? Did she have a plan? He could only hope that she did, since he himself was slowly running out of options.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The artificial Grail dropped dead, rolling on the ground with a gaping bullet hole in its stomach. It was clearly a fake, for no wish granting device worth its salt would have crumbled so easily. At least, that&#39;s what Archer believed.

He walked forward and stood in Caster&#39;s path, purposefully blocking their view to the bar entrance. As a skilled sharpshooter, it was child&#39;s play to tell where someone was looking at from their eyes alone.

How dull. How human. Perhaps this was just his bias speaking, but he had grown so accustomed to superhuman figures such as Saber, Lancer and Assassin, that someone like Caster stuck out like a sore thumb. Were they an exception? Or the normal standard? Even Archer, a modern Servant, thought that they looked pathetic in comparison. Something didn&#39;t add up.

&quot;My Master and yours are probably having a talk, is all.&quot; Archer grumbled, as if he was talking to living excrement. He hated the strong who bullied the weak, but he despised the weak who talked like they were strong even <em>more.</em>

&quot;Which makes me think,&quot; His lips formed a vicious grin, thinly hidden by that mask of his. <strong>&quot;If I killed ya now, how would yer Master react?&quot;</strong> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>“...because I just actually might.”</em>

The way he spoke it was as if he had just bitten into a lemon, the only reason he still resisted being due to the modicum of pride he had begun to develop in his current incarnation. He hated being powerless like this. To have his every trick and bluff seen through and discarded. He was frustrated that he couldn’t do anything to shove the cowboy’s smug attitude back into his masked face… but things were not hopeless yet.

For as big as he talked, he had yet to hurt him. Even the bullet he had shot just now was only meant for his mockery of the Grail.

<em>“But then again, he did choke me too.”</em>

That outburst threw a wrench in his theory, but one could argue that he acted unnaturally because of his emotions. At least thinking that way brought Prince some degree of false comfort. Fact remained that they were opposing Servants, and with every chance to take him out in ways that won’t alert the public, just like the aforementioned choking, perhaps this meant that this stereotypical outlaw possessed some unexpected loyalty to his Master after all? Perhaps he had told him not to initiate battle until his business with Ann was done?

Sure he could try to buy more time, but to what end? It wasn’t like he was working towards a greater strategy, and as much as he wanted to believe so, he sincerely doubted that Ann was either. Negotiations with Archer had already broken down, as he didn’t seem to budge to compromise and show mercy. All things considered, his honesty was appreciated.

Which meant all he could really do is humor him and keep himself from getting killed.

“Because as little as my Master would care, I am still pretty attached to being alive. She’s a real slave-driver that one, but at least she can hold her own in a fight.”

A lie and a truth. Perhaps that will make it a bit harder to read him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill&#39;s question was more of a retort, directed specifically to Prince&#39;s own question. If Caster couldn&#39;t fight, nor defend themselves, then their only solution was to give up and beg for mercy. No different than someone bringing a knife to a gunfight.

But instead of begging for their life, Prince started ranting about outside factors. They mentioned their relationship with their Master, how little their Master cared, and how much Prince cared in comparison. Anything to prolong their life by just a few seconds-

A searing pain could be felt on Prince&#39;s left side. Fresh, warm liquid started to trickle down from it. If he touched around his cheek, he would feel something missing around the side of his head. Most of his earlobe had disappeared, as if a bullet had just gone through it. But how? Everything felt so quiet-

&quot;Life funny to you? Or maybe death is?&quot; Bill asked. The Caster couldn&#39;t tell if their opponent was irritated, angry or simply curious. &quot;Ya showed me that ya had zero power, yet think ya get a say in who lives or dies? I don&#39;t care what yer Master thinks if ya die, hell, I don&#39;t even care what <em>you</em> think about dying yerself.&quot;

His spuds hit the wooden floor, creaking around like axe slowly grinding on the pavement, awaiting the execution.

&quot;Those with power get to talk big. Someone like you, who never experienced power in the first place, could never understand.&quot; Archer spat, staring down at the Caster with disgust. He couldn&#39;t believe the person in front of him was a Servant. &quot;At least dogs bark before they die. You?

A whisper carried on the wind. Inaudible even to the two supernatural beings.

Suddenly, the white-haired caster was enveloped in a powerful surge of magical energy. An eruption of blinding light shot out of his delicate body, an explosion that swept away everything and everyone around him.

The boy&#39;s pearly white skin began to shimmer as layers of skin conjured and spiralled around him quickly and gracefully, each glistening layer fusing seamlessly with the next as they stuck to his body.

His delicate form elongated and reshaped as the cocoon of skin wove its enchantment, his fair skin and blue eyes evolving into the features of a white, reptilian creature.

In moments, the astonishing transformation was complete, leaving behind a resplendent <strong>dragon</strong> where the boy once stood, its luminous scales reflecting the pure essence of his being, the air seemingly freezing around it as dust and debris settled under it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The entire world was black, save for himself, his executioner, and the distant image of Ann in the back of his mind. He could not escape the sound of Bill&#39;s footsteps, the cowboy approaching with his gun raised. The killing intent was there, neither cold nor heated. Archer was just following the standard process, but part of him felt disgusted. Disgusted by Caster&#39;s weakness.

Those who spoke like him, he couldn&#39;t tolerate. Attachments, loyalty and love; a whole bunch of crud. The sign of a sheltered, well-off life. He couldn&#39;t help but want to ruin that, to ruin Caster&#39;s life.

And in part, he did.

&quot;...What the-&quot;

Something louder than thunder and more powerful than a flashbang hit Bill&#39;s eyes. He went blind, at least for two seconds. Two seconds felt like an eternity to a gunslinger, since you could pull a trigger in about half of that. He immediately recoiled, aiming for cover, but there was none. He anxiously opened his eyes and was greeted by something that he could have never dreamed of.

A giant, white dragon was standing in his path, debris falling down on its side due to the sheer size of the magnificent creature. Too large to contain and brimming with magical energy. Bill looked like an ant in comparison.

&quot;You...Don&#39;t got the strength to do that?&quot; Bill asked again, realizing that Caster was no longer there. Had they summoned this beast before retreating? No, they would have left some sort of trace, then. Instead, it seemed more likely that-

-The dragon was Caster.

<em><strong>&quot;FUCK.&quot;</strong></em> Was the only thought that crossed Bill&#39;s mind as he immediately turn around and ran with his tail between his legs, sliding into the bar and hiding away. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
