Taking a defiant swing from the pilfered bottle in her left hand, she suddenly wavered, a wave of dizziness crashing over her, followed shortly by a head-splitting headache.

Taking in the cold night air helped offer some sobriety, though a hint of nausea and an ever-increasing urge to puke lingered. She stepped away from the building and cast her gaze in the distance, looking for the silhouette of her bandaged and probably very <em>irked</em> Servant. She <em>did</em> make him wait almost fifteen minutes for what was supposed to be a single drink, after all… but then again, it’s not like he could go against her anyway. A mischievous smile tugged at her mouth, as she couldn’t help but enjoy that unintentional power play. Pushing that guy around was always so entertaining. Ahh… she couldn’t wait to blow off some steam by bullying him on their way back home!

As she finally spots his tiny figure in the distance, her heart plummets as she locks eyes onto a scene she hadn’t expected. That of her Servant standing besides a man she recognized to be the one from <em>that time in the plane</em>. A sinister figure brandishing a gun, pointed towards Prince’s bleeding head.

Lachlan was inside the plane during that time too, and he was a Master. Ann connected the grim dots as a surge of adrenaline coursed through her veins. How could she be so dumb. That masked figure looked straight out of a western movie. A walking anachronism such as him could only be a <em>Servant</em>. And somehow, someway, he also deduced Prince was a Servant and held him at gunpoint.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1142613857441959959 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1142613857441959959><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 19, 2023 7:19 PM">7:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“...fuck.” She mouthed with a deep scowl as resolve replaced shock, the punk readying herself to intervene and get Prince out of this situation. More adrenaline pumps, and her mind races, searching for a way out.

As far as Lachlan was concerned, she was Servant-less and had given up on the war. If her little trickery was exposed, knowing how unhinged the puppeteer was, a confrontation would be inevitable. Prince was already held at gunpoint, meaning his situation with the cowboy was also not on the friendliest of terms.

There was only one way out, which was facing the danger head-on. Ann’s eyes narrowed, a wild grin spreading across her face.

“Sorry Prince, but if we’re gonna get out of this sticky situation alive…” The command seals on her right hand began to glow a deep red, a faint fizzling accompanying their oppressive light, a ner. “...then you’re gonna have to turn back into a dragon, even if you don’t like it!”

Her arm shot up as she made her wish, and with a whisper, commanded the bleeding Prince to: <strong>”Turn back into Lindwyrm.”</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though no flash or sound accompanied the act, the warm trickle of blood flowing down his neck was proof enough, undeniable evidence that put weight behind the outlaw’s spoken truth.

Only those with power get to decide their own fate.

Prince could not deny the truth of those words, powerless as he was at the moment. With but a single bullet, Archer had put him in his place, free to break his neck or spirit, bury his body and pride. As a human he was helpless. Weak. Unfitting to give shape to the choking frustration threatening to burst from his chest, and indignity born from his desire to live and love, a rebellious spirit kindled by none other than the woman… who had just entered his sight?

<em>“Ann?”</em>

To be seen in his current state filled him with shame, but to his surprise her gaze did not contain disappointment nor pity. It would appear she had long since let go of the dissatisfaction she felt towards his human form, but that did not mean she wasn’t blind to its shortcomings.
A wicked grin. The ominous glow of crimson red.
Having decided at once the optimal outcome for their hopeless situation, she made the choice to deliver to Prince the means by which he could rage against the dissatisfaction plaguing him, to rid himself of his soft frailty and allow him to fight back against the derisive man before him.

Even so…

“At least warn me before you-!”

His final moments were spent in a childish tantrum, his words drowned out by the explosive surge of magical energy as one by one, brilliant white fabrics flew to his side fro who knows where and enveloped him in a budding cocoon, an unnatural sight of flowering flesh which only grew in size until close to bursting, at which point it blossomed to give way to a phantasmal of old, a draconic Lindwyrm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Slithering close and beholding the familiar sight of the woman’s fiery red hair, it breathed its first breath, teeth brought perhaps a bit too close to her delectable figure before suddenly pulling back and closing its maw, a faded recollection reigning in its primal instinct.

It meant to address her as its bride, yet the words were caught in its throat in favor of her name, thus ending up remaining silent. Mesmerized by the brilliance of her eyes, it simply stood still and watched her, sensing no threats around it at the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan found himself in a relatively decent mood. <em>Decent</em>, because he had unexpectedly managed to blow off some steam while engaged in trash talk with a commoner he hadn&#39;t initially thought could be remotely interesting, and was subsequently proven otherwise. But it was also <em>relative</em>, because as soon as he had left Ann&#39;s vicinity, that adrenaline rush he had experienced just moments ago began to curdle into a less palatable sensation.

A metaphorical headache, as if he were suffering from some kind of withdrawal; Lachlan raised a hand to his temple, massaging it lightly before carding slender fingers through his hair to alleviate more of that tension.

&#39;I suppose you could label that as a colossal waste of time,&#39; he placed a hand against the front door, before turning to face Roland. &#39;Just an extra word of caution: don&#39;t actually get too cozy with her and invite her on that trip, alright?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When one left, another one entered. That&#39;s how bars kept being in business. Though, in this case, Bill felt like there was zero reason for anyone to be outside right now, unless they wanted to get turned into kibble. He was ready to shove whatever rock had decided to block his path, until he realized that they were a very talkative, well-dressed and rather rude rock. More of a boulder, really.

&quot;Bossman.&quot; Bill spat out, the shock actually muting the anxiety in his voice a bit, but it was shortlived. &quot;I mean, Master! Ya won&#39;t believe what&#39;s going on outside! A goddamn <em><strong>dragon</strong></em> is out there!&quot; He shouted, shutting the door behind him and talking with rather lively arms, trying to show how big the beast was. 

Come to think of it, it was hard for Bill to process in the first place. He had never lived to see dragons, nor were dragons common folk stories back in his day. Cherokee folklore didn&#39;t quite believe in giant, fire breathing lizards, instead being limited to images of giant snakes and birds. No wonder he was so shook; he was practically dealing with an alien creature. And unlike the wolfman, this one made him look like a sweet summer ant, ready to get pissed on.

He caught Lachlan by the shoulders, never mind his own discomfort from being squished between the redhead and the doorframe. The word &#39;dragon&#39; rang a bell. <em>Several</em> bells, actually. It was a word that had been haunting them ever since their arrival in Berenice...no, even before that, back on the plane. Several hours prior to landing, the sky had turned as hot an inferno, and their aircraft had erupted into plumes of smoke.

&#39;What dragon?&#39; Roland asked again, his breath quickening with panic.

But the blonde needn&#39;t have asked. Frost was already spreading across the bar&#39;s windows, while commotion grew outside. It felt as if the air itself had frozen, and Berenice had been plucked out of the mild winter of Egypt and dropped smack dab in the middle of Wisconsin. Home, sweet home.

Except no. Not quite.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, September 7, 2023 8:54 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Pipe down,&#39; he said, feigning composure, even though his fingers were busy crumpling the cigarette pack in his grip. &#39;What exactly is so hard to believe? <em>You</em> came straight out of a fairytale too. Besides, this isn&#39;t our first rodeo.&#39;

He was referring, of course, to their rather harrowing experience back on the plane. His voice trembled, but it wasn&#39;t a result of fear...but rather anger. There was no second dragon on the island. If a dragon had appeared, then it could only mean one thing.

&#39;That fucking <em>witch</em>,&#39; he said savagely, letting the pieces fall into place. &#39;Her Servant&#39;s still alive.&#39;

Then, another thought struck him.

&#39;And you couldn&#39;t sense that Berserker from miles away?

While Roland kept blabbering in a trance, Cherokee Bill was more focused on where to go to next. He realized soon enough that there was no exit, as the windows started taking on a frosty exterior.

<em>&quot;What is this? Fog? Or-&quot;</em> He tapped it, only to feel a chill in his fingers and a slight crack on the glass. It was frozen solid, like the world had been swallowed by a frozen tundra. No doubt the work of that gigantic dragon.

It simply made Bill panic more. He couldn&#39;t imagine facing someone with the power to control the weather. He turned back to his Master, ready to drag them out by force, if necessary, only to see that the hatchling had tailed him so closely that Archer almost slammed face first into Lachlan&#39;s own forehead.

He refrained from grunting, instead casting his Master a long, disdainful stare. It wasn&#39;t hatred for his Master, more so a thought like <em>&#39;Are ya really gonna waste my time and drag me down to my death like this?!&#39;</em>

&quot;A Berserker would have attacked me at first sight, no?! That thing was no beast, just a shrimp of a boy! A mousy little Caster that I could choke with one hand.&quot; Bill spat out, spit landing on Lachlan&#39;s face.

&quot;That&#39;s normal to youse?!&quot; He asked, then turned to Roland, as if asking someone to back him up here. &quot;Clearly not! How was I supposed to know some runt that couldn&#39;t even be considered a Servant would end up hiding a dragon in their ass? And what&#39;s this about a wit-&quot;

Witch. Bitch. <em>Woman.</em> He did vaguely remember an encounter involving a dragon and a lady. One involving a plane-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1149052730388791408 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1149052730388791408><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, September 6, 2023 1:45 PM">1:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;No way.&quot; Bill grumbled, desperate and furious. You could see the tiredness in his eyes, like someone had just received a letter about an overdue bill. Something that had been left unattended and was now striking back in full force. He should have shot down that woman when he had the chance, back then.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s even <em>worse</em>, ain&#39;t it?&quot; The cowboy laughed, but his anger didn&#39;t wane. He placed his hands on Lachlan&#39;s shoulders and shook him. &quot;They know what we look like. My Class. My weapons. And even if we hightail it outta here, I doubt we&#39;d be faster than something that could keep up with a plane.&quot; Lachlan could easily sense the despair in the man&#39;s voice.

&quot;...So we&#39;re stuck here. Great.&quot; Followed by irritation. &quot;Where are yer puppets? Is Leapfrog fast enough to get us outta here, ya think? Better yet, just throw everything at them.

Even though Roland himself was far from it. Anxiety was infectious, and Bill&#39;s explosive reactions were already dangerously close to giving him a heart attack.

&#39;I&#39;m going to be completely honest with you,&#39; the blond continued, staring hard into the dark slits where Archer&#39;s eyes would have been if not for his mask. &#39;Nothing, I repeat, <em><strong>nothing</strong></em> has been remotely &quot;normal&quot; for me in the last few weeks. Don&#39;t even ask me what qualifies as normal anymore. I don&#39;t know, and frankly, I don&#39;t want to know. <em>Okay?</em>&#39;

His voice was borderline cracking as his body shivered, perhaps from the chill that had been settling into the bar, perhaps fear, or perhaps an unhealthy mix of both.

&#39;So, we&#39;re dealing with a Caster, they&#39;re supposed to be weak, right?&#39; He asked both Servant and Master, as if trying to validate that all of his studying had been paying off. &#39;The dragon could be some kind of familiar, right? In that case, you just need to locate the Caster and take him out! You can do that easily, <em>right?</em>&#39; He demanded.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That can&#39;t be right. Even the Church confirmed it. That&#39;s a Berserker we&#39;re dealing with.&#39; 

Lachlan rubbed his nose, too busy trying to make sense of the discrepancies between Bill&#39;s claims and the information they had gathered so far. So preoccupied was he, that he even forgot to chastise Bill for bumping into him again.

Every sign pointed to the Dragon being a Berserker, from their savage behavior to their downright abhorrent mana consumption. Lachlan was well aware of why Lindwyrm had been devouring humans relentlessly; even a beast wouldn&#39;t <em>consume</em> humans for mere sport, but for a deeper motive—to replenish its mana reserves. Considering that Ann was a complete novice in magecraft and most likely sported terrible magic circuits, it made the most sense.

After all, every action had a purpose, even if it seemed irrational or insane from the outset.

Bits and pieces of Lachlan&#39;s thoughts transmitted via their telepathic link. Bill could tell that his Master was hard at work, trying to figure out the &#39;whys&#39; and &#39;hows&#39; of the situation. This fixation stopped Lachlan in his tracks, causing him to stare vacantly into Bill&#39;s mask rather than take his advice to sacrifice his puppets and escape. Just how <s>slow</s> meticulous could his Master be?!

<em>Bill couldn&#39;t be lying, could he?</em>

An accusatory thought flared up. Lachlan&#39;s contemplation briefly strayed toward the idea that his own Servant might be inventing excuses for his lack of vigilance. The experience was deeply vexing and insulting; even though it hadn&#39;t been voiced out loud, Bill still felt the sting of Lachlan&#39;s doubts. However, before he could turn his Master into mincemeat for casting such unsavory doubts on him—

<em>Nah. Bill&#39;s too dense to lie about something like that.</em>

Immediately, a thought several times more condescending replaced the puppeteer&#39;s doubts. Lachlan&#39;s face lit up briefly as he came to some kind of resolution.
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1149367965179969627 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1149367965179969627><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, September 7, 2023 10:37 AM">10:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&#39;Doesn&#39;t matter,&#39; he finally spoke. &#39;Whether that Berserker can camouflage itself or not, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that we&#39;re in deep shit. We can&#39;t outrun it—remember how it tore a plane in half? Leapfrog can&#39;t outrun something like that.&#39;

He drifted towards the bar, to the beleaguered owner who had been mindlessly polishing the same glass for the past few minutes. The man was torn between the desire to stay, to chase after the customers who had used the commotion as an excuse to leave without paying, or to flee the scene himself.

Lachlan decided to give the man a hand and simplify his decision making process.

&#39;This bar belongs to me now,&#39; he declared, slapping his hand down on the counter. &#39;I&#39;m taking it off your hands.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;Depends on how much ya offering,&#39; ever the entrepreneur, the owner quickly shifted gears. 

The bar had been coughing up more dust than profit in recent years. He was also getting real fed up with babysitting the drunkards on a daily basis, not to mention there was currently a monster stomping around outside and a dozen or so meters away from turning this building into scrap. Say, did he ever buy insurance for this place...? 

Perhaps it was time to sell it while he still could. An early retirement was starting to sound like a beachside cocktail with an umbrella and slices of fruit inside...

The owner puffed out his chest.

&#39;I&#39;ve had this bar for decades,&#39; he said, turning on his salesperson charm. &#39;It&#39;s got history, this place. I wouldn&#39;t part it for...&#39;

It got to the point that even Bill got sick of hearing him, no doubt due to the mention of Caster. If only he had shot the prick instead of toying with them.

&quot;Nobody asked for yer life story.&quot; Archer replied, deadpan furious. How rich of the butler to demand Bill to stay calm, when they looked like a trembling ant themselves. No doubt the stress levels were reaching their peak, for both of them.

&quot;Ya know what, Roland?&quot; Bill sighed, turning to Lachlan&#39;s lackey. &quot;Why dontcha just step outside, go find the Caster for us, and make sure yer screaming <em>&#39;Yo, I&#39;m the enemy Master, yo!&#39;</em> while yer doin&#39; that? That&#39;d probably give us enough time to flee.&quot; He didn&#39;t mince words, putting Roland down like he was a disobedient puppy. To him, it was a one-off remark, without much thought put into it. To Roland, it probably felt like a demolition of his entire being. He&#39;d need to book a day off after this.

Maybe even two, if Bill had kept going. Thankfully, Lachlan intervened instead, not through words, but by simply daring to think.

Something less than flattering was going on in that man&#39;s head. Enough for Bill to give him a nasty side eye.

&quot;What was that?&quot; Archer asked, straightening his hat and losing interest in Roland. He felt his Master&#39;s thought, enough to get him fired up from the context. &quot;Speak up. Don&#39;t be shy now-&quot; He felt like pursuing it, until Lachlan came to an epiphany.

&quot;I guess yer right about that.&quot; Bill faltered in face of the reminder. No shit that Leapfrog couldn&#39;t keep up with a plane. But what else could they do? They were trapped, and any attempt at running seemed better than none. Clearly Lachlan disagreed, since he immediately took initiative and headed towards the bartender.

Bill fell quiet, but he was impressed. That was a very efficient armed robbery. On a score from 1 to 10, he would probably rate it a 3. But that was beyond the point-

&quot;The hell are ya doin&#39;?! Getting drunk won&#39;t fix this!&quot; Bill shouted, the irony being palpable. Roland could swear that not too long ago, Cherokee Bill was doing the same back at the arcade with that wretched clown.

&quot;Don&#39;t bother rummaging through trash, it&#39;s a goddamn <strong>dragon!</strong> Ya think something a human made can hurt it? I doubt even me guns can hurt it, unless ya got some ancient sword stuck in yer bumhole.&quot; Archer grunted, envy in his voice. Reaching for his pistol seconds later simply confirmed that. He probably wished he was more like the wolfman, with magical weapons and defences. Alas, he was but a man. A figure that was barely noteworthy compared to the dragons of old.

Surely his Master knew that?

<em>&quot;What is he even doing? Can&#39;t he tell that it&#39;s hopeless to fight head on?! We&#39;re better off trying to-&quot;</em> Bill&#39;s thought paused. Lachlan could sense a judgmental gaze upon him, and it wasn&#39;t the one his father gave him whenever he had too much to drink. It was...

...Respect?

<em>&quot;No. He&#39;s smart enough to know that. He&#39;s so fucking pathetic that he probably knows how weak he is in comparison to a dragon.&quot;</em> Bill thought, stroking his chin. Respect quickly turned into disdain, with a twinkle of projection added on top. The Dowling boy felt a slight chill, but it was easy to ignore.

In fact, the voice in his head soon vanished, replaced by a dull calmness. Something was brewing in Bill&#39;s mind. Something good. His breath was stabilizing, his thoughts coalescing. The mental reload of his cranium had been completed, each chamber being filled with thoughts on how to get out of this mess of a situation.

<strong>&quot;Ya know that we still have a war to win, right?&quot;</strong>

Bill leaned over the counter, watching Lachlan dig for more bottles.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1149450660165722143 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1149450660165722143><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, September 7, 2023 4:06 PM">4:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I dunno what got ya in a suicidal mood, but leave me outta it. I&#39;m here for the Grail. Nothing more, nothing less. I thought ya wanted it too. That was the agreement.&quot; He narrowed his eyes, as if accusing Lachlan of letting him down. A pact forged through pain should not be easily broken.

&quot;And the way I see it, if we manage to run away, if we manage to live another day, we can still try again next time.&quot; Bill added, taking a seat and resting his arm on the counter.

<em>clac</em>

He placed his gun on the wood, then raised his hand, leaving the gun free for anyone to grab.

&quot;That&#39;s how we outlaws fight. We shoot, then run. Shoot, then run. Shoot. Run.&quot; He tapped impatiently on hard wood.

&quot;I&#39;m the greatest gunslinger ever, <strong>because I don&#39;t take fights I can&#39;t win.</strong> Why do ya think they chased me round the desert?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;And this fight? This fight has those same vibes. I can&#39;t stay put. I gotta get outta here.&quot;

&quot;You know this, don&#39;t you?&quot;

A test of resolve. Bill knew for a fact that Lachlan was smart. Maybe even smarter than him. But experience had taught him plenty of times that running away was the solution to all problems. Even if it resulted in losses. Even if he had to sacrifice an arm or a leg to keep going, he could still live to fight another day.

Instead, Lachlan was asking him to bet it all right now.

&quot;If yer plannin&#39; to waste my life, ya can fuck right off.&quot; He curled his hand into a fist. &quot;...But yer the type of brat who eats their veggies. All of them, in fact. Anything to make that the food ain&#39;t wasted.&quot;

<em>clac</em>

Bill grabbed his gun again and spun it around.

&quot;So tell me, Master-&quot;

<strong>&quot;-how do you plan on using this gun of yours?&quot;</strong> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan emerged from the dusty shelves, nearly bonking Bill on the chin. He was covered in dust from the shoulder up, which just goes to show how long it had been since the previous owner had last cleaned the place. He groped around a bit with eyes half closed, until he found the counter and dropped the bottles he had collected down on the wood, delicacy be damned.

&#39;Suicidal? Speak for yourself.&#39; He retorted, dusting off his head and plucking a spider&#39;s web from his hair before flicking it in Bill&#39;s direction. &#39;Running and living to fight another day? We&#39;re not in some video game where you get to try so long as the power&#39;s on. This is a Holy Grail <em>War</em>, and you know what typically accompanies wars?&#39;

He swiped several glasses off their rack. &#39;Death, Cherokee Bill. Is it really a shock if we end up being the ones who die today?&#39;

&#39;Although...&#39;

With a loud <em>CLUNK</em>, he slapped an empty glass down in front of Bill. &#39;I don&#39;t recall ever saying we&#39;re going to die. What I <em>do</em> remember, however, is some cowboy once telling me that when the going gets tough, <strong>we drag everyone down to our level.</strong>&#39;

One by one, Lachlan lined up the dusty bottles. Whiskey, vodka, tequila, rum; all the good stuff, the best the bar had to offer.

&#39;So, what&#39;ll it be, lad?&#39; He looked at Bill, as if trying to drill a hole into his expressionless mask. &#39;My grandpa always said that whiskey was the best thing to fend off the cold, but you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re from around here...&#39;

He grabbed a third glass and slid it towards an empty seat next to Bill.

&#39;Might as well make a toast before I kick you out,&#39; he called out to Roland. &#39;For your own safety.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, September 8, 2023 3:11 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1149799001311432705 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1149799001311432705><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, September 8, 2023 3:10 PM">3:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A gun thrust into the hands of a rookie soldier, fighting for a war they didn&#39;t even believe in. Those types of weapons were quick to break, usually lost in a ditch after their owner&#39;s death. He was worried that Lachlan was headed for that same path, clouded by arrogance or thickness.

Instead, Lachlan was simply trying to oil up. He never had any intention of giving up easily, and even if the battle ahead was treacherous, he intended to see it fully. A glass thumped on Bill&#39;s side of the counter, ready to be filled. Like an empty chamber.

&quot;Touch&#233;.&quot; Bill grumbled, picking up three bottles and cracking them open, pouring them all at once in some unholy mixture. He took a swig, then another. Two swigs was all it took for the drink to vanish.

&quot;Gramps didn&#39;t know shit then.&quot; Archer chuckled. &quot;But he sounds like he had good taste in drinks. I&#39;ll drink to him, then.&quot; He filled out another glass, then raised it in Lachlan&#39;s honour. Two gulps and the drink was gone.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Bill burped, getting off the counter. He would normally indulge a bit more, but after that one time at the arcade, alcohol had lost a bit of its luster. Instead, he looked back to Roland. &quot;Drink yer fill. Gonna work both of you like dogs. Can&#39;t see how we&#39;re getting past this dragon otherwise.&quot;

&quot;So, how do we kill a dragon?&quot; Bill turned to his Master, interrogating them with a taunting tone. He knew for a fact that Lachlan wanted to win, but recklessness didn&#39;t befit the Dowlings. Surely the puppeteer had something in stock?

&quot;I&#39;d love to drag it down, as ya said, but how do ya go about it? Hmmm? Mister mage?&quot; Bill asked, hand twitching and tempted to grab another shot of whiskey. &quot;Guess I&#39;m too sober. I&#39;m better off drunk in a place like this.&quot;

Layer by layer, Lindwyrm&#39;s hides regenerated, forming a shell. A white shell of terror and dread.

With great elation and a twinge of regret for Prince, Ann stood still as the wyrm slithered to her side, devouring her with its blue eyes. They were as uncanny to her now as they had been when Prince first appeared. She had grown accustomed to Prince&#39;s soft face arboring those orbits. To see them back on a scaly creature was eerie and unpleasant. It just felt... wrong, in a way she couldn&#39;t put her finger on.

Pushing those unpleasant thoughts away, Ann’s heart pounded as she stared the creature down. She was fully ready to call it back if it tried biting the hand of its Master, but it did no such thing. Did it learn, or was instinct guiding it? Ann couldn’t be sure.

“Not a single word of gratitude after I revived you, huh? What a conceited little shit you are, Lindwyrm.” Smirking, she walked over to the creature, running her hand over its muzzle, quietly reminiscing the events she lived alongside the creature, which now felt like distant memories.. “Well, whatever. Not like I brought you back to chat.”

Her eyes narrowed, her expression turning more serious, turning to stare at the bar behind them, as if gazing through it to Lachlan and Bill on the other side. 

“We’ve got two enemies waiting for us on the other side of that bar… and they’re no pushovers. We might die fighting them.” Her hand squeezed Lindwyrm’s scaly nose as she turned to lock eyes with it, resolve burning through her eyes. “How many of your skins can I wear before I go mad?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Its protective speech was cut short by the fire burning in her eyes, the resolve hot enough to melt even its most chilling ice, enough to have it shrink beneath her in anticipation of her reproach to its treatment of her as its bride, a delicate trinket to be preserved for its own enjoyment.

The lecherous beast repeated with the same tone as asking her for that day&#39;s weather, pressing its limbs against the ground, shoulders shifting left and right as it began the process of molting its first skin.

&quot;Or... you just wanted a last look, you know, just in case things go south?&quot; Surprise and embarrassment slowly melted into a sort of cool acceptance as Ann shrugged her shoulders, dropping her gig bag to the ground without a care. With a smirk, she unzipped her biker jacket and shrugged it off her shoulders, revealing a grime-speckled tank top sticking to her skin. Her toned arms bore imprints of bruises and scars, tracing untold stories of countless fights and brawls. 

She fished inside the jacket&#39;s pocket for her lighter and pack of cigarettes, then nonchalantly balled up her jacket and flung it behind her, as if casting off waste. &quot;Next.&quot; She declared, locking eyes with the dragon, unburdened by any shame in presenting herself before it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not particularly directed at its Master, it was a mystery yet lacking a clear answer, yet it was bound by it nonetheless, compelled to encourage their equal trade of shed shifts. A condition Ann accepted without much resistance. At once she had discarded her jacket behind herself, retrieving one pack of her damnable cigarettes in the process. Was it revenge perhaps? Her way of getting back at the rude beast that had asked her to strip? At least she had spared it the biting stench of their smoke for now.
Regardless, she had fulfilled her end of the bargain, and like clockwork, so did Lindwyrm proceed to shed its next skin.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She pushed off one boot with her other foot until it barely stuck, and with a nonchalant leg sweep, sent it flying to the side. Her black sock-covered foot casually rested on the grimy ground as she shot Lindwyrm a tense sideways glance.

“...so, this counts as shedding a dress, right?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Whether it was because it was disappointed at the lack of exposure or the fact that Ann was technically right was unclear.

In short, <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">&quot;...yes,&quot;</code> there was nothing wrong with Ann shedding a boot in exchange for its hide, even if the reluctance to abide was painted clear across its sulking features.

The bride it had chosen for itself this time around was certainly the most crafty yet, as just like that, she had deprived it of three of its layered skins, now presented before her as they shrunk and took on the guise of embroidered fabric, royal cloaks that matched the brilliant white of Lindwyrm&#39;s scales.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Three dresses for three draconic skins, a <s>un</s>fair trade.

Her eyes lit up with a mixture of amazement and mischief as she reached out and grabbed one of the cloaks, holding it to her side while Lindwyrm occupied the other side of her vision, the punk comparing the two. They shared the same pristine white colour, and the cloak&#39;s intricate patterns and texture resembled that of its draconic scales. Even as she watched the shed skins transform into cloaks before her eyes, she could hardly believe that these cloaks had come from Lindwyrm&#39;s skin.

She grabbed the other two cloaks and stacked all three, throwing them over her bare shoulders at the same time. The three cloaks began to merge into one great mass of mystical fabric, which then adjusted to her size, growing a little wider at the shoulders and a little longer, barely touching the ground.

&quot;I know it&#39;s a bit late to ask,&quot; She shrugged a few times to make the cloak fit better over her body, turning to look at Lindwyrm. &quot;But you&#39;ll be fine with only six skins against the gunslinger, ri-&quot;

A raw, intoxicating sensation took over her body as she lumped forward and clutched the cloak with tight fists, her knuckles turning white from the exertion.

She gritted her teeth, a fierce expression etched across her face as she tightly held her breath and stared the dragon. This was different from when she looked herself in a mirror. A wild madness that tinged with exhilaration. Was it... Lindwyrm&#39;s madness, seeping through the cloaks?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even if the extent of her exposure was limited to her sock and nape, Lindwyrm did note waste this rare opportunity regardless. Long had she denied it its ceremony of bonding, gruesome as it was, so it would relish this pointlessly small success after having finally gained an edge over its Master.
Which begged the question, just how tight was its leash if so doubtful a victory managed to satisfy it?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“No King’s army is a match for creatures bearing draconic heritage. Whether it be Servant or Mage, their bodies will sate my hunger all the same.”</code>

A large boast. One not entirely convincing considering its first encounter with Triboulet had left it wounded and scarred, while Philoctetes had promptly laid it low. One would have thought that such experiences would have left their mark in the beast’s mind, but it would appear its capacity for growth was limited by the reach of its fang and claw, its instincts still calibrated to the medieval ages when it knew no other predator that could challenge it.

Amidst its gloating display, it noticed Ann’s exposure to its skins however.
Immediately it lowered itself to her level and inched closer.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Even the slightest exposure is felt so keenly. Come to your senses bri-... control it Ann.

If her eyes were like alcohol, these cloaks were like a hallucinogenic drug that slowly nibbled at your mind, turning you into an unpredictable monster. The corners of her vision darkened, and her inner voice grew more and more distant as something more sinister and wild sought to break free.

Ann never really thought about Lindwyrm’s urges. She just thought it liked the taste of human flesh, just like any regular old folklore dragon. <strong>Not even close</strong>. Wearing its skin and sharing its instincts, she intimately understood the insatiable hunger and relentless yearning for human flesh that had driven the beast. It was a primal desire she could barely comprehend, a dark revelation that left her both awestruck and apprehensive. It didn&#39;t just have a taste for human flesh, as one might savor a favorite dish. Its craving for it was as unyielding as our need for air, an all-consuming yearning that left no room for doubt or restraint.

Her eyes were almost bloodshot as her nose picked up the scent of the people in the bar. As it picked up her own scent. The thought of taking a small nibble out of her forearms flashed across her mind, the thought repulsing and attracting her at the same time.

Was she really going to give up on a childhood dream that everyone looked down upon, yet meant more to her than anything else in this dirty, shitty, god-forsaken world?

“...damn right.” With immense effort, she smirked, keeping her teeth gritted as she turned away from Lindwyrm and grabbed her gig bag from the ground. &quot;I ain&#39;t finished, not by a long shot. Had to adjust to that craving for blood, that&#39;s it. It ain&#39;t even a warm-up... let&#39;s go, Lindy.&quot;

With a wicked chuckle, she seized her baseball bat, scraping it menacingly against the bar’s wall, her laughter mingling with the anticipation of the impending massacre that was about to happen.

Out of the corner of his eye he watched Roland settle into his seat, looking somewhat unwell. Oddly, the sight of the blonde&#39;s unease calmed him down more than he cared to admit. He raised his glass again, before turning his attention back to his Servant.

A deafening roar crashed through the paper thin walls of the bar, drowning their conversation and rattling the bottles. Roland almost dropped his drink; Lachlan grabbed the nearest bottle, then started topping up all three of their glasses.

I&#39;m not a fucking knight in shining armor!&quot; Bill almost spat out his drink at Lachlan&#39;s suggestion. &quot;I can only do things the way I can, which sadly ya won&#39;t find very heroic.&quot; He said with an irregular cadence, before his words were silenced by a thundering boom.

<em>GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRL</em>

A roar, loud enough to crack glass and shatter wood. The room trembled, Roland mimicking its movements from how stirred he was. Lachlan kept it cool, tossing another joke as he filled up the shaking glasses.

&quot;Hit &#39;em where it hurts?&quot; Bill couldn&#39;t stifle his laughter. Bill Cook always gave him unreasonable demands, but Lachlan had already surpassed that asswipe&#39;s ego ages ago. &quot;Sure thing, chief. Tell you what: I&#39;ll watch and let ya know how badly that goes for us.&quot;

<em>clink</em>

He raised his glass, saluting his Master before swallowing it all in one gulp. 

&quot;I ain&#39;t going down with you fools, not when I&#39;m so close to the finish line. I&#39;m sure ya know that.&quot; Bill reaffirmed. &quot;So don&#39;t make me look bad.&quot;

<em>clunk</em>

He placed his glass back on the counter, now empty and pristine. He scanned the room, noticing the shifting in shadows as vibrations coursed across the wooden surface. Whatever was out there was getting closer.

&quot;Took an entire army to get Achilles&#39; heel. At least, that&#39;s what I heard.&quot; Bill noted. &quot;You&#39;re not an army, but-&quot;

Archer leaned closer, whispering in his Master&#39;s ear. The act was unexpected, but clearly Bill feared someone eavesdropping in. Once Lachlan heard the full contents, he understood what his Servant meant.

<em>&quot;Ya know the Master, so go after them. Act like we&#39;re too chickenshit to try attacking the dragon. Godzilla gonna try to protect their Master of course and then-&quot;</em>

He formed a finger gun.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1154901937964204112 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1154901937964204112><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, September 22, 2023 5:07 PM">5:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;-I find the heel.&quot; He leaned back, now speaking normally. This was the most prep they needed. No grand plans, just instincts. There was no need to talk things out, because the implications were already there. If the Master was already out of position? Lachlan should take his chance and kill her. Same for Bill. Likewise, if Lachlan noticed a gaping weakness in the dragon&#39;s body, he should take his chance.

There was no need to assign roles when both Master and Servant were equally hungry to win.

&quot;Now, all that&#39;s left is-&quot; Bill turned around, glaring at the elephant in the room.

Roland.

Its spirit had swelled after their earlier combined warcry, but the excitement had now grown somewhat stale in the awkward silence that followed. Ann had made mention of foes to be fought, but in the argument that followed, it would appear that the beast had forgotten whether or not she shared with it their location. Something about the bar perhaps? But the bar was right in front of it, and no enemies seemed near. Neither had its presence lured them out of hiding, so could it be that they had fled?

A low growl escaped its throat as it cursed them for spoiling its sport, and lacking patience, it acted immediately to remedy the issue. Although perhaps it would have been smarter to simply ask Ann again?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“We shall seek our prey from the skies!”</code>

Sparing no second thought, Lindwyrm lurched forward and swept its Master off her legs with its lowered wings, lifting her high into the air and causing her to slide down towards its back. Taking little to no time to make sure its reckless maneuver had worked, it proceeded to leap into the sky after using a nearby building to launch itself, its wings propelling it ever higher as it seemingly abandoned the bar and began to circle the surrounding area like a vulture, its hungry gaze fixed downwards.

Having always relied on having its meals brought to it in life, it was likely that it perhaps wasn’t the greatest tracker.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, September 25, 2023 7:39 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her wild and colorful hair whipped around like a tornado, blocking her sight until they leveled off, the dragon tracking prey from above like a bird of prey.

What a rush! Blazing through the air, hunting from the skies, free as a bird. Was that how Lindwyrm lived daily? If so, she should&#39;ve known better than to keep it on a tight leash. That lifestyle was fucking awesome, and now she&#39;d taste it herself with their next target.

&quot;I can&#39;t spot &#39;em!&quot; She screamed into its ear, clutching the back of its neck tight. &quot;They gotta be close... there!&quot;

She yanked the beast by the horns, aiming its head at the bar.

If their enemies hid in that den like rats, they would simply uproot their nest and make it their own, and should they have already fled, they would have laid claim on enough drink to forget about their missed confrontation.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">&quot;As you wish!&quot;</code>

Answering its Master&#39;s bloodlust with its own, it halted its flight midair, pressing its wings close to its flank and shielding Ann beneath their flexible webbing, before giving itself to the pull of gravity and plummeting towards the earth. Only its tail was needed to steer itself at this point, it&#39;s eyes fixed on the bar below, as it descended upon it like a silver comet. Its breath gathered in its lungs, the sharp whistling of air sliced by its folded wings the only warning of their approach.
And just like that, mirroring its first welcome to Berenice, it arrived in a violent impact of shattered rock and ice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What was the worst that could happen? With a trembling hand, Roland moved closer to the window and pressed against it, feeling the chilling cold seeping into his bones. 

&#39;Where is it?&#39; Came an almost idiotic question. Roland shivered again, but this time it wasn&#39;t from the cold. The dragon&#39;s roar still echoed in his ears, but as he put his forehead against the glass, all he could see was—</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The dragon had not left. It had merely repositioned itself for a better angle of attack, attempting to ensnare them from the sky.

<em>CRASH!</em>

The world came crashing down, crushed by the shadow of the gigantic beast. Roland had already made himself scarce, thanks to Lachlan&#39;s timely intervention. Bill had already disappeared in double the time, his body completely blending into the shadows that Lindwyrm has so graciously provided. Not like it mattered, since he wouldn&#39;t be there long.

<em>&quot;Got it, boss. I&#39;ll trust ya to stay safe and avoid anything stupid.&quot;</em> Bill&#39;s thoughts filtered through as Lachlan felt his Servant&#39;s presence grow lighter. No doubt Archer had vanished into his spirit form and was currently repositioning himself, trying to find the best location to strike. The first shot wasn&#39;t only one that counted: It was the most important one. If they fucked it up, well-

<em>&quot;...I want a good look at its eyes.&quot;</em> Archer whispered. This wasn&#39;t just trash talk; it was a command. If Lindwyrm&#39;s tunnel vision was a weakness, then he planned to turn it into an even more crippling curse. A blind dragon was probably about ten times better than dealing with a dragon that could see. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Although there was no building left to hide in, one could argue that visibility had only gotten worse in turn, providing no shortage of cracks and shadows for vermin to scuttle around, gaps and openings too small for Lindwyrm’s lumbering body to fit into.

Once the reckless impact of its landing had passed, the beast shook of the junk that had collected on its body and unfurled its wings, freeing its Master from their embrace, before it began to lumber to the odd corpse or two, their shorn and lacerated limbs sticking out from the rubble like flagpoles to mark their graves. Bringing its nose close to them, it curiously lapped up their blood after relishing the intoxicating scent.

Debris and frost exploded all around them, a festival of colors and grim that befitted their savage arrival into battle. 

Ann hopped off the creature’s back as it unfurled the wings it had used to protect her, landing on her two feet on the ground. Her senses tingled as she smelled the scent of blood in the air, its sweetness surpassing even the most fragrant of flowers. She glanced at her dragon licking up some of it from a lifeless body on the ground, and couldn’t help but feel a little envious. 

Her eyes darted wildly as she scanned their surroundings, a manic, wide grin stretched across her face.&quot;I don&#39;t see &#39;em either, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves. Those guys survived a damn crash from ten thousand feet up, didn&#39;t they? Ain&#39;t no way they died from that.&quot;

The bar was a complete mess. Blood, frost and corpses laid scattered about… save for a couple of suspiciously intact tables. Ann’s grin widened as she dragged her baseball bat on the ground, the screeching noise raising tension, and stalked over to one of the two tables. She slammed her boot onto its edge with brutal force, turning to face Lindwyrm. “Think they&#39;re stupid enough to be hiding under these tables? Or are they just chicken shit?&quot;

&quot;LET&#39;S FIND OUT!&quot; She snarled and kicked the table <em>hard</em>, propelling the table across the room with inhuman strength. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, she brought her bat crashing down toward the concealed figure underneath, not even sparing an appraising look at them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t get lost in its beauty now!&gt;</em> He joked with his own thoughts as Archer distanced himself from the periphery of his consciousness. The eyes were always a vulnerable spot, especially for a creature of such impressive size; it was practically a walking bullseye! However, that was precisely why, if they knew it, the enemy likely knew as well. Would Berserker have anything up their metaphorical sleeves to protect their weak spots?

That was for Cherokee Bill to find out. Lachlan, on the other hand, had a more pressing matter at hand. While the reinforced table had protected this section of the bar from total ruin, it had also presented another problem: an extremely <em>outstanding</em> one, so to speak, as the less damage they received...

Lachlan eyed Roland, who had covered his own mouth with shaking hands and was keeping absolutely still as the footsteps approached.

<em><strong>&#39;LET&#39;S FIND OUT!&#39;</strong></em>

...Staying here was starting to feel like a very bad idea!

The table was violently overturned. Beams of dim light filtered through the cracks, soon to be covered by Ann&#39;s royal garb as she caught the mousey mages squarely in the trap they had set and foolishly ensnared themselves in. Without even a word of greeting, she swung her bat down towards the figure in the black coat—

There was no response.

Lachlan&#39;s body barely flinched as the tip of the bat rammed itself in the back of his skull, which felt meatier than normal, and rather shiny and smooth. Had the Dowling kid gone bald from the stress?

As Ann drew her bat back, &#39;Lachlan&#39; retaliated.

The black-clad figure moved in perfect synchrony with Ann&#39;s advance, pulling away where she thrusted forward and pressing in where her form had faltered—this time, it was her poorly guarded foot. A second clawed hand swiped menacingly towards her ankle, aiming to either cleave it in half or, at the very least, to catch hold of it and bring her crashing down to their own level: the splintered floor.

Several cracks poked through the floorboards beneath them, too large to be caused by Ann&#39;s reckless swinging and too deliberate to be caused by Lindwyrm&#39;s crushing weight. It became apparent that the floor had been tampered with, and underneath was the top of a stairway that descended down into the depths of some cavity that smelled of a musty dampness and the all too familiar notes of wine and spirits.

Lachlan had clearly been there, so screams of pain were what Bill had reflexively expected.

Instead, there was silence. But that alone was an answer to Bill&#39;s ears. He couldn&#39;t help but smile. <em>&lt;Well, I&#39;ll be damned. First time I saw a noble play the role of a rat so well!&gt;</em> He delivered an underhanded compliment to his Master, before taking action. It wouldn&#39;t be long until that loud harpy of a Master realized that her prey had escaped. Those repulsive movements, severed floorboards and scrapes on the bat were enough for Bill to make an educated guess on who was the figure in the black coat.

<em>&lt;Send yer puppet a message for me,&gt;</em> Archer warned, having already taken position within the shadows of the bar. Corpses and debris weren&#39;t enough to stall him. If anything, he felt grateful to the dragon for offering such ample cover for him to sneak in.

Ann didn&#39;t know this, but she was already within the range of certain death.

<em>&lt;tell Dancer to-&gt;</em>

<em><strong>&lt;Watch out for friendly fire.&gt;</strong></em>

No sound. No flash. A silent killer that had been fired without Ann or Lindwyrm perceiving it. Half a second later, Ann felt like a wrecking ball had just hit her stomach, her insides spinning like a missile was launching from her intestines and ready to explode. If she looked down, she would notice that one of her hides had been pierced through, a gaping hole with a small piece of...lead? Inside?

It dropped down to the floor, and then Ann understood what it truly was: A bullet. A bullet with no name.

They were already being hunted. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In an instant the beast was upon their shared foe.

Scrambling in haste, each of its limbs lacking coordination in a chaotic hurry to bring itself before the grotesque creature, it was in no state to note the subtle hints of their enemy’s presence strewn about in its environment. In its raging rampage it rushed to its Master&#39;s side by taking the shortest route, inevitably placing it atop the weakest point separating the bar from its basement storage, causing the entire floor to collapse in its failed attempt to lend aid.

In an effort to catch itself it extended its tail and wings, though the cramped hole only caused it to further shatter the support beams holding the floor aloft as it pummeled into the lower level, its raging screams comically cut off as it disappeared from sight.

But not for long.

The chemical stench of Lachlan’s creation was unmistakable to Lindwyrm’s sensitive nose, marking it as a smell even more unpleasant than Ann’s cigarettes, and thus it forwent the accuracy granted to it by its sight and tracked its quarry by its scent alone.
Bursting from the floorboard like a raging geyser, the beast was a storm of fang and claw, still slightly disoriented from its fall and thus relying on its size to hit its target by chance.

Driven by instinct as it was, it remained oblivious to the injury suffered by its Master, blind to the shot fired by Archer from the shadows.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An appraising glance at the figure she hit over the head confirmed it wasn’t Lachlan, but some kind of putrid zombie-like thing who’s rotten smell made her nose wrinkle in disgust. 

“Who the fuck are you?!” Ann barked as it lunged at her poorly protected foot with outstretched claws, sinking them into her flesh. In an animal-like movement, she spinned around abruptly, tearing her wounded foot free from the undead grip, leaving gashes behind that <em>should’ve</em> been more serious. Where’d her increased durability come from?

She gave Dancer a predatory glance as she winded back for retaliation, before Lindwyrm rushed to her aid. Ann launched herself backward as it lashed at the threat impeding her, her body executing a dynamic somersault, leaving the zombie to confront her dragon.

But danger persisted as Bill&#39;s bullet violently struck her stomach. Though her cloak absorbed most of the impact, her gut still ached painfully. That would definitely leave a bruise tomorrow morning. Her head frantically darted in all directions, hunting for her hidden assailant, but finding jack. “Like Master, like Servant. You cowardly fucks!!”

Amidst the chaos, Ann leaped and landed behind the bar, crouching low and taking cover amidst the shattered glasses and abandoned drinks. The barman’s body laid on the ground right next to her, but instead of remorse or repulsion, she felt like taking a nibble… but not now. With a sly grin, she peeled off his bowtie, snagged one of few intact booze bottles, and slid away from the bar, jumping down the colossal hole Lindwyrm left in the ground.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lindwyrm&#39;s chubby belly poked through the opening, and for a moment both the puppeteer and his assistant pressed themselves flat against the wall, quiet and unmoving.

But then the dragon relented. Whatever thoughts were coursing through its massive brain had led it to pursue its quarry aboveground rather than below. 

<em>&lt;I think the Dancer has attracted quite the unusual suitor. Don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have any issues hitting this one!&gt;</em> Hastily, Lachlan commanded the Dancer to halt its pursuit of Ann. If Berserker was after his puppet, then the last thing he wanted was to bring its hunting ground to the basement. Instead, he placed a simple order in the puppet&#39;s hyper tuned brain:

Prioritize survival.

The Dancer lacked the speed of its eight-legged sibling, but a race against a dragon was not its objective this time. In the cramped and chaotic space, there would be plenty of room for other maneuvers: crevices to conceal itself in, tunnels to dig, bodies to hind behind, and furniture to use as a makeshift projectile. 

It wasn&#39;t aware that Lindwyrm was tracking it by its scent, however.

With its claws, the puppet effortlessly cleared a path through the clutter and set off in what it considered the safest direction: towards the rough location of Lachlan&#39;s <em>other</em> Servant.

In other words, Cherokee Bill.

Meanwhile, a much smaller body hopped down into the basement, clutching several bottles. She was bleeding from the scratches along her ankle, but was otherwise full of life. She had also swapped her previous attire for something more pristine, which contrasted starkly with her unruly demeanor.

He simultaneously ribbed Bill. <em>&lt;I thought you were an expert at taking potshots?&gt;</em>

Clearly, Bill had either missed its mark, or the punk woman had miraculously defended herself against a Servant. Lachlan dug out his revolver. &#39;I think <em>I&#39;m</em> going take a crack at this,&#39;

And fired.

The gunshot reverberated within the small cellar. Roland winced as the noise stung his ears, but Lachlan kept his eyes on his prize. He <em>had</em> to know, how Berserker&#39;s Master managed to deal with Bill&#39;s bullet—whether by pure dumb luck or some other means.

The bullet zoomed straight for Ann&#39;s chest.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1163236864648548442 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1163236864648548442><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, October 15, 2023 5:08 PM">5:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

“So that&#39;s where you were. Little rat hiding in the fucking cellar.” She spat on the floor in his direction, her immaculate cloak gracefully shifting and fluttering around as if caught in a breeze. “That zombie thing upstairs’s yours, isn’t it? Pretty messed up. And what’s this about taking a crack-”

Her eyes widened as Lachlan slipped a hand inside his vest, the beat of her heart stopping for one second. Her legs quickly moved out of self-preservation, but not only was the maneuver unexpected, there was also no hesitation in Lachlan’s movement. She couldn&#39;t react in time.

<strong>Bang!</strong> The bullet buried itself in her. She looked down at her chest, her hand letting go of her bat as she instinctively felt the struck area for blood… only to feel a bent piece of lead stuck in the scaly creases. The bullet could not pierce Lindwyrm’s hide. A wicked grin spread on her face. 

“Did I dress up just for you?” She scoffed as her hands worked on the booze bottle, swapping the cork with the bartender’s unfurled bow. “Nah. You ain’t that special, Dowling!”

The bottle of alcohol was fashioned into a makeshift <em>Molotov cocktail</em>, the tip of which she ignited with a flick of the lighter. She threw the Molotov at him, though he wasn&#39;t the target so much as <em>the spilled alcohol and broken bottles lying behind him and at his feet</em>, which had broken down after Lindwyrm&#39;s violent stunts.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Right after Bill&#39;s shot had collided, the floor started to break down. Lindwyrm had descended even further down, causing a total collapse of the bar&#39;s poor infrastructure and exposing the route to the cellar that Lachlan had used to get away. Knowing that, Ann skipped ahead, leaving her Servant behind in order to finish matters herself.

<em>whirrr</em>

Cold mana spun around the gun&#39;s cylinder, restoring the bullet count to six. Archer did not need to reload his gun to fire multiple times: It was all mana fed directly by his Master. But old habits died hard, and he felt more at ease with reloading his shots manually than relying on the abilities he had acquired as a Heroic Spirit. His pistol felt the same way, coating any ammo in a mana encased shell to increase its destructive power.

To be a Servant is akin to being reborn anew. The opportunities for new paths in life are endless, to make up for past mistakes or end up with a completely different answer than what you had achieved in life. Yet the more things change, the more they stay the same. In Bill&#39;s case, he was a big fan of not breaking things if they already worked. His motto for killing in the past should still apply to anything from the present day. One shot, one kill.

<em>Then why was Ann still alive?</em>

Bill knew that the shot had collided. He had predicted it, seen it and felt it. There was no way that he had missed, not even in that chaos. Yet his Master&#39;s thoughts echoing in his nerves caused a thick vein to appear on his forehead.

<em>&lt;I shot her, that&#39;s for sure. Maybe she&#39;s a ghost-&gt;</em> The dragon was snarling, chasing after the Dancer like a rabid dog. Bill paid it no mind, staying hidden in the shadows. Instead, his eyes zoomed in, filtering through every spent cigarette and broken glass shard for a single bullet.

He found it in three seconds. Child&#39;s play for an Archer. No traces of flesh, nor blood. Just a huge dent.

<em>It didn&#39;t pierce the skin.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1163934292636872784 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1163934292636872784><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, October 17, 2023 3:19 PM">3:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;Bullets won&#39;t work. Not yours at least.&gt;</em> He hastily warned, his voice growing bitter by the second.<em>&lt;She tanked that bullet and lived through it!&gt;</em> He was furious, having broken one of the few rules in his life: Don&#39;t waste more than a single bullet on a fucking-

<em>CRASH!</em>

&quot;The hell is that dragon doi-&quot; He mumbled to himself, thinking that he was safe in his little cranny. He would be, if it weren&#39;t for the Dancer running straight towards him, while the Berserker chased after it. To tell the truth, he couldn&#39;t even tell if that was the case, since all he saw was gigantic nails and fangs. It was a macabre combination of teeth and flesh, enough to swallow him and the Dancer whole if he let it get close enough. Hiding was no longer an option.

<em>&quot;If I die, it&#39;s yer fuckin&#39; fault. Fuck all Dowlings.&quot;</em> He kept that thought to himself and hopefully his boss wasn&#39;t nosy enough to pry. Archer scurried out on all fours, still out of Berserker&#39;s sight for now. Dancer had almost reached its destination, just a few feet away from Cherokee Bill. The latter wondered what Lachlan&#39;s plan was to order the puppet to lead the dragon back to him, but then he slowly realized.

Lindwyrm was rising up, but it was unaware of Archer&#39;s presence yet. First, a hand. Then, an arm. Chest, neck, head-

Eye.

Once he saw his target, he didn&#39;t need to think anymore. He immediately fired.

<em>BANG!</em>

This shot could be heard. He had to do it out in the open, after all. Because of that, he didn&#39;t hold back.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

All twelve bullets, straight towards Lindwyrm&#39;s exposed left eye. To the dragon, it felt like a fly had just flown inside its pupil. An irritating and painful sensation. With their vision partially blurred, it felt tempting to just lash out even more. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Where there was no space for its erratically flailing wings, it would use its fangs and claws to carve said space out of the unyielding rock. Fixtures and furnishings were crushed beneath its <s>chubby</s>, <s>healthy</s>, pleasantly plump size, leaving an unmistakable trail that seemed to lead it to one place in particular, the destination decided by the nimble dancer that had so far been able to use the wrecked battlefield’s many obstacles to its advantage in staying out of the serpent’s reach.

Then. Finally. The puppet’s movements slowed, as if having made it to its goal, allowing Lindwyrm the perfect opportunity to finally put an end to its maddening chase.
Its limbs swelled, readying themselves to jump, fang-lined maw stretching wide open to rip the creature apart.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“Begone, you foul-!”</code>

And yet its attack was halted. Twelve deafening blasts rang out, loud enough to rob the world of sound and substance, though those only preceded the worst to come. Not just deafened, but blinded too, Lindwyrm belatedly realized, as its mind was set ablaze in a biting torrent of agony caused by the rupturing of its left eye, the splattering of its red hot blood forming all too noticeable a pattern on its brilliant white scales, sullying them in a tarnished red spray that spilled forth unabated.

Too ruthless. Leaving the beast nary a moment to register what had happened before it crashed headfirst into the space just occupied by Lachlan’s familiar, its writhing body continuing its disgraceful tumble until it hit the nearby wall and rocked the basement&#39;s foundations to their core. Though not quite comparable to a natural quake, to those yet unaware of the fight on the surface it may have well been one.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">“You…”</code>

How quick this shooter was to target its vulnerable flesh, deliberately aiming for what little of it was left exposed by its manifold hide. No coincidence was this, but a calculated act. That of a hunter stalking its prey. Only it was now Lindwyrm that was being hunted.

That, it refused to accept.

Rearing its head from the wreckage of its fall, it released its anger and frustration, its determined will to reject the notion of someone other than its bride seeking to stand above it, in a deafening roar loud enough to drown the battlefield in its wrath, a rage that was cold and unforgiving as ice, a storm of shredding hail unleashed into the general direction of where the gunshots had first rung out.
With its vision now dyed crimson and reduced by half, it could no longer rely on the luxury of accuracy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
