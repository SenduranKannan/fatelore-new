Most of the regulars at the tables in the back recognised her, some as the woman who had been drinking and snoring at the bar for a week straight, others as the crazy drunk who fought with a scrawny white-haired kid in the middle of the bar while spewing incoherent nonsense. Whispers of her legendary brawl and legendary drinking spread quickly through the air, creating an atmosphere of anticipation as she calmly walked towards the empty counter and took a sit. Despite being the source of it, she seemed impervious to the rising tension, showing a tranquil smile on her face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was pretty nice.&quot;

She glanced at the numerous bottles the bartender had placed behind the bar, obviously preparing for yet another of her drinking binges. She made a dismissive gesture with her hand to get his attention.

&quot;Oh, no, no, I&#39;ll just have a single shot of whiskey tonight.&quot; She stopped him, raising an index finger. &quot;Twerp&#39;s waiting for me outside, I don&#39;t want to keep him waiting too long.&quot; 

The barman slowly nodded, looking quite disappointed as he grabbed a glass and poured some whiskey into it, then pushed it towards her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just as Ann was about to reach for her drink, another hand swooped in and claimed the glass, covering it with their palm and swiftly pulling it towards themselves. A red-haired individual dressed in dark attire sat beside her, engrossed in a conversation with a blonde man nearby. Without even sparing a glance at the glass, he raised it to his lips—

&#39;The hell is this?&#39; Lachlan coughed, examining the amber liquid in the glass. &#39;This isn&#39;t what I ordered,&#39; he scowled, then passed it along to the blonde man seated next to him. &#39;Since when did you become a fan of whiskey?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She instinctively lunged and gripped his collar, a scowl stretched deep into her face at this asshat who had just ruined her perfect night.

Then their eyes locked, the two wordlessly acknowledging their bitter history. Tension hung heavy in the air for a few seconds, an unspoken war of disdain and defiance fought through their stares. She relaxed her grip, leaving his ruined collar to raise three fingers at the bartender.

“Three whiskeys. The strongest you have.”

The bartender, visibly uncomfortable, nodded and produced another three shots of whiskey, which he began to place in front of her, then Lachlan and Rol-

“Nope.” She stopped him, her voice sharp. “All three are for me.” She leaned over to Lachlan and reached behind him with her arm, their faces coming dangerously close to touching as she grabbed his and his mate’s drink and swiftly pulled them to her side of the bar.

She grabbed a drink and raised it to her mouth, maintaining intense eye contact with the red-haired man as the fiery liquid ignited her throat.

“You’re the guys from the plane. The hijackers.” She slammed the glass down on the counter, the sharp noise causing more than a head in the bar to turn towards them. She grabbed a second drink. “I’d say I’m glad you survived the crash, but I’d be lying.” Then she downed its contents in one go.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though I have to say, without that dragon by your side, you don&#39;t seem like much.&#39;

When Ann claimed the newly prepared drinks, he let her. A rap of his knuckle on the counter signaled the bartender that he was still waiting for his own drink. The bartender, of course, was more than glad to busy himself, which suited Lachlan just fine. The blatant gawking of the onlookers was beyond his control, but then again, since when had he ever been unaccustomed to some attention from the public?

&#39;If anything, the surprise is all mine. Don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re still involved in the War after that intense manhunt, huh?&#39;

Of course, he was undoubtedly alluding to all the reports featured across the local news network detailing Ann and Berserker&#39;s &#39;adventures&#39;, along with intel extracted from other Masters involved in the War. Though it was customary for Masters and their Servants to maintain a certain level of discretion, Ann had been anything <em>but</em>.

Every word he said sounded smug and arrogant, and she <em>hated</em> smug and arrogant assholes. &quot;I&#39;m not the most stealthy person in the world, and frankly, I couldn’t care less. <em>Lindwyrm doesn&#39;t leave witnesses behind</em>.&quot;

A statement that wasn&#39;t entirely true, as she was talking to two of those witnesses right now. Seeing no point in keeping everyone&#39;s tensions at bay, she removed her Mystic Eye Killers and freed her hazel eyes from their thaumaturgic prison.

Though her face remained still, if a little pissed, her eyes widened in a mixture of surprise and realisation at his last sentence. He knew about the War. He was a Magus... no, not only that, but if he had flown to Berenice at such a crucial time, he <em>had</em> to be a Master. His survival of the plane crash, and the fact that he had kept track of Lindwyrm&#39;s activities, suddenly made a lot more sense. Just her luck.

But there was one thing he couldn&#39;t know. Lindwyrm was dead, but her Servant was alive... and indeed, she could sense a slight dizziness from his use of Magecraft, indicating that he was still waiting for her outside.

The man was right. Without him at her side, she not only looked, but straight up <em>was</em> a lot less threatening. Which was exactly why she needed to reunite with him as soon as possible, if not to escape, then to prepare to fuck that smug prick&#39;s shit up. And the first step to doing that would be to choose her words <em>carefully</em>.

&quot;For a bunch of secret society people, I seem to run into you <em>Magi</em> quite often these days. Bunch of fucking cockroaches.&quot; She raised her third shot to her lips, the fiery liquid cascading down her throat, a wince briefly distorting her features. &quot;And I suppose it was only a matter of time before one of them screwed it all up for me. You’re right. My dragon’s no more. Boo fucking hoo.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

After all, any Master who had been disqualified from the War should have no reason to keep their Servant&#39;s identity concealed. Ann didn&#39;t even give the impression of someone well-versed in Magecraft; didn&#39;t act or look the part. Rather, she seemed more interested in rattling the person in front of her than in the War itself.

In many ways, Ann seemed like an accidental participant, someone who had been swept into the War by either luck, or mistake. Though losing out early would have undoubtedly stung, it wasn&#39;t a big enough deal—at least, nothing a couple of drinks couldn&#39;t fix.

That was Lachlan&#39;s impression, at least. And that made her inconsequential—a nonissue. No longer would her actions have any impact on his course of action...

...Or she could simply be putting on a convincing act. 

&#39;My condolences,&#39; Lachlan replied placidly, a bland and insincere remark. &#39;But perhaps if you stayed far away from Berenice, I would have avoided running into <em>you</em>. The Grail is due to manifest on this island, of course it&#39;d turn into a gathering place for Magi like myself.&#39;

He ended the sentence with a raised pitch, as if he was asking an obvious question.

&#39;So why are you still here?&#39; An actual question this time. Lachlan was beginning to loosen up, offering a rather condescending smile as he started to probe the woman, searching her face for signs of deceit. &#39;You are now irrelevant to the War. Wouldn&#39;t it be in your best interest to get away as far as possible?&#39;

He glanced sideways at Roland, followed by a brief pause. Then his whole personality seemed to light up.

&quot;What do you care if I stay here?&quot; She replied with the same high inflection Lachlan had used before, as if what she was saying was so obvious that it didn&#39;t need to be said. &quot;Did it ever occur to you that... oh, I don&#39;t know... none of what I fucking do is any of your fucking business, huh?&quot;

She leaned over to look at the sorry excuse of an assistant Lachlan had brought with him, then looked back at the beaming Lachlan, the disgust he had inspired in her practically oozing out of her eyes. With sheer force of will, she conjured up an unsettling, strained grin at the puppeteer.

&quot;Keep your assistant. You two look so <em>cute</em> together.&quot; She gritted her teeth. &quot;I&#39;m already mad enough that I can&#39;t wish my film sequel into existence anymore... if I travel with anyone now, I think I might crash a second plane into the ground.

Well, okay, maybe that was a bit harsh, considering that he and Ann—

&#39;—did survive an incredibly intimate life-or-death situation together, that we did.&#39; His smile was all teeth, even though it didn&#39;t quite reach his eyes. &#39;Can&#39;t a guy be concerned about the well-being of his former competitor for once?&#39;

Of course, it would be incredibly presumptuous to assume that his words carried a trace of genuine concern. After all, the art of making small talk and empty promises was just one of the many assets Lachlan liked to use to get what he wanted. It would have been ideal if he could sway the woman, of course...

&#39;Or I could put you out of your misery right here. What <em>I</em> choose do is also none of your fucking business, right?&#39;

...but alas, his honesty got the better of him. There was no way he could ever commit to charming someone as abrasive as Ann!

Nevertheless, one thing was certain: Lachlan found himself relishing in this pointless exchange more than he cared to admit. Roland seemed rather mortified as he finally freed himself from Lachlan&#39;s grasp, muttering something about &#39;witnesses&#39;, but his concern seemed to fly right over his boss&#39;s head.

&#39;A filmmaker, huh.&#39; He scrutinized Ann once again, though neither her attire nor her gig bag gave any indication of her belonging to that field. &#39;Can&#39;t say that I&#39;m convinced.

From cold, restrained anger to... whatever his unsettling smile and condescending cheerfulness were meant to convey. It reminded her of the old days, when people&#39;s attitudes would do a 180 just because she looked at them for too long. Like snakes shedding their skins, revealing the filth that lay beneath their fake masks.

It was a bit nostalgic, really. And proof that even the Magi who thought so highly of themselves, who thought they were above all these commoners... were no better than the very commoners they despised and looked down upon.

&quot;Better yet, I can play you a tune after I smash my guitar over your head. No charge.&quot; She <em>chuckled</em>, her restrained smile relaxing into a haughty grin, not unlike the one Lachlan was currently displaying. She reached into her jacket and pulled out a cigarette, placing it between her lips. &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m not a filmmaker.

Yes... she almost <em>enjoyed</em> her anger.

She lit her cigarette and looked with unbridled amusement at the stress ball in the form of a blonde man behind Lachlan. Her eyes followed his uncomfortable glances, to the reserved crowd listening to their conversation with a mixture of confusion and unease. Funny how they hadn&#39;t gotten used to it after her last altercation with Prince. Her gaze returned to Lachlan as she took a drag on her cigarette and exhaled through her nose.

&quot;What about you?&quot; She looked him up and down a few times, pausing at his strange shirt. &quot;Can&#39;t say your eighteenth century look tells me anything about you, you look like any other arrogant pencil-dick Magi.

I don&#39;t think this is a fight you want to initiate.&#39;

His gaze momentarily lingered on Ann&#39;s freshly lit cigarette. &#39;However,&#39; he continued flippantly, dragging his eyes back to Ann, &#39;what you <em>can</em> do is offer me a smoke and hope that&#39;s enough to make me look the other way. Hell, I&#39;ll even pretend to know who this Ferris Bueller fellow is and enduring your gushing over him for the next...&#39;

He checked the clock on the wall. &#39;You&#39;ve got <strong>ten minutes</strong>,&#39; he declared, then began to rummage through his own pocket. He remained silent as Ann threw him a question, raising an eye in response.

&#39;Don&#39;t lump me in with those Clock Tower assholes. I recently had the displeasure of meeting one, and I can&#39;t say that I was his biggest fan. What I&#39;m looking for is none of your business,&#39; he said with furrowed brows. &#39;You&#39;re no magus, but you&#39;re certainly nosy like one.&#39;

From his pocket emerged a pack of cigarettes (The audacity of today&#39;s youth! Absolutely horrendous!). He promptly selected one, rolling it between his fingers as he contemplated Ann&#39;s words further.

Should he mess with her further? Or put an end to it? He had originally come to the bar to sort things out with Roland, before proceeding to the Church. However, the presence of Ann had made that nearly impossible. With the Grail so close to manifesting, the last thing he should be doing was squandering precious time like this.

<em>But why the hell not?</em> His own voice spoke in his mind. It wasn&#39;t as if he <em>needed</em> to hurry. After all, what significance did the Grail hold for him?

Heads so far up your own asses that you can&#39;t even see eye to eye with your peers.&quot;

Ignoring the purpose of the empty glasses in front of her, Ann nonchalantly turned one of them into an impromptu ashtray, flicking the ash from her cigarette into the glass. She glanced vaguely at the clock behind her, trying not to look too interested.

Ten minutes. She couldn&#39;t tell if that was too short or too long. Though she was enjoying this casual and nonsensical banter more than she cared to admit, it didn&#39;t change the fact that Prince was still waiting for her outside, nor the fact that she absolutely <em>had</em> to get to him... but at the same time, she&#39;d dispelled any suspicions the man might have had about her. It wasn&#39;t like she was working on <em>borrowed</em> time, since Prince was indistinguishable from any normal human. It made little difference if he wanted to continue the conversation for another five, minutes, or even an hour!

...and sure, Prince might be a little angry at her for keeping him waiting so long, but that kind of selfishness wasn&#39;t too different from what she put him through on a regular basis. He&#39;d be fine, she thought as she tried to enjoy the last few minutes she had with the redheaded bastard.

She looked up at his face, suddenly aware of his youthful appearance, and couldn&#39;t help but cackle in an undignified manner. &quot;So young and already a smoker! Ha, you&#39;ve got a bright future ahead of you, kid.&quot; 

Then came his little deal, the satisfaction of which he didn&#39;t bother to hide. She wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> interested in his reasons, her earlier question little more than small talk, with little thought put into it... and yet she found herself inexplicably drawn to the little game he was playing, which was so clearly meant to be some kind of a powerplay. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; She smiled teasingly, a playful gleam in her hazel eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t move.&quot;

Instead of reaching into her pockets for her lighter, she leaned against him, bringing the tip of her lit cigarette tantalisingly close to the tip of his until they touched. Their eyes locked again for that brief moment, the punk exuding a confident ease, reveling in the charged tension that brewed with their faces so close together... before Lachlan&#39;s cigarette finally lit, and Ann nonchalantly pulled away.

&quot;There.&quot; She took an invigorating drag from her cigarette and continued as if nothing had happened. &quot;Go on. I&#39;m listening.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s hard to get ahead if you worry too much about the welfare of the others.&#39;

He took Ann&#39;s accusation in stride. It didn&#39;t even sound like an accusation in the first place—not to him, at least. Though he hadn&#39;t chosen to be born into his family, it still shaped him, became his way of life. Growing up surrounded by Magi had alienated him from the normal principles of...say, a bartender trying very hard to mind his own business at the other end of the counter.

And besides, who was to say that these so-called &#39;common rabble&#39; were any better?

He glanced sideways at Roland and pulled his lips into a wry smile. &#39;You should know this best, huh?&#39; He took a jab at the blonde man. &#39;After all, you&#39;ve experienced the best of both worlds, the Magi&#39;s and the commoners&#39;. Not so different, are they?&#39;

He held out his cigarette as Ann leaned in closer. Despite the fact that she had threatened to bash his head in numerous times since they had recognized each other, he couldn&#39;t resist letting the danger of inviting her into his personal space linger a bit longer. He didn&#39;t consider himself a thrill-seeker, but somehow, between watching Roland&#39;s increasing concern, the noise of the dingy bar, and the fellow (former?) Master who had nearly cost him his life several thousand feet up in the air, even he had to admit there was a certain level of charm to this almost suicidal act he didn&#39;t know he had wanted.

Maybe he really was messed up in the head.

A puff of smoke had him relaxing even more into his seat. &#39;Kid?&#39; He raised an eyebrow, not even the least bit apologetic at being caught doing naughty kid things. &#39;Not going to impose curfew on us, are you?&#39;

His drink had been served at some point, but it was promptly ignored, as he indulged himself in this little game with the punk woman.

At Ann&#39;s behest, he lowered his voice conspiratorially, before raising his hand.

&#39;I don&#39;t usually talk about this,&#39; he beckoned the woman to literally lend her ear, &#39;since the Grail is a wish granter that can fulfill any kind of wish, no matter how deranged they may be. The truth is, and I don&#39;t say this lightly...&#39; His voice dropped to an almost whisper.

<strong>&#39;I don&#39;t want it.&#39;</strong>

He tucked a strand of hair behind Ann&#39;s ear, before pulling away with a mischievous grin. &#39;I don&#39;t need it. Got no use for it. I&#39;ve already had my wish granted the moment I summoned my Servant, and he took care of my problems for me. All that&#39;s left to do is to <em>win</em> this stupid thing. The Grail? I&#39;ll toss it into the Nile if I feel like it.&#39;

Preposterous. Was Lachlan bluffing? Though his eyes were quite serious. If he was lying, then he was doing an incredible job of it.

&#39;By all means, I should be kicked out of the War for wasting a slot,&#39; he sounded rather delighted as he pulled his own drink closer, which, upon closer inspection, turned out to be an ice cream float of all things. &#39;But what&#39;s gonna make me budge?

Eagerly, she complied, feeling a slight rush of anticipation as she leaned closer and his breath brushed against her ear.

But then her eyes widened a fraction, a mixture of shock and confusion crossing her face as he spilled the beans. She barely noticed as he tucked her unruly strands behind her ear, her features contorting in a combination of disbelief and... amusement.

&quot;You don&#39;t want it?&quot; She said, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips. &quot;I mean... they don&#39;t call it the Holy Grail War for nothing, the whole point is that we&#39;re fighting a <em>war</em> for the <em>Holy Grail</em>. What do you mean, you don&#39;t want it!&quot;

She didn&#39;t want to believe it at first, but she slowly realised that under the effects of her Mystic Eyes, Lachlan wouldn’t <em>care</em> to lie in the first place. He was perfectly serious about possibly throwing away an all-powerful wish-granting device after risking his life to grab it.

&quot;Pfttt... bahahaha!!!&quot; The combination of the alcohol in her blood and the unexpectedness of the moment completely <em>broke her</em>, sending the punk into a fit of laughter that echoed endlessly, filling the tense and quiet bar with her infectious if slightly unhinged amusement. She had to hold on to Lachlan&#39;s shoulder and the bar to keep from losing her balance over her stool, tears welling in her eyes from this laughter that had no right to be so intense or prolonged.

I&#39;ve had so many Magi lecturing me about my wish, saying that the other contestants would destroy me because of their important wishes... and yet here you are, one of the finalists, and you don&#39;t even want the damn thing! Fuck, that is some twisted comedy!&quot;

Her laughter died down, the woman breathless but satisfied, taking off her arm from him. She settled down, leaning against the counter, looking straight ahead as her features finally relaxed back to normal.

&quot;If anyone&#39;s going to make you budge, it won&#39;t be me. I don&#39;t give a damn what you do or why you do it.&quot; She paused for a moment to gather her thoughts before continuing. &quot;You have your reasons, however stupid they may be. If you&#39;re serious about them, no one&#39;s got the right to tell you otherwise. And if it&#39;s not the Grail you&#39;re after... then it obviously has to do with the war itself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was fine when he made light of his own ambitions. <em>Less</em> fine when someone did it on his behalf. Ann&#39;s laughter, filled with such vigor that it seemed like she was choking on it, made it difficult to discern whether it was intended as an insult or...well, another insult, given how little they saw eye to eye.

He briefly considered throwing the woman off her chair. Almost did it too, as he gripped her by the wrist when she fell onto his shoulders in another fit of laughter. <em>We&#39;ll see how much you enjoy a kiss with the grimy floor, woman...</em>

However, any harsh words he had been about to unleash was abruptly halted, as Ann turned what he had perceived as an insult into solid approval.

The unexpectedness of her response startled him. He was almost shocked out of his skin, and he surprised himself even more as he felt the muscles on his own face contort into a grin, as he tried to remember when he&#39;d last received a hug from another adult. Bill, perhaps, technically, when he had hauled Lachlan&#39;s sorry ass out of the graveyard? But from another woman—never, not since his mother had grew distant all those years ago.

Not that this could be classified as anything remotely close to a hug, of course. Ann was only using him for support. But it still provided a small measure of comfort against the world, where the constant need to put on a fa&#231;ade trumped every other need. To be treated with such...equality by someone who lived outside his usual circles was a refreshing experience. It made him want to confide in her more.

And that was probably going to be a terrible mistake.

&#39;I just want to win,&#39; he confessed, breaking the momentary silence between them. &#39;Until I do that, I&#39;ll never truly feel comfortable in my own skin.&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s the only thing that keeps me going.&#39;

&#39;Here&#39;s a thought. Why don&#39;t you buy the Grail off my hands?&#39; He made a preposterous offer to the woman. &#39;Wishing the sequel of some cult classic into existence is just as stupid.

He didn&#39;t care about the prize, simply because it was never about the prize in the first place. Lachlan wanted, <em>craved</em> to win the war. It was the only thing that kept him going. <em>The only thing that kept him going</em>.

The words acted like a key, opening the door to a painful time in Ann&#39;s mind. A time of suffering and self-doubt. A time when she fought alone against the world. A time when the very act of living felt like walking naked through a field of thorny vines.

A time when the only thing that kept her going... was a film about a kid taking a day off.

&quot;So that&#39;s your Ferris Bueller.&quot; Her features softened briefly as she looked at him, revealing a glimpse of the vulnerable person she once was. &quot;It&#39;s not stupid. It&#39;s your way of dealing with life. The light at the end of the shit tunnel you&#39;re walking through right now. It&#39;s not stupid, man... it&#39;s not stupid!&quot;

She pounded the counter with her fist, as if to physically hammer her words into the wood. Her head hung low as she thought back to the alley that old daddy Magus had brought up a week ago. The weight of that old scar threatened to break her tough exterior... but with a determined shake of her head, she shook off those emotions and quickly returned to her tough persona, smiling suspiciously at Lachlan&#39;s sudden proposal.

&quot;You&#39;ll satisfy my love for fictional men after all? Even though I almost killed you in that plane?&quot; She leaned forward and spat the cigarette butt between her lips into her empty drink, turning to face the man with an expression that was none too impressed. &quot;This deal sounds too good to be true... there&#39;s gotta be a catch.

Of course, bankrupting someone wouldn&#39;t give him the same satisfaction of physically crushing someone into fine paste. Did he truly move on already, forgiving and forgetting the atrocities Ann and her draconic Servant had caused on the plane? Was he really ready to move on from that, and were they really on the level of smoking buddies already?

The last time someone had invaded his personal space without invitation, he had made sure to pay it back tenfold. That very person now lay dismembered in several freezer bags in the Dowling mansion&#39;s basement.

So what made Ann so different?

Was it the fact that she laughed, not at his expenses, but for him? The fact that she seemed to take everything in stride, unflinching and unjudging, unlike before. The fact that she actually sounded like she had <em>acknowledged</em> him. He had barely mentioned a word about the Holy Grail War to his father before receiving a look across the dining table as if he were already a corpse. Meanwhile, Roland...

Roland was merely a lap dog, bound by trepidation, trapped by ineptitude, and crushed by pressure from his own family.

&#39;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still have to pay you back for ruining my perfect first day on Berenice&#39;s soil. But business is business. I&#39;d rather have someone like you make the world&#39;s most mundane wish upon the Grail, than let it fall into the hands of some Clock Tower dropout. If all it takes to shatter the dreams of Magi across the globe is for you to wish your fictional crush into reality, then that&#39;s a win in my book.&#39;

Lachlan stirred his drink as a pleasure-turned-smirk plastered itself on his face. He watched as Ann leaned in closer, and responded with a look of smugness.. &#39;<em>You</em> are the catch,&#39; he told the woman. &#39;But only if you can pay up.&#39;

Humans like you, they <em>are</em> worth a small fortune each in my father&#39;s eyes.&#39;

Lachlan continued to appraise Ann&#39;s body, as if he wore a pair of x-gray goggles. Having supervised enough shipments of &quot;human resources&quot; to the Dowling mansion, he had become proficient enough at distinguishing between mere fodder and a body strong enough to work as the base of a standalone Skinwalker unit. 

Ann definitely fell into the latter category. 

&#39;You&#39;d fetch a pretty hefty sum. The Dancer&#39;s body originally came from that of a balleri—&#39;

He blinked, caught off guard by Ann&#39;s final remark. &#39;Perv?&#39; He stammered, then frowned. &#39;There&#39;s nothing pervy about it. It&#39;s all part of the procedure. Do you look at a defeathered chicken at the butcher&#39;s and think yourself pervy?&#39;

Alas, he seemed to be digging quite an impressive hole for himself...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1131583374989996042 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1131583374989996042><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 20, 2023 8:48 AM">8:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even by Magi standards, Lachlan was very… odd. A little difficult to read, a little unpredictable, infinitely conceited yet aware of the foolishness of his goal. He was unlike any other Magi Ann had ever met. And the more words they exchanged, the more she realised just how hilariously weird and refreshingly unique he was.

Not to say anything about his motivations, or his apparent obsession with screwing over other Magi by giving away the Grail to a commoner (which she found hilarious), but even the way he looked at her was odd. It felt less like someone checking her out at a bar, and more like the clinical examination of a surgeon. Or more accurately… the detached gaze of a mortician looking at a corpse for the umpteenth time. 

Perhaps it was this unapologetic unhingedness, this dancing on the fringes of normality, that drew her in in the first place. He was to the Magi what she was to the humans: an outsider.

“Brrr… stop looking at me like that, it’s creepy.” She said as she subtly turned her back to the man, the punk uncharacteristically rubbing her shoulders in discomfort. “I can’t even remember the last time someone made me feel unconscious about my body, fucking hell.”

“If a butcher looked at a chicken the way you looked at me, you bet your ass I’d think he was a pervert!” She stood her ground, pointing her index finger at Lachlan, poking him assertively as she talked back. “Or a huge creep, I guess that works too. And what’s this about ‘fetching a hefty sum’? You run a prostitution ring or something? Man, forget what I said earlier about paying with my body, I take it all back. You’re no fun to tease.”

“And besides, time’s up.” She declared as she pointed to the clock behind them with her thumb, smiling unapologetically. “You know where to find me once you win that Grail, err... redhead?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was all written in Ann&#39;s features, the way she looked at him as if he was some kind of alien that didn&#39;t know the first thing about human etiquette. Or worse, pick-up lines. 

The Dowling heir buried his face in his hand and rubbed his forehead. 

&#39;...I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&#39; he protested with a grumble. &#39;That was meant to be a compliment. I don&#39;t know why it came out that way. Force of habit?&#39; He suggested unhelpfully, perhaps adding even more strikes to his already spotty resume.

Tact didn&#39;t seem to be on his side today, he surmised. With a scowl, Lachlan turned his attention back to his smoke, taking a long drag to calm his nerves. &#39;Let&#39;s just say that my family runs a butcher shop of their own, though I wouldn&#39;t advise you to get in touch with them unless you&#39;re truly desperate.&#39;

&#39;The name&#39;s Lachlan, anyway.&#39; He added, a look of amusement crawling back onto his face as Ann accepted his proposal. He gestured towards Roland, who retrieved a card from his pocket, which the puppeteer snatched. It was an innocent-looking, and rather plain business card, with <em>Dowling Marionettes &amp; Props</em> embossed in gold. The name on the card told Ann that she was looking at the next in line to manage the family business.

&#39;Don&#39;t suppose I get a name back?&#39; He held out the business card to Ann in place of a handshake, all the while playfully blowing some smoke her way.

&quot;Barring in exceptional circumstances, like when you make me relive my traumatic past using some bullshit illusion magic... I usually trade names with people I&#39;ve smoked with.

&quot;Now shoo, get out of here.&quot; She pocketed the card, then waved goodbye to the puppeteer and his assistant in a very dismissive manner, her gesture laced with hints of sarcasm and genuine resentment. &quot;I can&#39;t stand looking at your creepy, ugly face anymore, Lachlan.

Besides, the woman had already lost. Let her gloat while she could, the puppeteer persuaded himself. He <em>tried</em> to, at any rate...

&#39;It&#39;d be a shame if this bar trip of yours ended up turning into one such traumatic past,&#39; he responded swiftly, barbed words at the ready out of pure reflex. &#39;I know just the guy to ask for the experience, provided that he didn&#39;t die already, god bless his stupid beard.&#39; He spat venom at the memory.

...nope. Couldn&#39;t back down even if he wanted. 

&#39;At least allow me the luxury of my drink.&#39; He brought the smoke to his lips again, the actual drink in question completely ignored, even as the ice cream had melted halfway through.

But just as the punk let her guard down, she was reminded why she couldn&#39;t stand this guy in the first place. Her smile faltered for a second, becoming forced and fake as the puppeteer stayed in his chair and <em>purposely</em> dragged out his exit, not without annoying her, and damned if he wasn&#39;t good at annoying her.

&quot;You&#39;re pushing your luck, Dowling...&quot; She warned him through clenched teeth, her blood boiling. &quot;Ten minutes of me isn&#39;t enough for you? Want more Ann for your night? Fine, have it your way!&quot;

Fuming with frustration, she grabbed one of the empty glasses on the bar and shoved it in the bartender&#39;s face, not breaking eye contact with the smug red hair. &quot;Fill that shit up, bartender.

Lachlan took his time exhaling.

&#39;Bravo, mister, you&#39;ve successfully to ruined the mood.&#39; he said with a touch of sarcasm, before squashing the burning cigarette against the counter, narrowly missing the bartender&#39;s sleeve by a few centimeters. &#39;It&#39;s impressive, really, that you&#39;re a regular in a place where the bartender can&#39;t manage to keep his mouth shut.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He might as well be too, because now, not only was the bartender openly gawking, but the other customers had also abandoned any semblance of subtlety, and begun to stare openly at the dynamic duo.

Roland was no stranger to diffusing certain...unwelcoming attention. However, such feat required cooperation from the individuals who courted attention as enthusiastically as blooming flowers attracted bees.

&#39;Just let it go, Lachy.&#39; He said hesitantly to Lachlan. &#39;It&#39;s not like we came here for drinks anyway. What&#39;s gotten into you?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;You&#39;re right,&#39; he responded with a rude smile. &#39;We didn&#39;t come here for drink. Which means this fine establishment might as well not exist, right?&#39;

An empty threat, perhaps? Lachlan didn&#39;t exactly exude the aura of someone who could physically demolish a building. Unless...?

The puppeteer rose from his seat. He snatched his coat and stormed towards the front door—

Only to double back to the counter and squeeze Ann&#39;s cheeks between his fingers.

&#39;On second thought, you <em>would</em> make for a splendid specimen for my Skinwalker. I might reconsider, after this is all over.&#39;

He draped his coat over his shoulders and began to wade through the crowd towards the exit, this time in earnest...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140039481643249775 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140039481643249775><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 4:49 PM">4:49 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I swear... why are all Magi either assholes, crazy, or both? Any ideas, gramps?&quot; She asked the bar owner as she leaned against the counter, still processing this strange encounter in her mind.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why did everyone have to be such fucking assholes tonight, she mused quietly.

Without breaking eye contact, she quickly grabbed a random bottle of drink from the bar, took a swig and gave the barman a cheeky middle-finger salute. With her free-hand, she snatched her gig bag from under her seat, then headed for the exit.

&quot;Out of my way, limp dicks.&quot; She groaned, pushing her way through the gawking crowd as she left in the opposite direction to Lachlan, through the back exit.

As unsettling as it was, Ann had a feeling things could have taken a much darker turn, given the animosity between her and Lachlan. She should have been grateful that they only got a stern lecture from the bar owner, but still, what a lame way to end the night.

Oh well. It&#39;s not like she was going to meet Lachlan any time soon anyway.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, August 18, 2023 7:01 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
