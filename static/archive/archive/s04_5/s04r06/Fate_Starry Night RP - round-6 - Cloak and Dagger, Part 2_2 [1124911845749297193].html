While her goals hadn&#39;t changed she could see how the war had slowly began to turn more and more chaotic. Not to say that she had nothing to do with it, her encounters with both the other Sabers and Lachlan had left quite the impression on the city. Sure not as bad as others but that was mostly luck on the terrain than it being due to her own diligence. 

She had tried to hide it but she had not been able to ignore it once she realize it. During combat with all the different things happening it was easy for her to not bother with such details but once the battle was over it was a different story. 

Which was why she had taken her search for the mysterious killers a bit more personal. Part of her wanted all this chaos to end as soon as possible. After recovering from the wounds she recieved from Lachlan she and Saber had been hunting. They had dealt with some pairs in the last few days, some in a lethal way some ran away when losing their servant. Still it was hard to tell if that had actually helped or just add more oil to the fire.

She pulled a picture from inside her coat, normally she wouldn&#39;t do this with anyone around but she had gotten quite used to Saber and the servant hadn&#39;t asked about it either. She didn&#39;t doubt he could sneak a peek if he wanted so she was quite thankful for that.

She let out a sigh and put the picture away, tonight just like many other they continue to move using the leads the had recieved using Gloria&#39;s contacts in the police. As they moved though the alleys outside of the regular people eyes. She heard it, a violent scream and screech she was quite used to hearing. The sound of panic and fear. 

It was so sudden she had no idea what to make out of the commotion she was hearing. 

&quot;Let move Saber&quot; she said as she began towards where the commotion seems to originate.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber felt disappointed, frustrated even, by his performance in their last major interaction with a Master Servant pair, how could he be so careless… no, lacking. Is he really lacking? Or is there something that he is missing? He feels as if he knows what he missed, a new mindset may be just the fix. The thing is, he’s been repeating that thought process since the start.

That’s enough self loathing, all that matters is the decisions he makes now; the decisions in response to the situation in front of him. It won’t be the same as last time… for real this time. With that in mind, Saber is only eager to go on another adventure with Gloria even though he had just recovered from the injuries he had received previously.

?

Saber noticed that Gloria pulled something out her coat only to place it back before he could get a good look at it. Must be something really important if she had to take a look at it now. Perhaps they can talk about it later, because it seems that something big is happening… right now.

!!!

You’d think the people of this city would be more perceptive to that but perhaps they are all heavy sleepers or a bunch of cravens. Who knows how many victims of all these murders screamed at the top of their lungs until their lungs gave out. If the people were more perceptive, the murders would reach the masses and then the Church would have to do something as soon as possible. Whatever, they must all be under some kind of “must’ve been the wind” spell or something.

In response to Gloria’s order, Saber started to speed up towards the source with his sword already in his hand. Better be ready for everything, like, for real this time. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The chaos was such as that even when people were screaming next to her as she tried to advance against the current made out of bodies which run in utter fear, she couldn&#39;t fully understand what they were saying. 

Dread, the more she tried to advance slowly squeezing herself though anyone in front of her that was all she could feel. Mind you, she still had no idea of what was happening nor what was making this people run away with such fervor. Yet she could make an educated guess, it wasn&#39;t hard  after all she and Saber had been looking high and low for what could easily be the cause of this chaos.

No, coming to the conclusion was not the hard part, the hard part was accepting it. Accepting  that despite they trying to stop this it hadn&#39;t been enough. So even now she wished to be wrong that something else had happened. 

The sounds of battle could be heard the move the move through the horde of people, 

&#39;What were they thinking?&#39; was the first though which came to Gloria&#39;s mind. If her guess was right, the situation was slowly evolving into something beyond just a threat to this people which was already quite a pain if you asked her but it could lead to such horrible consequences that she rather not think about it. 

&lt;Saber move ahead!!&gt; she order him through their mental link. Despite her efforts it was not easy to go agasint the current specially if such current was people pushing her. In moments like this her frame which make her easy to slip in between people became an annoyance as she tried to move forward. 

But Saber had no such issues.

&lt;Tell me what you see, we need to get to the bottom of this&gt;

She struggle and crawl past the last row of people and as she saw the battle on pure instict she pulled her guns even when she didn&#39;t knew who to fire at just as one of them yell

It’s obvious that something just isn’t right, whatever this is could only have been done by a magus or a Servant. Since it is still there, the source of this happening may still be present as well as those who were unfortunate enough to be inside when it was formed. 

Are the locals actually this oblivious to what’s going around them? It’s a hospital that could have people they loved inside. Ultimately, the wellbeing of the people not part of the ritual is not a great concern as the tools required for completion are just the Servants and their Masters. But even so, it’s just not right to leave the building as it is.

 ”Master, there’s a—”

Saber turned to see Gloria with her guns at the ready. Wanting to think things out first, he holds Gloria’s guns down a little to get her attention.

 ”Master, it’s just nothing. Though we should consider our options before we do something about it.”

If the people responsible are still in the area, it would be unwise to give away their position right now. While they’re still busy, it’s good to think of an approach for an advantageous interaction.

 ”The people behind this may still be present, you think we should confront them right now or wait to see what happens if we don’t?”

Assuming they are indeed still around, confronting them right now seems like the most natural approach. What is going on in there? Is there a massacre happening? A fight perhaps? ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127347718180839645 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127347718180839645><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 8, 2023 4:17 PM">4:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Based on what he has heard, an Assassin is present and it seems that someone is in a pickle as well.

On the other hand, waiting for it to all blow over means they’ll be dealing with either a tired opponent or one that is just done doing some menial task. Either they start with an advantage or they start a ‘fair’ fight. Sounds like the former option has better odds in their favor but this one can either be really good or really bad.

Yet the past few weeks had been nothing but normal, even for someone used to conflict the multiple fights had taken a bit of a toll on Gloria&#39;s mind. It wasn&#39;t the constant fight but the sheer intensity of each one which kept hitting her right at it was over not giving her much time to rest. She still kept a tough front as regardless she knew she couldn&#39;t afford to lower her guard. Still Saber hand over her guns make her regain her composture. 

She decided to focus on the present for now in order to endure her mental fatigue, concerns and tiredness. But just before all went back to options, still right now their options were limited as regardless of they jumping or waiting the risk was still there. 

The building in front of them was as ominous as it could be, her instict was telling her to get far away from it. But at the same time it did fit with what something that could be associated with a murderer. Darkness and evilness surrounded the building like a black miasma which threaten to suck and erase all it touches. 

Entering was risky but waiting also led to the opportunity of the user to just escape and leave them without any information. 

&quot;Stick as close to me as you can and lets go in quietly&quot; it was a gamble she was well aware but seeing as there was a third party involved just waiting could prove to be most devastating the situation as with how chaotic the situation was it could always get worse.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127495192509956178 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127495192509956178><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 9, 2023 2:03 AM">2:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>They knew too little to just stay away and wait.

&quot;We are gonna try and figure out more of the situation. Depending of what we find we will act, but right now we need more information&quot; the initial panic was beginning to go away as her usual mindset begin to take over. Still that didn&#39;t meant that Gloria was okay, the issues still persisted and would definately become an issue in the future but for now she would be able deal with the situation. Or at the very least she hoped so.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

When was the last time Saber ever tried sneaking into a place that he knows has some bad guys in it? Saber is no ninja but he does have a little experience when it comes to stealth. Only a little as the rest was just a little deception, what a memory that was.

Saber nodded and began to approach the entrance of the hospital. A thought comes up in Saber’s mind regarding the smog that fills the building. Wondering how real it is and if they’d asphyxiate if they were to stay in there for too long.

 ”Master, think we’ll die from the air? It looks really dirty.”

Stopping a bit before the entrance, Saber scanned the exterior from the top to the bottom. Checking the windows, he can’t even check what is inside due to whatever is going on in there. Stepping away, he looks behind him to take a real good look at the city, just in case he ever forgets what the outside looked like.

Inhale, exhale. Saber took a deep breath before extending his arms out into the smoky mist. He begins his entry, sinking into the unknown as he does so. The air must be really thick and heavy if it managed to make his arm “disappear” as soon as it went in, but if it can go in then so can they… though is it really a good idea? It was not long before Saber disappeared as a whole.

 ”In we go…” ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The next room was a long one, with only a set of doors in the middle.

Most importantly, there were a set of swinging bladed pendulums along the length of it, swinging by with enough force to blow about the flaps of Triboulet&#39;s hat - one was there mere inches out from their own door.  Surely, she&#39;d be able to get past these, disable them somehow...but James?  That would be another story.

Slightly less importantly, there were two others at the other end: an exotic-looking, serious woman, and a much younger-looking...girl?  Boy?  Uncertain, and surely Triboulet would have some gag about that in the future.

From the perspective of Saber and his Master, it was hard to understand: one moment they were walking inside, and the next, after a veil of fog covered their vision, they were standing elsewhere completely.  A dingy room with a deadly trap in the middle, occupied by an old man and a tiny jester-looking woman.

This is quite inexplicable, so ultimately, any confusion they would have would be quite well understood.

The same goes for Triboulet, because she decided to open negotiations by slowly raising one of those narrow darts...and then throwing it at the head of Ms. Ignis.

After a pause to size it up, to gauge the distance, and to chuck it in the narrow moment where it wouldn&#39;t be hit by the intervening pendulums.

She at least had the kindness to say &quot;Catch this!&quot;, so maybe this was just a secret test of capability?  Character?  Who knows with her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They entered a hospital only to discover that, inside, it’s more like an old-fashioned mansion you’d see from rich western folk from, like, the olden days. This must be some kind of Bounded Field, a Reality Marble perhaps. Whatever, all there is to do is just to eliminate the source and it will all go back to normal. Just need to find it…

Across Gloria and Saber lies a mean looking contraption placed like an obstacle course. It’s like those dungeons in some fantasy novels, perhaps they’d find a tripwire connected to a bunch of dart traps laced with venom around here. That isn’t the only thing present however, there’s two people across from them too. They look like they’ve just gotten out of a messy situation, could they be the ones responsible for this? Or just some circus folk that got lost and found themselves here?

Well, Saber didn’t need to think that far as the silly looking one of the two tossed a dart headed straight between Gloria’s eyes. In the blink of an eye, the dart was caught between Saber’s fingers. Unlike a bullet, this one is pretty easy to see and intercept… especially easy as Gloria is right next to him. Twirling it in his fingers, he quickly aims in their general direction and, with a flick of the wrist, shoots it right back at them.

 ”Return to sender!”

A witty response to a cheeky announcement. Wonder what’s their problem? They just got here and were greeted with a dart, not by a dart trap, but by a dart creature dressed in the garments of a court jester. Not wanting to take a chance, Saber brandishes his blade, preparing himself for when things get personal. Seems like looking for trouble does, in fact, invite trouble.

 ”Perhaps you’d like to explain yourself before I skin you for leather? Maybe I’ll consider giving you a round of applause before I do so. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They understand some of the phenomenoms as while the really had no interest in it their main encounters with runaway mages give them some insight of it as they needed information in order to deal with any more enemies of the same nature as swiftly as possible.

But it was just general knowledge as even if you encounter something and gain some basic knowledge about that doesnt mean you understand it and can explain how it happened. In that regard Gloria had a bit more knowledge compared to some other members of her clan due to her recent journey where she travel all across the world. But as soon as she step inside of the building she had no idea what was happening. 

By all logic they should be right on the entrance of the building, but for some reason they werent. The insides of the building were also abnormal, full of traps and with a smell of death which was enough to make her sick but she kept herself together. 

Still even when she was ignorant of the details Gloria tried to make sense of the situation. She was in so deep though she didnt notice the projectile coming at her till Saber move to grab it. It was then that she turned and saw the other pair. 

She recognize them, before the building appear she saw them for a moment. Question was, were they the user or the target? She could deduce that they were the latter as if they were the use they wouldn&#39;t show up so easily? 

Were they trying to goat them? It was hard to tell, sure there were easier and more sneakier ways to deal with them if they truly wanted to get rid of them? 

&quot;You got our attention now, Im gonna assume that just like us are trapped in this building by its user? Care to share some information?&quot; Her tone was calm but was already considering how to deal with them in the worse case.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her knife sprung out from her hands and was held at an angle, which intercepted and deflected the dart.  It shot straight up, actually puncturing through the floppy bit on her archaic hat, and then hit the ceiling

Triboulet flourished her blade with a little twirl as she tapped her foot, setting it all jingle-jangle.  &quot;My position should be obv--&quot;

The dart dropped out of the ceiling and harmlessly tapped Triboulet on the head.  She paused, sighed, and continued as if nothing happened.

&quot;My position should be obvious,&quot; Triboulet called over the roar of the insidious machinery.  &quot;I cannot be dethroned from my seat as the smallest, weakest Servant of the war!  One look at you, and I&#39;m clearly being threatened...&quot;

Another narrow dart was held up, with clear intent to throw.  It was clear that she wouldn&#39;t get by with simply ranged offense, but a second shot following it up immediately - that might get past the androgynous fellow&#39;s defenses...

Triboulet paused.  Her pernicious smile drooped.  Was this going to get them anywhere, a fight in the middle of an obnoxiously loud murder machine?  At the very least, they could spare each other some words before a fight, surely...

&quot;Information?  The man we&#39;re looking for is an unpleasant fellow, whose moustache is stained with the blood of all sorts of random peasants she just killed.  A strange one.&quot;  She leaned forward, crossing her arms as the pendulum was now so close she could feel the cold of the metal passing by her nose.

&quot;Queer, isn&#39;t it, that you simply stumbled upon this place at the <em>exact</em> same time we did.  Call me a fool, James,&quot; she looked at the man to her side, &quot;but wouldn&#39;t you imagine that someone who was already here could be in league with that murderous idiot?

The other pair identity was certainly suspicious, their accusations being just a way to trick them away from the fact they were the user and have them lower their guard. But going with that line of though was risky as if they werent the enemy they would be tiring their forces and giving the true enemy as opening. 

They were is quite stalemate as neither couldn&#39;t prove that they weren&#39;t the user of this weird building.At least not right now. 

&quot;If we wanted you dead we wouldn&#39;t be just talking&quot; she went and reply to the Assasin as if  it was the most normal thing to do. &quot;I honestly dont care much about you two, we came here following the trail of a killer if you are that killer that makes things simpler if you aren&#39;t then we have no business with you. 

&lt;Saber keep an eye around in case there is someone else waiting for their chance&gt;

As she gave Saber that command she wonder if the moustache fellow she mention was the one who conjured this building. By description alone he fit the description of a killer but the weird dressed woman could be easily be lying.

She&#39;s right. They could have easily been waiting in here to deal with whoever the other Servant pulled in to finish them off. It was clever, after all. First pair softens them up for these two to finish the job. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if that&#39;s how a lot of the Masters met their fate. 

&quot;It does seem a bit too convenient.&quot; The older man replied back to his Servant while he kept an eye on the two in front of him. His gaze was mainly focused on the mid-section of their bodies, though. With how the air burned his lungs, the last thing he wanted to do was to fall asleep through accidental activation of his Mystic Eyes. However, his gaze <em>could</em> be taken the wrong way given Gloria&#39;s... <em>assets</em>.

Thankfully, they had other things to focus on than that! <s>Right?</s>

&quot;Look, we have been hunting this pair for awhile now.&quot; They haven&#39;t. &quot;We just finally managed to corner them here.&quot; It was just a chance encounter. &quot;If you are truly after this pair like we are, then what say you about an alliance?&quot; Even with the talks of peace, James haven&#39;t lowered either Silver Nail in his hand. Mister Fluffybuns kept a eye down the hallway behind them. 

The tension was almost too much to breathe properly, without even adding into the fact that the poisonous air was still lingering about, but all of that was thrown out the window as the other Master in front of them started to shoot the walls. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; James was dumbfounded by her actions. None of it made sense to him. What were bullets going to do against this thing?! Maybe an alliance might be a bad idea if this is who he was teaming up with...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128837876201832490 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128837876201832490><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 12, 2023 6:58 PM">6:58 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A voice - dead and flat, yet honeyed all the while - would echo throughout the hall. While initially disembodied, the owner of the voice would make his appearance known not but moments later.

At merely arm’s reach behind James, a figure would emerge from nothingness, as if some sort of veil had been placed his very existence until now. 

The sudden appearance of a Servant would alert Saber and Assassin to the man’s location… yet the Masters would feel their senses overwhelmed by something else entirely.

Paralyzing fear. 

Two arms, a hat, and a notable lack of scars would alert the Assassin team to Holmes’s apparent healed status, yet there remained only a single saw in one hand. They’d have no idea of knowing, but they weren’t the only ones in the building. The strongest, perhaps… but the blood of a mage isn’t necessarily required for a Servant to have a good meal. 

While armed, his posture was less than battle-ready. Leaning up against a wall with arms crossed, he would take in the sight of the “building’s” interior before side-eyeing the Master across the hall.

“This land is a far cry from the Windy City, and the Holy Grail War is certainly no World’s Columbian Exposition… but it’ll have to do. That being said, why not go on a little tour?”

With a snap of his open hand’s fingers, a rope fitted with a slipknot would suddenly rocket out of the dark opposite the backs of the Saber team. Within seconds, it would make its way around Gloria’s neck, intent on dragging her down the hall and away from the two Assassins.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A mixture of his own wounds and the mana exhausted for the Hotel seemed to leave him breathless, propping himself up against what was formerly the walls of a hospital, a place for respite and recovery turned into a more sinister form. 

A slow, though nervous, chuckle would come from the young Magus, his heart racing from his <em>very</em> close brush with death and a hand unconsciously going to gauge the beating.  He surveyed the room around him for a moment, taking note of the surface level similarities to the Hotel which the two had made their base of operations mearly a day or so ago. 

He seemed to warily survey the small room for any other signs of life, being met with only himself-his servant noticably absent from the locale. They had escaped death for now, and with the Mana H.H had most certainly recovered from the greivious wounds the god had branded him with. The territorial advantage of the hotel would certainly make Assassin a near unrivalled threat...had they been in America perhaps he could have even taken the Rider or the strange Master head on? It didn&#39;t matter for now, as the faces of the two they had encountered before had yet to fade-the hunt was hardly over.

Wilt warily pushed himself off the wall, old wounds aching from the expenditure. His location would most certainly be broadcasted, if the Magus with the Assassin decided to survey the strange mazes of the Urban Castle. Staying on his feet, nimble, was something he had to do. He couldn&#39;t be applying excess stress upon his Servant.

Another Servant has appeared out of thin air, a dandy one though quite haughty. This ‘sophisticated’ devil, with his arms crossed, side-eyeing and all that, acting like he is captain, is basically asking for a broken nose.

As much of a distracting eyesore he is to look at, Saber remembers the description provided by the jester. Unpleasant, mustached, and strange, this is the guy alright though they were definitely being way too nice about him. Saber thinks of feeding the guy his own intestines and giving him a taste of his own waste once he’s done with him.

!!!

A sound of something being launched forces Saber to look behind him. A noose was shot out of nowhere and has Gloria by the neck, dragging her like a dog on a leash. That bastard, he’s really going to eat his innards after this.

Saber rushes to catch up with the rope dragging Gloria before she gets sent to the shadows. Sliding on the floor, he does a quick swipe with his sword, cutting the rope. Adjusting himself, he rushes to Gloria’s aide to cut the loop off her neck before picking her back up on her feet.

 ”Master, we need to get moving. Standing still looks to be a bad idea.”

Who knows how many of those tricks that devil has in his sleeve. That’s a real good reason to stay on the move lest it happens again, can’t get caught if they’re too fast to be caught. Saber makes sure Gloria gets her balance before positioning himself by her side, bracing for any follow up attacks from the enemy.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

James and her servant reaction would made them appear they werent the user, the expression on James was mostly confusion but it didnt seem like confusion at watching someone do something futile but more like just simple confusion. 

In all fairness that didn&#39;t prove anything, but it help her put some more trust on the new pair. But there was another reason why she seemingly wasted ammo. She knew nothing of this building, whenever it was magecraft nor a servant ability. If it was magecraft she could manage as even if she didn&#39;t understood the concept there were bound to be limits. On another side if this was a servant doing, the possibilities were endless. 

The building was tougher than normal, her bullet didn&#39;t pierce deep into the walls. She was still in the middle of her analysis when they were interrupted. A figure appeared, she could barely get a look before rope tighten itself around her neck and pulled her away. 

&quot;....!!!&quot; she couldn&#39;t even yell at Saber for help  but her servant move on his own and saved her. That sudden trap had been way to fast. With barely if not any chance for not only her but anyone to react. That make her believe the user of this building was probably a servant. 

That made things harder she needed to deal with the user but at the same time if Saber got to far away she was easy prey.

&quot;Right&quot; she said as she focus her flames near her legs as she pushes herself forward.

Really, even as she started to blast apart the walls, she assumed that this was some roundabout way past their defenses...

...but no, she really was just shooting the walls of a building.  She was spared the second needle out of confusion.

Even if she couldn&#39;t hear James&#39; thoughts like that, she turned to look at him and saw the look on his face, and she knew they had a similar view here.  &quot;To think she&#39;s been here but briefly and she&#39;s already gone mad...I didn&#39;t know the people of today were so soft.  What a few minutes in a dungeon would do to you...!&quot;

Speaking of madness, though!  Behind them, a much more familiar, certainly antagonistic face appeared - and just within reach of her Master.  Triboulet stood between the two instantly, for what good it did, one hand threatening with a knife and the other with a felt-tip head.  &quot;Our esteemed host...forgive me,&quot; she said to the reclining Assassin, &quot;but I&#39;m the sole soul allowed to make jests towards suicide here.  Quit copying my style.&quot;

When Mudgett&#39;s rope came to try and drag the other Master to her demise, Triboulet...at least had the good sense that it wasn&#39;t James.  She had an issue, though, in that they were within touching distance of James...and the traps of this room wouldn&#39;t give way so easily!  As the fight commenced anew, Triboulet tossed a knife - two knives, three knives, before finally getting one to go through the plaster of the ceiling and into the internal mechanisms that kept the nearest pendulum swinging.  It ground to a screeching halt, jerking to try and move but providing no further danger.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129832596256325783 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129832596256325783><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 12:51 PM">12:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was a costly endeavor with how few of these daggers she kept on her person, but it gave James just a bit more space to maneuver away.

His Servant had the same idea in her mind without even needing to use their telepathic link. Well, he expected to find some weird cases in this war after what he has seen so far.

That collective thought between them had little to not time to last any longer than it already has after the mustached man reappeared; this time behind him. 

&quot;Assassin!&quot; James took a leap back to get out of reach, hoping Triboulet would take his place, which she did before he could even begin to move. It looked like he needed to work on his response time. Though, can he really compare to a Servant? No. But there is always room for self-improvement!

The further he was away from the enemy servant, the better! So, he took another step to further himself and-

<em>click</em>

One step too far.

The sounds of rope rushing and being pulled was heard and then James&#39; world was turned upside down as he was suspended in the air by another trap. &quot;Gaah!&quot; A solid thud was heard while he was launched into the air. His vision was dazed for a second after having struck his head against the wall. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t enough to knock him out but he wasn&#39;t completely okay either. 

The pendulum that Triboulet stopped ended up being James&#39; saving grace, halting the axe that would have embedded itself into his chest. Now he had to deal with trying to get untied. The athletics needed to reach up to his ankle was asking for much more than his old body could do. Not that he could cut the rope if he could. Damn his Silver Nails and their lack of any cutting prowess!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1129901409748406322 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1129901409748406322><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 15, 2023 5:24 PM">5:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiderrock">@Spiderrock1712</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="isu1640">@smaller isu</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The reverberations of a solid impact would travel down Triboulet&#39;s aluminum baseball bat, and into her arms. Would it have been flesh that was impacted, a less painful recoil could have been expected. 

Alas, the walls of this place were plenty tough, and solid as brick.

Despite that, it would appear to all four of the serial killer&#39;s opponents that - following his leaning back into it - <em>fell through</em> that very same wall, disappearing just as fast as he had appeared to them. Along with him, so too would his magical energy signature seemingly evaporate, becoming one with that magical energy all around them.

&quot;Ha ha ha ha-! An alliance... how quaint.&quot;

A voice would echo throughout the hall, coming from nowhere and everywhere all at once. The very same voice of the mustachioed man they&#39;d seen moments ago.

&quot;Oh, my dear Assassin... do you truly believe you are the only one allowed to jest? That you - as a jester - are in sole ownership of gallows humor? If such a statement were to have been made but a minute ago, we would be in agreement on that, truly. However-&quot;

<strong>&quot;The moment the four of you stepped foot into this domain, every single aspect of your being became mine. Your humor. Your mind. Your body. Your <em>soul</em>. If Gehenna is what you are looking for, then allow me, Dr. Henry Howard Holmes, to show it to you. Welcome to Hell.&quot;</strong>

The end of the serial killer&#39;s rant would be punctuated by a second snapping of fingers heard from behind the Saber team. While no man could be seen standing there, the sudden brightening of the hallway and surge of heat would herald the conflagration heading towards them from the same direction.

As for H. H., he was needed elsewhere at the moment.

Stepping into one of the hotel innumerous rooms, he would brush off his newly rejuvenated sleeve.

&quot;It appears we have an unforeseen issue, Master. Assassin would have been no issue, I assure you. Yet, in spite of our gamble, it appears we must face a Saber as well. Come, Wilt.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But on the bright side the situation was not as bad as it could be, yes they were still on enemy territory but asshe continue to act and think she began to understand how the whole building worked even if at a really superficial level.

The traps were something akin to how the servant was able to attack them. She assumed that it he could do more and soon she would be proven right. As she shoot towards the blades hanging the beam break through their connection at the ceiling making them fall into the ground. 

This was interesting in the sense that it confirmed something from her. The amount of power needed to deal with this traps and even what would be needed to destroy the building if that was even an option. 

She stopped and turned as she felt heat on her back, really it was one thing after the other in this place. She assumed it was part of the user plan, try to keep  them from having any time to think and slowly chip at their strenght. 

&quot;Ignia!!&quot; she yelled as she punched forward with her fist, a white flame enveloped in cold air would come out and form a thick wall as she pulled back. She knew this wouldn&#39;t be enough buy should give them some time to think and get away. 

&quot;Need a hand?&quot; she said to James as she moved towards them jumping through remnants of the fallen blades.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With her target disappeared, Triboulet looked around for a moment - he could have simply disappeared into the mists - but found that she wasn&#39;t immediately being stabbed.  Still, for an ounce of protection, she made a classic baseball reference: &quot;Looks like I&#39;ve just struck out at Love and 15, then.&quot;

Then, some pleasant tauntery was thrown about.  Dr. Holmes, as he referred to himself, was a very ghoulish-sounding fellow with all these references to death and Hell - it really should be this clown&#39;s sole ownership over such topics, yes!  She called back to him, wherever he was: &quot;You were in Hell the moment you let me inside your house, you miserable host, you!  I shall break your plates and soil your rugs!  I&#39;ll upturn your chamber pots and chew with my mouth open!&quot;

James, of course, had some kind of comic pratfall of his own while she was focused on making Dr. Holmes regret his life.  Had she not stabbed right through the mechanism before him, they&#39;d be down half a man!  She hopped over and cut him loose swiftly, grabbing him - avoiding the tender areas which still had time to heal yet - and dropped to the ground with him in tow.

&quot;No, he needs no hand, my fair opponent,&quot; she replied to Gloria, &quot;for he&#39;s yet to lose either of his God-given own.  Perchance, he may lose one yet, so keep it in mind.&quot;

This barrier, conjured of magecraft, wouldn&#39;t hold long enough to give them peace of mind.  Triboulet asked the assembled group: &quot;What now?  Continue to stumble forward blindly?  That&#39;s what we&#39;ve done so far.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

…

What a joke.

If he’s going to play like a rat in the walls then he’ll be treated like one, and just like one he’s going to be flushed out and exterminated by any means necessary.

So, how does one go about doing that…? Hmm, if the traps can be tampered with, even disarmed, then is it possible to raze sections of the building to fine dust? There’s only one way to find out.

With raging fires creeping behind them, Saber makes his move and sprints forward. He sheathed his blade and readied his fists as he began to close in where he saw the man disappear. Wonder what’s on the other side, time to find out!

 ”I’m coming for you!”

He loudly announced. As he gets within distance of the wall, he halts his approach as he braces his body for a little impact. He twists his body and throws a meaty punch, busting a chunk off the brick wall. Retracting his fist, he delivers another. And another. And another. And another, another, another, another.

It was not long until the wall had a sizable hole in it.

 ”Master, let’s leave this room before we get cooked.”

Thinking about it, wouldn’t it be easier to go through the door where the other pair came from? Well, they have a more direct route to the enemy Servant right here… unless he really did become one with the walls. Patiently he waits for his Master before making an entry. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If he did, he wouldn&#39;t be able to look at anyone in the eyes in the afterlife.

Fortunately, a fiery entrance came his savior. Not the magus who summoned the flames, of course. That would be silly! Assassin freed him from further embarrassment... only to place him in her arms as if he were a damsel and she his hero. 

&quot;If I lost a hand, how ever will I applaud you for saving my ass again, Assassin?&quot; The attempt of a joke was made with such a deadpan expression that it fell right on the balance of being funny and being unfunny. A complete amateur at the art of comedy. If only they had the brains to practice their act together at the start then James would be able to help maintain her ace-in-the-hole a little better. 

He thought on how to answer his Servant&#39;s question until it was halted by the other Servant, presumably Saber if he had to guess, when they attempted to dismantle the hotel with their bare hands instead.

As Saber began to batter the walls, a whisper would pass him by. Nothing but a illegible, meek noise of unknown origin.

Soon enough, the hole he made had become human-sized, and, in escaping the oncoming inferno, the serial killer&#39;s four opponents leapt into the newly uncovered room on the other side. 

A room with no door, no windows... little more to look at than pipes upon pipes, backed by cracked, scratched-up wallpaper, all dotted with the occasional bloody trailing handprint.

It would take a second to notice, but the magical energy within the room was so potent that it was likely poisonous, disregarding the thicker stink of the noxious gas permeating what seemed to be the entire building. And, yet, the other choice was to be immediately burned alive.

They&#39;d be given to time to contemplate another option, as any train of though would be interrupted by a piercing screech not dissimilar to that made by a cheap intercom.

&quot;Victims of the castle are as lambs to the slaughter. Of that, I have no doubt. Unfortunately, my dear guests, I am afraid we are going to have to cut your stay short. Until then, I urge you-&quot;

The serial killer&#39;s voice would ring throughout the room just as it did the hallway, albeit with a slightly more notable echo. 

&quot;-rest well. I heard the trip to Hell was just as unpleasant a journey as mine was to London. At least the women were easier... to dissect, that is. Just as I will do to you!&quot;

It was a dramatic entrance for a wall-hugging Assassin such as himself, but there was no use hiding in this room. The worst possible room they could have entered.

Wasting no time, the man - bearing his saw in front of him as he had in his fight against Sri Kalki - would snap the fingers of his off-hand once more. It was time to end this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Simultaneously, the pipes on all sides of room barring those on the entry side would suddenly begin to groan, before bubbling up as if made of bubble wrap rather than metal.

In a sight one could only compare to that made by an abstract horror artist, those same bubbles would bubble again and again... until taking the shape of screaming, terrified faces, slowly twisting and stretching out in the direction of the Assassin and Saber pairs. Soon, the groaning of the pipes would be joined by the dreadful moaning of the dead and damned, a cacophony fit for a place such as Gehenna.

In having stretched the pipes out as far as they had, the faces would meet stronger, and stronger resistance, until finally being unable to move any further. A strange silence would overtake the room for a moment as the pipes stilled...

Only to burst a second later. The inhumanly stretched mouths of the faces in the pipes would be turn and forced open, acting as failure points for the metal pipes, releasing a thick, green gas that would quickly envelope the room.

Vision would be obscured, bordering on the opacity of the smog covering the building&#39;s entrances. Voices and all sounds would be muffled, mimicking the effects of being submerged, though any amount of noise would likely be drowned out by the screams of hundreds of souls. And, more importantly, the air would become entirely unbreathable, as if attempting to force cotton soaked in a potent acid into one&#39;s lungs.

It was H. H. Holmes&#39;s signature method of killing. Locking his victim(s) into a exit-less room, then filling it with poisonous gas. While strong enough throughout the labyrinthian Bounded Field to cause his mundane victims to expire, a killing room such as this one was perfect for taking on the Master-Servant pairs.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, July 22, 2023 12:23 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It&#39;s true that, once killed, the slain are rare to return.&quot;  She gave him a sardonic pat on the back.  &quot;Brilliance, dear James.  Our two compatriots fear thy tactical mind.&quot;

Her extreme backsassery was, eventually, rewarded.  She&#39;ll die someday for this crime.

Mudgett&#39;s return was hailed with another knife, held at its tip and ready to send to its resting place between his eyes.  To do so would be instantaneous, flawlessly executed - she was a poor excuse for a killer herself, but to toss knives, that was something expected of her in her mundane life.  It would be simple...

...and pointless.  Even if this wasn&#39;t someone fast enough to deflect it, he would sooner become one with the wall than let it hit him.  The futility of it all, internally, pissed her right off.

With the man having let out his endless air of threats, Triboulet had this in retort: &quot;Dissect me all you want!  You&#39;ll find a coal-black lump in my chest, a yawning chasm in my skull, and a set...of...&quot;

Her eyes were drawn from the all-too gleeful murderer&#39;s own, and towards the increasingly loud pipes of the walls.  She stood in front of James, shielding him partially, which only put her closer to the eventual almost-literal jumpscare.  Mudgett had the opportunity to feel some satisfaction - even this Servant, supposedly one of the world&#39;s finest, felt terror here - Triboulet reeled, threatening to push James off his feet with her recoil as the metallic faces leaped from the architecture.  Perhaps there was even less to this Assassin than he would be led to believe.  She had seen horrors, of course, but something this overtly supernatural, terrifying in its concept had passed her by.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132568148781043783 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132568148781043783><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 23, 2023 2:01 AM">2:01 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was almost a <em>relief</em> to see the metal burst apart, even if it probably would end with their deaths by asphyxiation.

A shouted burst of humor, &quot;The supply of hot gas from which you speak, Assassin!&quot; kept her alive, but it expelled vital air that would not be immediately replaced.  Triboulet doubled over, her throat immediately burning as it was pinched together in asphyxiation...she had to have something that&#39;d keep them from death, something!  No air to joke, no ability to pratfall with a body wracked in the tort of choking...

She drew her felt scepter, and changed its form once again.  The golden haft was formed and split apart, and it became a long fan right after.  Immediately, she did the first damn thing that came to mind: she would try spinning!  That&#39;s a good trick, yes?

Her body became the rotor of her fan blade, and with each rotation she seemed to exponentially grow faster - eventually reaching inhuman speeds and beyond, exerting herself tremendously as she spun in place and made a self-formed fan!  The gas about her started to be pushed away despite its continuing pouring, providing the quartet a narrow bubble of air to breathe safely in.

She said something but it was lost in all the wind noises.  Woosh.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she constantly though about the best approach over and over as that was her only hope to match many of her foes which were beyond her in many ways. After a while she had discover that logic as a whole had quite the limit, at least when it came to her. 

She had seen how the most sound plans had been broken and how people had managed to overturn almost impossible situations. In the world where magecraft and heroic spirits logic could only do so much. And so after her latest fight she had began to think outside the box in a realm outside of logic. 

They were in a impenetrable room, which was slowly being filled with gas which Gloria could only assume it was bound to do their worse towards them. This wasn&#39;t even a case of limited options, honestly speaking they had none. It was then that the clown lady managed to buy them some time but just like her own attempt before it was just a matter of time. 

At least if going through logic and common sense. Gloria focused all she had learned from this building and tried to make sense and use it in order to find a solution. There was no clear answer, the best she could come up was a gamble. But a choice between a gamble and death was no choice. 

&quot;Thank you Payaso&quot; she said as stood near Triboulet.  

She would bet all out their lives in a single possibility. Being able to break out of this room, break the whole building and take whoever was attacking them alongside it. But to even begin to try this crazy and reckless idea she needed a small opening. One which Triboulet had just given her. 

&quot;Hey you killer...&quot; she said as flames gather around her. &quot;...the more you speak the more I know I cant let you alive...&quot;

It didn’t matter to Saber if he was blinded with a dry throat, he’s going to have to level it all to the ground no matter what. But thanks to the efforts done by the other Servant and Gloria, it’s all too easy now. With a little clarity of sight and a sudden burst of power surging through his body, he readies himself to utterly wreck the whole thing like a one man demolition crew.

 ”Destroy this place, huh. Alright then, I’ll do just that!”

Saber busts his arm through the wall on his side, pulling a large chunk of it to hurl at the silhouette of the enemy Servant. Running up, he delivers an impactful donkey kick to add some extra force, making a hole on the other side of the room. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132838626741465138 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132838626741465138><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 23, 2023 7:56 PM">7:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For someone who’s only ever used his sword since he was summoned, it may seem that he is quite strong on his own… albeit he seems more of an animalistic brute like this, a Berserker even.

He repeats the process over and over and over again. Wrecking a section of the building while roughing up the enemy Servant as he does so. Saber wonders if he’s even still there. But it doesn’t matter if he’s blindly attacking a target that isn’t there, what matters is that he accomplishes his task, that is to ‘destroy this place’.

Minutes in the double digits have passed. The place is nothing but dust and debris, what was still standing eventually fell over, the ones that didn’t collapsed on themselves.

It is a wreck.

The Bounded Field dematerialized as the main structure was demolished. It’s over now, all there is left to do is to confirm the defeat of the enemy Servant and perhaps neutralize the former Master if needed.

 ”Come out, come out, wherever you are! Surrender yourself now and maybe, just, maybe I’ll behead you instead.”

Saber goes ahead to regroup with Gloria and the other pair. They should go search for them now lest they get away, it would be a major waste of effort if they let them go now.

Until his very last breath, apparently. A breath of fresh toxic gas the serial killer felt was duly needed was instead quickly swept away by the sudden current driven by Triboulet’s self-powered fan. 

“Damnable-!”

Wasting no time, the Saber team sprung to action. As soon as Gloria’s fire giant appeared, H. H. would leap backwards, bracing himself for a fall through the wall. 

Fiery impact after fiery impact would land yards, then feet, then inches away from him. The visual disturbance of the flames would provoke memories of the man being burned half to death by a divine avatar’s Noble Phantasm, resulting in a brief lapse of judgement… and his standing entirely still, staring blankly at the light of the fire.

Fear. 

&quot;Damned Rider... Damned <em><strong>Ruler</strong></em>!&quot;

Frozen, a chunk of brick would smash Holmes into the wall he was leaning against, knocking the air out of him and leaving him conscious only by the fact that he was a Servant. Just about as he was to fall to his knees (as any would when faced with such an inhuman amount of pain), a flying kick powered by a berserker-like rage would send the ailing Assassin through a freshly-made exit way. Knowing what would happen should he stay still, Assassin would throw himself backwards using the momentum of the kick, making space between him and Saber.

Just out of his attacker&#39;s range, H. H. would break into a sprint, running through a nearby wall… which would be just as quickly destroyed, forcing the killer out into the open once more.

Snap. A trio of chains would snake towards the Saber from behind… only to be torn out of the   ceiling and thrown in bolo-esc fashion towards Holmes before being slashed and shattered by his saw. 

Snap. Whirring circular saw blades would spring out of the walls, threatening to split Saber in twain… only for them to be immediately bent via kick, causing them to stick into themselves and abruptly stop.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, July 24, 2023 1:40 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A misstep that would force him into his own trap: A single, solitary noose, hanging there motionlessly, unlike those once used to attack the enemy Masters. Unfortunately for Saber, his view of Assassin would be obscured by the collapsing of the hallway&#39;s halls, cutting off his path to victory.

With Holmes’s Noble Phantasm dispelled, every <em>surviving</em> victim of the American psycho - Gloria, Saber, James, (the Garish) Assassin, and a single, solitary doctor, whose snoring made checking his pulse a worthless pursuit - would find themself standing just outside the entryway of a wholly collapsed hospital. No H. H. Holmes in sight.

Until Saber chose to turn around, that is. 

As a hospital, the collapsed building had required electricity, a utility that was delivered by a line of large wooden poles that had wire strung from one to the next. Despite the collapse of the hospital, the nearest one still stood, upon which the corpse of H. H. Holmes was hanged by a mess of thick black wires. 

The golden flakes dancing away from his body would signifying his defeat, and eventual disappearance from this world. For having caused the city of Berenice so much trouble, he&#39;d simply faded away- as if he’d never existed. Much like his victims.

Yet, there was no Master. The surviving group had not known it, but Holmes’s sudden departure mid-fight had been to lead Wilt to the labyrinth’s exit, after which he&#39;d been “convinced” to leave and never return. Not that it mattered more, anyhow. 

For the war was coming to a close.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Monday, July 24, 2023 1:48 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

...and as everything came back into audible range, her ears no longer pounding, she heard something else - the loud thump of her own heartbeat, louder than ever before.  Not even James&#39; near death at Lachlan&#39;s hands, nor being almost crushed into pieces by <s>her husband</s> the White Dragon had inspired this much exhalation from her.

Triboulet leaned forward, one hand on her knee and the other on her chest to bid herself to recollect further.  That fear was...short-lived, really.  She almost could&#39;ve sat back and watched Saber tear that hellhole into scraps, were it not for her need to keep James safe from its collapse.  A thrilling moment, followed by--thrilling?  No, no, that wasn&#39;t so.  Something else.

The real world at least had an answer to the question of &quot;Am I safe now?&quot; hanging above her head - quite literally.  As the fool turned upward, she noticed a pair of shoes dangling above her vision.  A body and a head, face twisted in sudden rigor by the exertion about its neck, made almost unrecognizable by the circumstances.

There was one thing that stuck out, though: that moustache.  An unmistakable, ugly thing.

Assassin, or Mr. Mudgett, had himself been murdered.

&quot;...You&#39;ve no need to call him out like a cat,&quot; she said to Saber, her voice still a little hoarse from the exertion.  &quot;He&#39;s right there.&quot;  

Her finger pointed upward to show him the fruits of his labor.  &quot;Seemed he died as he lived: like a bitch.&quot;  She pulled off her cap and placed it above her chest in a mock salute to him, presumably being the one soul to mourn his passing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133542251763597443 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133542251763597443><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 25, 2023 6:32 PM">6:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>An eye turned to the other two after her brief remembrance, uneasy: &quot;I trust that I&#39;ve no need to see other bitches out today, as well?  You&#39;ve narrowed down the competition a bit.  Kill me and James, Saber, and...you&#39;re just spoiling the fun for the end!&quot;

To be honest, Triboulet had little in her head that kept Saber from just annihilating her on the spot.  Maybe some light humor would convince him to hold it off.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
