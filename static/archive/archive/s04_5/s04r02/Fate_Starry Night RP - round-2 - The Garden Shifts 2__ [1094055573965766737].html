Boats were common, and small rivers dotted the island as a result. It was not uncommon for traders to offer seeds in older times as exchange for other goods. Those seeds were planted, grown, and harvested. When all was done, Benerice was a hotspot of vegetation.

This made Benerice&#39;s Town Park an absolute treat to visit when flowers were in bloom. Everything from sunflowers to hyacinths to roses dotted the path. It was a popular dating spot for old-fashioned couples.

Illyn was out of his depth, then. He hadn&#39;t been here for years. Nonetheless, there was a leyline situated in the park. It had been inspected by the Church&#39;s Overseer, and it was clear that they had been checked and discerned. Likely to determine if it was a worthy location to summon the Holy Grail.

For that reason, Illyn wanted it for himself. This was also a good place to bury dead bodies. Waste not, want not.

Additionally, his fireflies could flicker about unnoticed. In their own little way, they had become a small tourist attraction in this garden. 

&quot;<strong>ACHOO!</strong>&quot; Illyn sneezed. &quot;Sorry. Bless me.&quot; He responded to a couple. He continued walking down the cobblestone path. <em>I loathe pollen.</em> His voice echoed through Kalki&#39;s mind.

A crisp tan coat with a black scarf fluttered in the wind as Illyn took notice of the surroundings. He held a newspaper in his hand to maintain a sense of normalcy. Normally, he wouldn&#39;t dare go out into such a public place. The Holy Grail War had heightened this. Yet a change of outfit, a pair of sunglasses, and a haircut. These were enough to keep all but the most committed out of the way.

Hopefully it stayed that way.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094070481658851439 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094070481658851439><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 8:25 PM">8:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Fly.&quot; Illyn said. Dozens of fireflies lit up, and began to fly off in different directions. Illyn, meanwhile, took a seat and began to read his newspaper. Despite this, he kept looking around the garden through the corner of his eye.

The vegetation around him would very quickly and very noticeably begin to grow. The trees grew a little, the grass grew taller, the flowers bloomed faster and the seeds began to sprout. It was most certainly a supernatural occurrence. Upon a further inspection he would quickly be able to find the woman at the  centre of it. Who was casually touring the gawking at every new plant she found 

Alice as she described it was scouting Bernice. To an outsider thought her movements would most definitely be viewed as tourism. But she simply couldn&#39;t help herself. She had never been in a city like Bernice before she had hardly ever been to a city. She had been filled with excitement walking around unaccompanied. It was easy for her to get drunk on the wonder and novel of being able to make decisions for herself. She hardly paid any mind to her servant who was meant to be with her. Bernice was bursting with fertility and she had quickly found herself at the Town Park as if it had called to her. It had been a location listed as a good <s>tourist stop</s> scouting point for her to check out.

She was now crouching next to a plant she had only seen in books. Placing a hand on it the stalk grew wrapping around her arm causing her to giggle. The girl was completely lost in her own world.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why was he sneezing so much? It was impossible for him to develop allergies in such a short amount of time. It made no logical sense. He sniffed as he flicked over to the next page in the paper. What was a nine letter word for immature behavior? Childish? Eight. 

<em>Infantile.</em> The word was written down into the newspaper. The word tasted amusing in Illyn&#39;s mouth. Immaturity.  Something everyone could relate to, if they so chose. 

When Rider was summoned, Illyn&#39;s behavior had been infantile. He had wanted to order Kalki&#39;s death, despite the superb waste of resources. As a magus, it was shameful to be so wasteful. It spat in the face of equivalent exchange.

Something in the corner of Illyn&#39;s eyes caused him to drop his newspaper onto his lap with a satisfying <strong>flap!</strong> In a deft yet stiff motion, Illyn returned the newspaper to its original position as he stared at a young woman messing with flowers.

Using Magecraft. Unless flowers in Benerice grew a hundred times faster. <em>Kalki.</em> Illyn thought at his Servant, before reflecting the sight of Alice playing into his Servant&#39;s mind.

Kalki also had a rush of other emotions fill his mind from Illyn. <em>Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. Foolish. Stupid. Infantile.</em>

Illyn stood up. He pulled IBM out from his coat pocket. Publically using Magecraft warranted termination. If he could remove this woman with little fuss, he would. He looked around. No other people visible. He took a step towards, and began pondering what to project from IBM.

<strong>CRACK.</strong> A sound echoed out that both Alice and Illyn could hear. Illyn looked down at a broken twig. 

IBM quietly disappeared into Illyn&#39;s coat pocket as he began whistling to himself.

<em>Shit.</em>

<em>A voice from the source of Illyn&#39;s frustration greeted him... no, rather, from her side</em>

<em>A tall, ascetic figure stood by the &quot;foolish, stupid, infantile&quot; magus. She was plainly dressed, befitting the image of a humble clergywoman and nothing more. Her eyes were hidden for the most part by her veil, though the pursing of her lips at the terminus of her utterance toward him belied a slight struggling effort for each breath. Beyond that all, she was wholly unremarkable</em>

<em>That must have been why he hadn&#39;t noticed her before, mustn&#39;t it</em>

<em>Turning her head away, the apparently frail nun took her attention away from the stranger and to the girl closer to her instead. An attempt to speak toward her was made, though stifled by a series of coughs that were in kind covered by her hand. As the ills subsided however and with a clearing of the throat, she continued</em>

&quot;Now then, Miss Elise - you really must do better to not run off from me going forward. I&#39;m not so spry as I once was and the Church would be troubled heavily were I to fail in such a simple task as keeping track of you while you&#39;re out.&quot;

<em>Half truths scattered liberally, unlike her carefree summoner, the fastidious Caster made sure to frame every action and word in such a way as to appear as unassuming and impenetrable as possible. She was no one important, and while the girl beside her had already established herself as some one like himself, it was best to quickly tie her identity to that of a protected class instead of the target she actually was</em>

<em>&quot;Do you not think it might be ill advised to so freely use your magecraft while others may be scouting just as we are, contractor?&quot;</em>

<em>-and Alice so far proved to lack any tact in that or much any thing else, regrettably forcing Hildegard to employ a bit of extra coercion via their mental link.

The flowers that were in full bloom was something that added to the splendor of the city that he had been summoned to. Kalki had made such a wonder to enjoy the scenery, taking in heaping breaths of fresh air, his eyes constantly darted about the park as they moved about it. In previous conversation, they were going to go find a leyline within Bernice, but did they need to when the beauty of the world was so fleeting? 

His admiration continued even through their mission, enough to where while he had stayed close to his master, he would not allow such negative thoughts he could hear to cloud his tranquil mood. Not the hate of pollen, not the idea of him find the word towards his action, nothing. 

He had however, been receptive to the idea of his master calling his name, the man quick to peel his eyes from the beauty of the foliage and to his master&#39;s side. His gaze went to see what was the issue, finding a girl that seemed to also be enjoying the greenery instead, though not know what exactly she was doing with it. Kalki chuckled under his breath. <em>Is this what you have called me for, Master?</em> The thought transference as clear as day, His servant&#39;s voice was nothing short of a sort of confusion and amusement, baffled that he had been so quick to call a weapon his his side when he had clearly been ready to deal with it. Or had he wanted Kalki to deal with such. If so, he would be ready to materialize. 

Another voice had caught him off guard, the voice of a woman who had he glossed over before. Had she always been there? He hadn&#39;t noticed entirely, and yet he was sure he wouldn&#39;t have ignored such. In fact, he was presently aware that she would have been taken into account, but somehow, he felt odd that she could even have escaped his eye. She went on, scolding the young woman on her ignorance of hiding her magecraft, and yet, Kalki stayed in his spirit form, waiting.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095059337837301811 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095059337837301811><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 10, 2023 1:54 PM">1:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="animereader">@animereader &#128141;</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="saoria">@Saoria</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Illyn had already met with a sister of the Church before he had summoned Kalki. Who knew how many members of the Church had been dispatched to Benerice?

There was a far more logical solution. A strange individual paired alongside an obvious magus. Illyn allowed himself a smile.

As Hildegard mentally scolded Alice, Illyn did the same, verbally. &quot;Magecraft in public is proof of untrained mediocrity. Did they not teach you that in the Clock Tower&#39;s Department of Botany? Compose yourself before somebody sees you.&quot;

<em>Rider.</em> Illyn thought. <em>Keep an eye out.</em>

She observed him for a few moments unsure what to make of the figure in front of her. It was Caster&#39;s voice that finally compelled her into action. She stood up with a sense of false dignity, her cheeks turning red. It was an embarrassing ordeal. She responded to her servant via their mental link. Even through the telepathy her snappy tone could be felt 

&quot;I know that Caster. You don&#39;t need to remind me&quot;

It wasn’t as if she had purposefully casted a smell. Her craft was a part of her very nature. This occurrence was a simple side effect of her excitement. Now that she was aware she could bring it under control...

 The point of a tree branch had shot outward, quickly growing in length stopping a short distance from Illyn&#39;s face. A moment later it broke off from the tree and they would all witness an accelerated version of its life cycle as it eventually died and then later disintegrated to dust. Alice was now glaring at her fellow magus. She had felt slighted by his comment which had led to a flare up of her Magecraft again.

The verbal reprimand was something even he could feel was as cold as ice. And from teh moments of meeting his master, it was quite easy to know that if Illyn had made his mind, then it was something that was often not going to be changed afterwards. And, right now, with how the girl looked as if she were of sound mind, yet continued to allow such childish pubic displays of magecraft, he sadly couldn&#39;t disagree with such. It was a holy grail war, many masters had been plotting, not playing. 

Her response to his comment had clearly been something that was expected, an insult resulted in catastrophe, and with catastrophe, came violence. The tree branch that had made its way towards Illyn would have warranted a reaction, some would have easily done such, and yet in a sort of stoic stare, he waited. His master was well capable enough to handle these things, had he died to such, then would he really been ready to help his deceased loved one? So, Kalki stayed in his spirit form, his gaze unchanging, listening to the young woman&#39;s rebuttal.

<em>Ah, she seems to be quite upset with such a comment from you. . . I would hope that this is not how you treated your loved ones as well, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, you know? And speaking of flies. . . Who is that woman do all mages simply go and garden for free here? A caretaker? A parent?</em>

His questions had been truly puzzling, yet needed. If Illyn had said before that mages were always about showing themselves on the radio and such, it meant they exposed themselves often. . .So, had the other woman been such as well? Miss Elise, had been something that was once formal, so his latter idea was off the table, so what was she besides the first?

They should have stung. In fact, they <em>did</em> sting, slightly. No, that wasn&#39;t right. It wasn&#39;t that Alice&#39;s insults had demeaned Illyn, it was that he hadn&#39;t expected it coming. It was like picking up a penny and finding a silver dollar: unexpected.

Yet it didn&#39;t need to be unexpected. Illyn had walked up to a complete stranger and insulted them. Nonetheless magi were expected to be cautious. If you weren&#39;t cautious, then you were treated like a child playing with fire. Most magi were reserved, this one was not. 

&quot;Yes, the Department of Botany.&quot; Illyn said slowly, raising an eyebrow at the life and death of the vine. &quot;What would your professors say about such haphazard abuse? Though I must confess, botany never interested me much. Your magecraft, on the other hand...&quot;

Illyn cracked a smile.

&quot;<strong>Is very interesting.</strong> How does it work? For a vine to die so quickly, you&#39;re inspiring rapid cell growth and cell death... I never would&#39;ve thought of it! It&#39;s not my field, but it is quite splendid.&quot;

It was impossible for this person to be an assassin sent by the Clock Tower or Mage&#39;s Association. Enforcers were discrete, and if this was a trap, it was a poor one. It was far more likely that this woman was a... 

No, he shouldn&#39;t say it. Instead, he would think it.

<em>Rider, don&#39;t play dumb. It&#39;s beneath you and you insult me by proxy of summoning you. A magus and another individual? Magi operate alone. They don&#39;t trust anyone. No heir would be out here alone with no protection. Do the math. At minimum, a homunculus. At maximum...</em>

 &quot;Who was your lecturer at the Clock Tower and Department of Botany? Your name? Me and the Clock Tower go very far back. I might know them.&quot; Illyn responded kindly to Alice&#39;s lie. He wasn&#39;t aware that it <em>was</em> a lie, but Illyn wasn&#39;t exactly a social butterfly. He was, and had always been awkward.

She scoffed at the very suggestion that there would be someone in the clocktower who she would be forced to answer. As he spoke she looked past him absentmindedly at the remains of what had once been life. That hadn&#39;t been on the purpose it left her saddened that she had gone so far as to destroy a product of her nature. It hurt her soul just a bit

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Why I would sell the secrets of my family&#39;s well honed craft to a stranger in a foreign country.

Her responses to the magus remained cold and sharp as if her guard had been securely fastened. She waled past him sitting down on a nearby bench. She. breathed a sigh of relief. Walking around Bernice had been an experience she had never walked this much in a life. 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Sister what do you make of this strage man asking me all these questions.

She addressed the nun who accompanied her instead of answering his remaining questions. She was in part a little naive as to what she was describing this was indeed her first time speaking to a man in the wild but she also wanted to dodge his questions. While technically being a member of the Department of Botany she had rarely ever been allowed to step foot in it so she could hardly name any proffesors. This mage seemed knowledgeable so she didn&#39;t want any more holes poked into thier quickly crafted identities. Caster had been the first oenr to lie so she would have to commit to it.

&#39;Don&#39;t you think of this is odd Caster? This man clearly isn&#39;t a locale of the this area. He speaks of the Clocktower. So it isn&#39;t a stretch to assume he&#39;s from England. Being in Egypt at this time... Do you think this mage is perhaps a enemy?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He appraised Alice once over, and then the nun watching over her. Such a defense of one&#39;s treasures was something that Illyn understood, yet discarded all the same.

Secrecy only took one so far. The cost of progress was collaboration. Alice took great pride in her talents as a magus, and that was commendable. Illyn never cared to understand why magi separated themselves off. It was this isolationist nature that led to the decline of the Mage&#39;s Association and the mediocrity of the Clock Tower. When Illyn was younger, he remembered an alchemist being dispatched to aid the Holy Church on a mission. Something like that would be mocked by the Clock Tower.

&quot;Why?&quot; Illyn smiled mechanically. Emotions felt so far out of reach in moments like this. &quot;<strong>Because I&#39;ll show you mine freely.</strong>&quot; He reached into his pocket and produced a small music player.

He held it with absolute confidence. It was a tool that he had helped improve with his own brilliance. If needed, he would spend another lifetime making another. 

Illyn plucked a stray rose and held it over IBM. The rose vanished into the device. The flower&#39;s schematic was scanned. &quot;Most plants are made up of the same stuff, once you get down to it.&quot; Illyn projected the very same rose from the material already within IBM. Next, he plucked some grass and a few other flowers. &quot;This is a rudimental use, I&#39;ll confess, but it gets the point across.&quot;

A bouquet of roses appeared in his hands. He placed them down.

&quot;From dust comes life, then dust again.&quot;

The servant cocked a brow, curious as to why would anyone would have their own weapon go seen to anyone. Everyone hid their best card, and while he wasn’t sure it was a servant at all, it still did not seem to rack his brain at the possibility. 

He kept his mind mainly on the woman who seemed to do most of the talking, her servant a clear silent sentinel to her. She had continued to ask questions that only his master could answer, leaving Kalki to simply take in the scenery around him, only occasionally once again gleaning the conversation when Illyn’s tenor would be heard.  

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><em><strong>I’ll show you mine freely.</strong></em>
</div></div>
Another brow was cocked. Illyn revealing what he could do, felt odd enough to question, the rider cleared his throat, wary of the warning he had said earlier too, though he didn’t know if it would be good to question such.

<em>Shes right, you showing off magecraft to a potential mage who you don’t know is quite dangerous, are you sure that is something we should have done?</em>

He didn’t have the gal to stop whatever his master did, but he did have the power to question it. If she knew about what he could do, that could lead to complications along the road, he simply wanted to know if it would be best to reveal his hand so easily.

It&#39;s like sleight of hand. Like you&#39;re a magician on a stage.&quot; In truth, Illyn himself didn&#39;t care much about keeping himself secret now that he was talking to Alice. Especially since...

No, that would remain silent for a little while.

<em>It is an exchange of information. Information is meant to be traded and exchanged in pursuit of a higher goal.</em> 

A current trade meant that it kept options open later down the line. Illyn was not particularly loved by magi, so having the ability to exchange information was a novelty rarely afforded. If he and this girl traded secrets now, that would make both sides more willing to trade in the future.

Supposedly. 

&quot;I use a pocket dimension to analyze what things are made of, using this Mystic Code.&quot; Illyn tapped the device casually. &quot;Then, I can recreate the object via alchemy, if you&#39;ve learned the subject. It then uses a Projection spell to create it in reality. It&#39;s so close to perfect that it doesn&#39;t even traditionally vanish because of the Vos-Frienud Principal, which an Atlas alchemist discovered...&quot;

The entire group&#39;s eyes threatened to dull over with the lecture. Yet Illyn&#39;s eyes brightened as he continued to describe how his device used the last ten digits of pi in its calculations.

&quot;...and it also plays music.&quot; Illyn finally concluded his tirade. &quot;If you used your plant-based Magecraft and fed those plants into the device, it could perform the same Magecraft that you do.&quot;

So you transmute natural life while also giving it potential to grow. That&#39;s nothing like alchemy, where change is equivalent.&quot; Illyn frowned and leaned backwards, deep in thought. After a ponderous moment, he leaned forward. &quot;<strong>May I try it?</strong> Your Magecraft, I mean. If not, I understand.&quot;

To be a magus was to accept infinite outcomes. No route could be discarded. This was something that many magi forgot. They chased singular routes to their ideals in pursuit of a greater goal, not wondering if their path was correct.

Illyn went silent again. A song? Well, there was only one he knew. Art and expression was something he abandoned long ago. Yet he suspected that this is something that someone would do, if they were normal people.

Or maybe he wanted to sing. To fulfill this woman&#39;s request. He sighed. &quot;One moment.&quot; Illyn took a deep breath. His voice was hollow, and filled the air.

&quot;<em>Stop! In the name of love!</em>
<em>Before you break my heart.</em>
<em>Stop! In the name of love!</em>
<em>Before you break my heart.</em>
<em>Think it over, think it over!</em>

<em>I&#39;ve tried so hard, hard to be patient...</em>
<em>Hoping you&#39;ll stop this infatuation.</em>
<em>But each time you are together.</em>&quot;

Illyn&#39;s voice clipped and faltered.

<em>&quot;I&#39;m so... afraid of losing you forever.&quot;</em>

Silence. Illyn blinked once. Twice. Thrice. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Illyn said mechanically. &quot;I can&#39;t finish your request. It wasn&#39;t a very good rendition, anyway.&quot;

<em>Silence in reply at first, before calm applause and a gentle, genuine smile appeared on the superficially dim clergywoman&#39;s face. One might would expect an acclaimed composer such as her to scoff or turn her nose up at such a stilted display of musical comprehension... but of course, the Caster was a complex figure</em>

<em>Despite being one of the most prominent writers of song in her era, she had never received any training in how to actually write it - all that she learned on her own. Despite music in her time being predominantly male, her works pushed forward women as the dominant vocalists</em>

<em>Music was complex and appreciable as an art not because of perfection, but because of intent. And while his was misguided and not strictly asked for, given she had actually meant for it to ring from his device, Hildegard did legitimately appreciate the intent just the same</em>

&quot;Nuium nacoevum ispariz. You may disagree by your own judgement but... I thought it was very good. Take my words for what little worth they have. Or perhaps take Miss Elise&#39;s - beneath all the harshness, I know she has a good heart.&quot;

<em>She neither knew that nor particularly cared, it simply made for part of the good &quot;story&quot; she aimed to present. A series of coughs followed, her head sinking down once more to stare at the earth instead</em>

&quot;Ah... truly God&#39;s mercy lies with in each note and rest, even to all of creation, so undeserving. Could I have your name, young man? I will likely soon forget it, but... I am fond of remembering each tune I hear from another, trying to give it the name it came from.&quot;

<em>Of her many genuine faults, a lack of memory was not one of them. However she would forget all that occurred here after the war, that much was true. Until then though, it was wise to keep tabs on potential players</em>

She cooked her head in confusion. She didn&#39;t know whether to be offended or pleased by the question. Her craft was her family&#39;s work over the course of centuries. For this man to just try it haphazardly was a ludicrous thought. But of course her curiosity got the best of her. She had never encountered someone like this before she wanted to see what he would do next

As he began to sing she was only left with a frown. She had never heard the song before and it sounded off key. She had taken several different musical instruments from a young age. To her trained ears his every note brought her deep pain

It copies everything. Memories. Magecraft. Things. The copies are so close they don&#39;t get erased, like simple Projection Magecraft. It&#39;s under the Grundman Principle...&quot; Another speech of Magecraft that discussed concepts that flew over the heads of everyone. Even Alice, a well-trained magus, would feel countless theories and formulas wash over her.

There&#39;s one exception, however...&quot; Illyn explained as he shamelessly ignored Hildegard&#39;s response. How rude! He clapped his hands in excitement, though his eyes were as vacant as ever.

&quot;Spectacular. Thank you very much. Have a flower in exchange.&quot; Illyn said, placing a flower into Alice&#39;s hand, as if Alice&#39;s Magecraft was worth trading for a random plant. Illyn eyed a stray plant that Alice had been manipulating. He plucked it, and fed it to the device. After a moment, Illyn&#39;s magic circuits began to glow. 

Yet they glowed wrong. The circuitry within Illyn was abnormal, taking the shapes of odd geometric shapes, fractals, and shapes that were incomplete. &quot;So perfect... It tricks the world into thinking I&#39;m capable of it. It&#39;s the same as how people trick people into thinking that they&#39;re things that they&#39;re not.&quot;

Vines and grass sprouted around Illyn. His magecraft was shaky, faltering, and not as excellent as Alice&#39;s manipulation of her own craft. Yet it was clear that Illyn was using it.

&quot;<em>I&#39;m glad you liked the song.</em> Illyn suddenly said in response to Hildengard. &quot;<strong>I hate that song. I also love it.</strong> It&#39;s the only thing I, Illyn, am sure of. &quot; Slowly, Illyn&#39;s control over the plant-life began to tighten. After a few moments, he suddenly ended the spell.

&quot;You two are very interesting.&quot; Illyn inclined his head.

“Well, it seems that you two had had quite the fun outing. What have I missed?”

Kalki appeared before him, a pleasant smile on his lips as if he had been absent the entire time. From how materialized, it was evident immediately he was the man’s servant. But, from his demeanor, Kalki held to be no threat, rather, he gave his friendly facade his best try.

&quot;I say this with as much respect as I possibly can, but I hope to never see the two of you again. A fight with you two could only spell disaster for all of us.

So I&#39;ll be hoping for your destruction, in the most sincere way possible.&quot;

Turning away without a response, Illyn began walking down the path to the sounds of rustling bushes. He whistled as he walked away. He did not hear a rush of wind, or any proof at all that an attack was coming. He put the calculation at about 16%. Nonetheless, if they did strike, Rider would retaliate. Illyn was confident in his Servant&#39;s capability to atomize the park and protect his back, relying on anyone not named Illyn seemed like a waste. 

At least he had gained a new tool today. Illyn didn&#39;t feel satisfied, but he was complacent. That was as good as it got.

<em>Step. Step. Step.</em> Illyn&#39;s shoes clacked against the path as the leaves in the bushes rustled in the wind.

Illyn stopped.

&quot;<strong>Rider. Would you go and prepare the car for me? There&#39;s something I need to do.</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s tone was even and betrayed nothing.

It was troublesome to be truthful 

<div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content">Ah so you were a master after all

The flower had lowered and her smile disappeared the trance broken. Her face was unreadable much like a dolls. Her statement came as a note of confirmation. She had already expected as much. The pair before her were undoubtedly enemies now in her eyes. It seemed they had no intention to fight as the pair quickly began to move away. She made no attempts to stop them. She did nothing at all. She sat completely still until they had moved a fair distance away. She then muttered the name of the man she had just met

The flower he had given her now laid dead in her palm. If she was to meet him again he would have to die. That man who she had casually chatted to in this very spot would most certainly have to die. She supposed that was simply how war was. She had never killed someone before. She wondered what it would be like.

&#39;You kept your disguise on till the very end Caster. Was that necessary? Regardless I&#39;m tired let&#39;s return to my estate.&#39;

Not bothering to wait for a reply she had already stood up and after dropping the dead flower to the ground began to walk out of the park.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Ah, butler is not the correct term at all, ma&#39;am. I don&#39;t think he would treat me so roughly if I were someone who tended to his every whim. . . But, regardless, I am glad that he is in good hands. He tends to have a hard time making good company last.&quot;

The Rider kept his polite smile, even when his master bluntly hypothetically fired him in his head. See, difficult time with good company, his eyes at the elderly woman conveyed. With an exasperated yet hearty and good natured sigh, Kalki scratched his neck as Illyn plainly explained his intention and reasoning. He was correct though, while Kalki could have done his best to have slain the girl beside her without second thought, he had been cordial, mainly under his master&#39;s trustful gaze.

His assumption was correct, though he had been gone from their sight, he knew that protecting his master would have come easily as a simple misstep. But, as they returned home, Kalki kept his silence,
A brow was raised when Illyn said he had to do something, but to Rider, he tried to pay it no mind other than his normal bizarre moments he had. Rather, Kalki hummed his approval and continued towards the car, getting it ready so that once his master returned, they&#39;d head back to the solarium. However, in his own form of ignorance towards Illyn&#39;s whereabouts, he simply said in return. 

&quot;Ah, well please hurry Master, I have a craving for that Mango syrup I have found in the pantries. I&#39;d like to get some before it gets too late and watch the fireflies go about their rounds.&quot;

Not from joy, not from accomplishment, but from the statement of a Master who would soon be dead and buried. A Master who would become food for crows and fertilizer for plants that she so loved.

Not by his hand, no. An exchange of information was sacred among magi. Illyn was a lot of things, but he would honor that pact.

&quot;It is an unusual name.&quot; He told to the rustling bushes. &quot;Illyn. The corruption of the Arabic word for paradise or heaven. And they said that my mother never had a sense of humor.&quot; His tone faded as he regarded the rustling bush. It was a completely normal thing. It had been windy earlier, and yet...

<strong>The wind had stopped recently.</strong>

Without warning, Illyn&#39;s hand reached into the bushes and gripped the wrist of a child. With Alice&#39;s magecraft, he parted the bush to reveal a young boy. Illyn blinked once. &quot;Impressive.
