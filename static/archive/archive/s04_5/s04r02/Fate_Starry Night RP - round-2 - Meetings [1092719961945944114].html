It was night, they had agreed to move at night only once they arrived at Berenice as in her eyes this was basically a free for all enemy territory.  Still as they arrived more and more news of deaths appeared, while just a simple look at them would tell anyone that they weren&#39;t related for Gloria that was exactly what make them even more disturbing. Because that meant it wasn&#39;t just one pair doing this.

She didn&#39;t believed in coincidences, and such bizarre deaths could only mean the involvement of forces regular humans had no chance against. Or at least that was a very strong possibility one she was quite afraid if it resulted in it being true. 

&quot;If my hunch is right some people care little for rules or order...&quot; she clenched her fist in anger as she moved towards the location of one this bizarre murders aiming to check and see if her gut feeling was correct. &quot;...just our luck to arrive and already have a mess in our hand.&quot;

While she was pissed at master and servant doing something like this as it jeopardizes the ritual. The plain disregard of human life for no apparent reason was also fueling her anger. She was ready to die, she knew the consequences of her choices so she was at peace with that but this people were different they just woke up one day and suddenly found themselves wrapped into this mess without a warning and that cost them everything. 

&quot;Either way we may have just found out next target.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It does not surprise him at all, he knows there are likely people and like-minded beings that participate in the war solely to kill and torture others for their own sick pleasures. The Holy Grail is nothing but a cup to them, as they believe that their senseless violence in the form of their body count is the only thing worth achieving in the war.

In the end, it does not matter. It never mattered. It is all still killing and dying to Saber. Even if it never happened, it will never remove the horror of this ritual. Either way, if it starts becoming a major problem, then a response from the Church can be expected and it will be dealt with as soon as possible. For now, Saber and Gloria can try to resolve the issue on their own though it may come out to be an insurmountable task that cannot be done by just two.

&quot;Target?&quot; Saber is surprised that they are already picking a fight not long after getting to the island. Doing a taxing effort right after another is a feeling familiar to him but he sort of wants to relax and take in the night time aura at the moment.

While he does know it is quite dangerous in the night, especially during the Holy Grail War and the current violent state of the war itself, he still longs for a good rest. He had thought he could set things straight and do things he never got to do in life but it appears that circumstances put him on a depressing road so familiar to him. Saber looks pretty upset and sighs to express his feelings.

&quot;Didn&#39;t know you were this bloodlusted, Master. How about we just let them do their thing for now?&quot; Saber&#39;s melancholic look turned into a smile as he tried to make light of the situation through a little tease.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Hallbjorn didn&#39;t care.

He was no Storyteller. Not for the time being. Maybe at a different opportunity, or a different circumstance, but Hallbjorn had neither the time nor the attention to spare. 

There was a war to be won.
It&#39;d be inappropriate for a tale to take precedence over victory.
If it meant fulfilling his desire he was more than willing to suppress his desire to orate.

However, these murders <em>did</em> provide him a much needed opportunity.

<em><strong>hooooo</strong></em>...

A deep inhale, taking in all the nearby scents... <strong>got it</strong>.

After picking up that scent, one that every living being in the world could recognize more than any other, the Again-walker quickly blitzed through the streets of the city, avoiding open areas and preferring alleyways to make his way to where that scent would be found.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="discord_assets/KN9vhH8-D23D5.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/KN9vhH8-D23D5.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: KN9vhH8.png (668.24 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092969547402846249 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092969547402846249><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 7:30 PM">7:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><u>The smell of death</u>.

He got his fill of a rotted corpse from the cemetery, a hole in the ground that someone would surely notice by morning, but it wouldn&#39;t compare to a fresh body when it came to recovering energy. 

If those on the island were winding up dead anyways, might as well make use of it.

The faster he finished his meal and left the better -- He tore them off the shoulder joints of the corpse, freshly killed within the last hour by a still-unknown perpetrator, and stuffed them in his mouth to sate his hunger.

A more noble man might have rushed to hunt down the killer, considering they couldn&#39;t have gone too far.

One does not protest when another desires food or drink. It made no sense, at least for Li Ji, to raise any objection to her Master&#39;s needs. If it is what he needs to survive, then there is no reason to find it weird. To the Serpent Slayer, that was the only thing that mattered--- Victory in this survival game, come what way. The string of murders did not move her heart one bit.

Well.

Perhaps only a little.

<em><strong>&quot;I would like to murder the murderer.&quot;</strong></em> 

A silent, cold, bloodlust settled in the mind of the legendary heroine. Violence was always close to her heart from the start, and this was no different. Far be it for a Heroic Spirit as her to concern herself with matters like this, however. The woman was distant from the world, seeing it only from the detached perspective of the macro, an unknown murderer represented nothing more than one&#39;s own twisted ego. Without any further context at least. 

That--- Was something Li Ji could permit. 

But, there was something Li Ji could <em>not</em> permit.

While her ghoulish Master was feasting, he was unceremoniously interrupted by two unwanted guests. The senses of a Sage were well attuned to the world, after all, sensing another Servant approaching was but a simple task. 

She stood in the way of her Master, with nothing in her hand. A cold, icy gaze and an expression devoid of any emotion, as her frosty words echoed in the night.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093087908250013707 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093087908250013707><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 3:21 AM">3:21 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><strong>&quot;Fight, if you wish.&quot;</strong>

...No effort to protect her Master at all? She twisted her body to the side, as though granting passage for the Servant-Master pair to challenge her own Master. 

<strong>&quot;Only her, however.&quot;</strong>

Her glare turned to the opponent Saber, taking a more guarded stance against the Heroic Spirit. This--- Was her idea of &#39;fair and square&#39;. This--- Was the most important thing for her Master to do. To prove in front of her, right here and now, his worth and preparedness. How much is he willing to put on the line in order to win, in order to prove that he was neither a &#39;weakling&#39; nor a &#39;coward&#39;. A battle between mortals, free from the interference of their Servants. 

<strong>&quot;Try taking another step as a pair. See what happens.&quot;</strong>

An expression that remained static even as she delivered a threat. There was absolutely no discernible information about the woman at all, safe for her Chinese clothes and thorny demeanour. Whether there was bloodlust in her words, or there was preparedness, alertness, anything at all--- It was almost as though reading words on screen, devoid of any context behind them.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Located only miles away by taxi from their hotel, Karl had found the place while scrolling through some brochures placed in the room. He was quite hesitant at first, but decided that there was no harm in having a little bit of fun and exploring the local cuisine of Egypt. Thus, he had begged for the gentle giant&#39;s permission to leave the room and after some slight debating and hesitation from Afonso, after all leaving in the middle of the night to eat was not the smartest choice the boy could make, he agreed to accompany him. Karl sprung up in joy and they had quickly taken and cab and ended up in the entrance of this restaurant.</em>

From the outside, the building and its architecture seemed welcoming, furthermore it was placed not far away from the city centre and Karl planned to go on a late night stroll now that he had escaped from the tower he had been locked in, it might seem like an slight overexertion, but the boy was slightly hyperactive. Dressed in a white shirt and blue jeans, the boy stood out amongst the crowd of locals, both his skin complexion was lighter and his hair, a dark peach colour, made it obvious he was not a local the minute he stepped in. Taking into account that it was the middle of the night, the restaurant was surprisingly both open and not entirely empty, with a teenage couple situated in one of the tables on the left. 

Karl smiled and took a seat while looking at Afonso the entire time. He looked at the menu and sighed with relief when he was able to find the translated version, skimming through it quickly. He decided to congratulate himself for the successful journey thus far by ordering a &quot;feast&quot;. The waiter, a tired young fellow with visible dark circles under his eyes, came quickly and asked him for his order. Karl continued to speak quickly and filled with joy. He order 4 kebabs, 2 plates of ful and 2 large Cokes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093273135408750592 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093273135408750592><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 3:37 PM">3:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The order was written in a scribbled manner due to the young man not being able to catch up with the information he was bombarded with. A big grin was plastered on Karl&#39;s face as he stretched and finally looked at a TV for what had seemed like ages, the news were weird. He could not understand much due to not knowing the language, but from what he could make up from seeing the pictures and animations, they revolved around a series of murders occurring in the small city. Karl felt uneasy as he looked out of a window in front of him. The darkness and uncertainty of the night made goosebumps visible on his screen as he aimed to start talking with Afonso, he looked at the Servant and asked, depending whether Afonso had decided to go in spiritual or materialised form inside the restaurant would make the conversation appear as normal or make the waiter think Karl was a lunatic tourist:

&quot;You think whatever is happening involves the War? Also, are you as hungry as me Moniz, - the words were said ironically as Karl giggled like a child, - Or maybe I am the only one this hungry? To be honest, the reason why I wanted to leave the room was to see the city at night. So...as soon as I finish eating, we shall become Explorers of this unknown land!&quot;

He tried to make the servant laugh and was uncertain whether or not the joke was even funny, but it made him smile. He yet again admired the Heroic Spirit in front of him, it was unbelievable that the Great King of Portugal had answered his call and it made his heart fill with warmth. He grabbed a near by napkin and placed it on his lap, as he waited patiently for the food to arrive.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Part of her disliked knowing that smell so well but this wasn&#39;t the moments to worry about it. 

&quot;Is not just bloodlust, I rather deal with a problem before it becomes a big one&quot; A logical response to Saber teasing one which also hide her true feelings when it came to this situation. But while she had those the logic she used was also true. 

&quot;For me there are 2 types of murders, those which have a purpose and those which don&#39;t&quot; It was true in so many ways. If whoever was killing innocent people was doing it for sport or just some sick need that was the lesser evil. But if this deaths had a purpose for them if somehow they could be using them to become more powerful then stopping it was a priority. &quot;I rather not find one which one is this case in a bad way.&quot;

It was then that she heard sounds, yes this was an area where murders had happened before but the strong smell which guide her made her realize it had happened again. 

&quot;Saber keep an eye for a servant!&quot; she yelled as she move towards where the smell was stronger. I was then where she saw the pair. The other servant words became blurred as she saw the man doing something akin to eating a corpse. Such method didn&#39;t seem to fit whatever she had read so another one? Honestly she didn&#39;t care at all about such details right now. 

That person needed to die, it needed to dissapear or someday even if it didn&#39;t win he may find its path towards her home, towards her child. She moved forward and pulled her guns without a care of what Li Ji may do to her. 

&quot;I will deal with him you watch my back Saber&quot; she said as began to slowly move faster aiming her guns at Hallbjorn and shooting 2 regular fire rounds at him. 

&quot;I will destroy you monster!!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He is not exactly indifferent to killing, but it is more like he has already grown insensitive to such thoughts. Killing is killing, there is no other thought that comes to his mind than that. In spite of these however, Saber, in a hypocritical way, is still disgusted, or rather, offended by senseless violence.

It really reeks like crazy here, Saber thought. It was not long until he too saw the scene in front of them. That&#39;s a repulsing sight alright. Shaking his head, he took a quick scan of his surroundings before focusing his eyes on, what could be, a Servant as soon after they spoke.

...

I would like to murder the murderer? Only her, however? What in the heavens is this guy talking about, Saber thought. They, well, <em>she</em> definitely doesn&#39;t look amiable, she&#39;s already preparing for a fight not long after her eyes laid on him. His focus is broken after Gloria began to engage. Quick on his feet, he pulled Gloria back by the collar to prevent her from going further.

&quot;Master! Let&#39;s think this through for a bit.&quot;

Saber has done a bit of thinking himself and he is not about to lose it due to recklessness... recklessness? No, now&#39;s not the time. Weighing the tools at their disposal to the situation they are currently in, Saber has constructed a simple strategy. That strategy being... shooting at them from afar.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093475898138824736 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093475898138824736><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 5:02 AM">5:02 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The idea here is that, since Saber and Gloria does not know their opponent, they should test how they would react using safe attacks such as gunfire.

Saber smirked at his own thoughts. If they&#39;re not going to test them first, then Saber and Gloria would be taking the initiative instead. Just a little bit of human science, Saber thought. It is time to observe the reaction and test the product.

&quot;Master, I&#39;d suggest we test our tools on them from here&quot;, Saber whispered his suggestion while gesturing to Gloria&#39;s firearm.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Besides, even if Karl somehow refused to hear his words of warning and left on his own, he had intended to follow him in his spiritual form without the other noticing his presence.</em>
 
<em>Which lead them to the entrance of the local restaurant where they would eat today&#39;s dinner.

<em>With the table found and a seat secured for both of them, Saber gave a quick glance around the restaurant noticing that while it was far from crowded unlike some other locations he had seen so far, it wasn&#39;t entirely empty either. Just some locals and a young couple in a date. None of them a threat by any mean, so it seemed the servant had been worried for nothing. In fact, his master was much more of a threat to the exhausted employee that had received Karl&#39;s rather enormous request.</em>

<em>It was while they waited for the feast that the television situated in the restaurant began to displaying the news of major incidents from previous days. Unlike Karl, Saber didn&#39;t seem to struggle on getting the information from it despite the both of them reaching the same conclusion.

What a... &#39;Weak&#39; philosophy, Li Ji thought to herself. An ideology that relents to the will of others and is shaped by the ideology and philosophy of others. An approach that haughtily places one&#39;s self as judge, and yet, simultaneously, places so little agency on the individual when it comes to approaching such topics. For the Serpent-Slayer, the philosophy was clear from the start---- &#39;You simply have to justify it to yourself.&#39; That was why she had no qualms with Hallbjorn&#39;s killings.

Why she had no qualms with his &#39;actions&#39;. 

He had justified his need to himself, and he was determined to break any taboo and go to any depth to undertake it, without ever needing to justify it nor explain it to others. Such a philosophy could not belong to a &#39;weakling&#39;, but that did not rule out a &#39;coward&#39;. That was why she wanted Hallbjorn to fight this unknown master by himself. See how far he was willing to go to fight. See the depths of determination in order to assert his desire to this suffocating world. 

The &#39;strength&#39; or &#39;weakness&#39; of others did not make a difference to Li Ji, however. Any who stood in her path will be slayed. It was a simple philosophy coming from a simple woman, a self-centered maelstrom of egotism that would not bend to any other will. 

Conversely--- If she did not wish to slay, then even if heaven and earth moved, her mind would not be changed. 

<strong>&quot;I think I made myself clear.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;I hate repeating myself.&quot;</strong>

Li Ji made no effort to defend her Master, even slightly.

A betrayal of the typical Master-Servant dynamic, the madwoman seemingly unconcerned with her Master&#39;s safety. But, to the Serpent-Slayer, if he cannot defend himself from just this, if he doesn&#39;t show the determination to fight through even this, then he was never worthy in the first place.

<u>This is a test for Hallbjorn, rather than anything else.</u></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093486897118060635 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093486897118060635><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 5:46 AM">5:46 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She spared a momentary glance at him, still unfeeling and blank as ever. A silent message for the Draugr that did not need to be spelt out.

&#39;Fight, if you want to live.&#39;

But returning to the matter at hand--- She returned her focus to the enemy Servant once more. No muscle was moved, no change in expression, tone--- Anything <em>at all</em> could be noticed. All that they could see was a woman standing passively, limbs lazily by her sides making no effort to defend or fight. 

<strong>&quot;Your Master shall fight mine one on one.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;There is no &#39;we&#39; and &#39;them&#39;.&quot;</strong>

<strong>&quot;Try taking another step as a pair. See what happens.&quot;</strong>

She delivered her lines with stark monotone. Like a TV stuck on repeat, playing the same lines over and over with no variation. 

Yet again, a threat delivered without any intent of harm, any intent of following through, any intent of... Anything. It sounded like a script being read by an actress utterly disinterested in what was happening.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That wasn&#39;t a word Hallbjorn enjoyed.

<em><strong>BANG BANG!!</strong></em> -- Two flame bullets lit up the nightfallen alleyway, illuminating the eyes of all parties present with a vibrant red-and-orange hue that reflected off their irises.

... All but <em>one</em> present. 

No amount of light would bring life back to the dead&#39;s eyes.

The streaks pierced cleanly through their target, once in the shoulder and another through the cest, almost as if there was nothing there at all, passing through the body of he whose arms and mouth were drenched in blood, colliding with the nearest wall that came after.

... That should&#39;ve been enough... no...?

<u>The walking corpse&#39;s fist slammed into the ground, pushing himself back to his feet</u>.

&#39;Justice&#39;.
&#39;Indifference&#39;.
&#39;Strength&#39;.

Contrary to how things appeared... Hallbjorn was never fond of killing. Even after hundreds of years of rot and decay, that never changed. It was one of the many things he hated about himself -- a flesheater inevitably had to resort to murder if it meant survival.

&#39;You simply have to justify it to yourself&#39;. That was not something Hallbjorn could ever do. But...

&#39;Need&#39;.
&#39;Envy&#39;.
&#39;Desperation&#39;.

Hallbjorn didn&#39;t need to &#39;justify&#39; it.

There was no &#39;good&#39;.
There was no &#39;evil&#39;.
There was only his &#39;<strong>heart&#39;s desire</strong>&#39;.

So long as he held onto that he&#39;d <u>stand back up again</u>. No matter how many times he fell, physically or morally.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093808762915131462 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093808762915131462><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 3:05 AM">3:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Back on his feet, the Draugr knelt down and ripped the heart from the now masticated corpse with his bare hands, <span class="chatlog__markdown-spoiler chatlog__markdown-spoiler--hidden" onclick="showSpoiler(event, this)">lifting it up to his mouth and gorging half of it</span>, blood trickling down his chin as the dense energy within the human body&#39;s most vital organ entered within him, the two burnt bullet wounds on his body beginning to repair themselves already.

To clarify Gloria had no idea what Hallbjorn was as far as she was concerned she could be human. Her use of the word monster was purely her opinion on his behavior.  But honestly she didn&#39;t care, he was a danger regardless and someone who eat other was someone too dangerous to try and form an alliance. 

But she got a more concrete answer as she saw how the wounds made from her bullets seemed to regenerate as he consume the human heart. She was being reckless, but while most of the time the line between recklessness and sheer stupidity was hard to separate one needs to remember that both are not the same. 

She had a habit of observing their enemies, it was sort of a necessity for her as even through her recklessness she knew she couldn&#39;t win in a straight out fight. 

&quot;You are a problematic one...&quot; she said voicing her own frustration as an opponent which could easily take bullets was gonna be some sort of problem. Still his lack of initative still tell her something or at the very least it her guess. Either he was so strong her didn&#39;t even need to try or he wasn&#39;t used to fights. Well neither changed her what she had to do. 

He lift her guns once again taking advantage of the opportunity to move first. 

&quot;Ignia&quot; she said as pulled the trigger just like last time except instead of a regular fire bullet a fire beam came from the gun aiming to burn Hallbjorn face as she ready her second gun in order to shoot when he aimed to dodge</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber shook his head and went to face the lady warrior, or &#39;young damsel&#39; as the crooked-looking guy said.

 &quot;I believe you didn&#39;t expect me to leave you alone.&quot;

Saber gazes intensely at the Servant with his hand inching to the hilt of his weapon. While they &#39;agreed&#39; to let their Masters fight each other, he can&#39;t exactly ignore her. She could take back her words and move for a cheap shot at Gloria and end their journey to the Grail right then and there.

 &quot;Keep that attitude up and you&#39;ll age real fast.
—Would be a waste of a pretty face.&quot;

Saber chuckled a bit as he teases his potential opponent. Would be a shame to stain her appearance in bruises and scars but, unfortunately, he has to exercise some <em>precautionary measures</em> lest his Master gets offed by this lady. Those measures being to off her first.

Geez... just staring at her makes me depressed, Saber thought. While Saber can&#39;t properly gauge the threat she potentially makes as she&#39;s just standing there menacingly, he&#39;s not going to take any chances by leaving her alone. It does not help that she acts and speaks like a robot too. Whether she&#39;s genuine in leaving the Masters alone to fight or not, a risk is a risk and it must be addressed as soon as possible.

 &quot;You get to keep your beauty in death though. I can even help you with that.&quot;

Saber draws his sword from his waist belt. Sliding his fingers across the wave-shaped blade of the sword, the air around it swirls in response. Finishing the motion, he raises his sword over his head before breaking into a stance. From this little performance of his alone, Saber made it clear that he is looking for a fight.

Either way, he&#39;s going to have to put down either the Master, the Servant, or both of them anyways. There&#39;s only so much his Master can endure, and Saber is not willing to find out the limits to her strength as a magus. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber&#39;s impassioned words and flashy moves was met with... Abject detachment. Yet again, Li Ji showed very little reaction to anything and everything that happened around her, the ice-cold Damsel of Calamity responding with complete silence and a distant stare at her potential &#39;opponent&#39;. 

<strong>&quot;I actually expected that.&quot;</strong>

Flatly, she responded. That was the only thing she responded to, though. Everything else about the teases and slight off-axis flirty commands went completely ignored. Or perhaps unnoticed? Rather than making an active effort at not giving such comments any thought, it seemed more like she had no idea how to respond to it... However, her reply shed a little more insight into her deceptively simple mindset.

She was not a woman who would ever state a <em>lie</em>. She would state her desires and wishes plainly and simply, though she was willing to use whatever rhetoric to get her way. Hence, the threats.

<strong>&quot;If my Master dies here and now then he&#39;s simply too weak to win the Grail War in the first place.&quot;</strong>

To say Saber &#39;trusted&#39; her Master was... A bit of an optimistic statement. Rather than trust, it was an implicit understanding between two people after the same thing, and with a similar &#39;whatever it takes&#39; attitude when it comes to reaching their goal. 

There was no good.
There was no evil.
There was only &#39;<strong>one&#39;s own will</strong>&#39;. 

She spared a glance to watch her Master regenerate his wounded, mangled body. A comforting sight for her, but not because she saw he was fine; It was because she saw he was still standing, still fighting. Good. That was what she wanted to see from the very beginning. That was what she <em>needed</em> to see. That determination to dig deep and stare down any impossible odd, and say simply--- &#39;I will do it.&#39; 

Just like how she felt staring down that dragon...

<strong>&quot;I gain nothing out of fighting you, nor your Master here.&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094457307607339038 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094457307607339038><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 8, 2023 10:02 PM">10:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...Her iridescent grey eyes briefly closed, before locking in once more on the enemy Saber. &#39;If he wins then you&#39;re out of the picture too.&#39; That was the line of logic Saber was operating under. If her Master was too weak to survive the first encounter--- Then frankly, he would be eliminated in the world she sought after, too. 

No skin off her back.

<strong>&quot;But, if you insist.&quot;</strong>

Saber took one step forward.

Just one, simple, single step.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="discord_assets/image-5E7DF.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/image-5E7DF.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (392.01 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094457319733067866 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094457319733067866><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 8, 2023 10:02 PM">10:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Yet it felt as though an earthquake has shaken the district.

A small, localized quake, likely a magnitude 3 or 4, with her feet as the epicentre. 

<strong>&quot;Come at me with killing intent.&quot;</strong>

Conversely, there was still no such intent behind any of Saber&#39;s words and actions. Everything about her inner machinations wrapped up by an invisible veil that let out only the &#39;results&#39; of her actions. Words delivered plainly without intonation nor inflection, actions happening without any &#39;tells&#39; that would indicate what she would do next.

It&#39;s difficult to communicate with someone like this.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Using one of her guns to fire at the enemy to force an action, while holding onto her second shot to fire at the enemy&#39;s action as a reaction. &#39;The move made last is the move that would succeed&#39;. A very basic strategic principle that made use of patience to gather information before making the best possible move at the last reasonable moment.

Gloria&#39;s actions had created a combat situation where &#39;the moment Hallbjorn responds, she will shoot him to counter the dodge&#39;.

<strong>Hallbjorn next move had to rupture that foundation</strong>.

And so, as he ducked beneath the beam of flame firing over his head, he <u>reached out his foot and hooked onto the masciated corpse with his toes, lifting it up and grabbing onto it as he charged towards Gloria, halfway through his sprint tossing it at her to occupy her attention</u>.

Did he expect the corpse to act as a shield? Absolutely not, even her weaker bullets from earlier penetrated through his body effortlessly.

What it <em>would</em> do, however, is act as a <u>curtain</u> to obscure his figure. Like putting a piece of paper in front of the target, it&#39;d make landing a precise shot, or even landing a shot at all, much more difficlt.

<u>By denying Gloria information, he&#39;d nullify the advantage gained by &#39;moving last&#39;</u>.

The earthquake caused by Li Ji stomping her foot into the ground only helped -- it was difficult to aim as precisely with the ground shaking beneath all their feet.

In that moment he dashed towards the gunslinger... could he get close enough to land a fatal blow?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Karl responded to Alfonsos&#39; question as he awaited for the plates to arrive. The atmosphere of the diner was quiet, the sizzling grilling could be heard in the background and chatter from what little customers remained. The early hours of the morning had already arrived as the news on the TV shifted from sudden and bizarre events happening all over world, including his home country, he worried about his parents. He hoped they were doing alright, his mother had a weak heart and the departure had most definitely had an impact on her. Being overseas, Karl could not help but notice how different he felt, he was secluded from the small communities he had been raised in. It reminded him of life back in The Clock Tower, but at the same time it felt different. Like something was missing, he was blankly staring at the TV on the wall, thinking, his mind having dived deep into the abyss of thought. He stopped smiling for a sudden moment and turned towards Afonso and then it hit him.

The ground began shaking, it was an earthquake from what it seemed, having previously sat on the edge of his seat, Karl unfortunately fell, but it was even more of an unfortunate event for the waiter, which while delivering the food to the duo and not trying to let the dishes fall was hit by the sudden weight of the boy. The dishes with the delicious food fell and shattered on the ground, Karl bumped his head on the clean tiled floor and laughed. He was the only one laughing, everyone else in the diner looked at him with anger or disgust and the waiter just enough had it and began screaming at the boy. The words made no sense to him, maybe due to the thick accent that was being used or due to Karl not wanting to pay attention, he only realised that the man had become angered with him when he felt a rough hand pull his ear. Ouch! It hurt and he looked at the man, begging for forgiveness, pleading like a small child: &quot;I will leave! Please, let go of my ear!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095784805058236537 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095784805058236537><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 1:57 PM">1:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The man looked at him with the most joyous smile since they had entered the small restaurant, saying two simple words: “Please, leave!”.

Karl had a startled expression as he got up and held his ear, which by now was hurting. The few people in the diner had bursted out laughing, the situation was not funny! Though Karl, as his stomach grumbled, he was hungry and it was obvious the man would not agree to serve him any other dishes. The earthquake had not lasted long, but the cause of it was not too concerning for Karl, maybe it would be more concerning if he knew that the region was not infamous for its earthquakes. But, he had yet to gain that information. He looked at Afonso with teary eyes and light rosy blush on his face, saying:

“I wanna go eat somewhere else! The man was rude! He was rude!”

Karl proclaimed angrily as he awaited for Afonso to respond. The waiter looked at him with a cold gaze, staring and waiting for him to exit. Maybe he was the owner of the place, maybe he was just a simple waiter, who knows, one thing was for certain the series of unfortunate events that had happened made him, naturally, despise the youngster. Karl, on the other hand, did not hold any grudges or hate the man. If Afonso happened to ask him, he would easily respond that it was not his fault for acting the way he did towards Karl. He was truly a gentle soul, there was no place left in it for holding grudges or hate. He asked to eat somewhere else only for the man to feel more comfortable and serve the customers, what little was left of them, quickly and happily. After all, a good service was the most important thing while dining out!</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a harsh truth she had come to accept since an early age, she wasn&#39;t meant for a straight out brawls at least not in normal circumstances. So through her whole career she had always fight with that idea on her mind. That didn&#39;t meant she was useless on close quarters but like with her fight with Lucca once reached that point it could easily go either way.

&#39;Gotcha&#39;  She though as the enemy was moving according to what had predicted. Except just like it had happened before the plan wouldn&#39;t go as she had expected. Hallbjorn had dodged the beam of flames, that was okay that was expected for Gloria, without even having to think about her second handgun had move lower and her finger was ready to pull the trigger except her whole vision was obscured by the corpse thrown at her. 

&quot;You little,..&quot; it was hard to blame her for feeling frustrated. She stood her ground as though what to do, time seemed to slow down as she tried to think a way out of what was happening to her. Were she do nothing and let the corpse hit her it could affect ability to react to Hallbjorn next move , so she needed to deal with that but at the same time her focus would give the enemy an opening. 

Just like she had done to him, she was now in a really dangerous crossroads as either choice could mean her death, 

All she could do was gamble and aim for the better odds, she pulled the trigger the fire beam ripped through the body of the poor victim. Both his guns were in cooldown, she could shoot any more projectiles so if Hallbjorn were to get too close she was doomed. 

&quot;Ignia&quot; she said softly. 

A white flame began to gather around her feet and ice spikes began to sprout around her in a circle motion. The ice spikes were not meant to stop Hallbjorn assault but to delay him enough to give her a chance to respond. Then again it all depended on how he reacted to it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her problems aren&#39;t his, so he has no reason to consider what she has to gain from this fight. How self-centered of the lady warrior, hmph! There is only one thought in his mind, that is to neutralize this Master-Servant pair.

 &quot;?!&quot;

Rumble, rumble, rumble... Saber was thrown off balance by the ground shaking, stumbling a bit before picking himself up. It is not as if Saber has never encountered similar feats from his adversaries in life before, however it is a surprise nonetheless. The lady warrior must be pretty strong, is she a Berserker-class servant?

 &quot;Whoa... you sure got some weight on you!&quot;

Saber made some wisecrack in response to the Servant&#39;s ground-shaking step. Saying this may make him sound arrogant, but it is his way of keeping his composure through tension. There is nothing for Saber to fear though, his trust in his skill and experience in slaying enemies of a similar caliber is immovable.

Come at her with killing intent? The lady says it as if it is not a given. To kill the other pair is the ultimate goal in any battle in this war... and Saber is going to do exactly that. The moment one strays from the main concept of the ritual, they&#39;ll be wiped out.

 &quot;...
—Perhaps tearing off your breasts will relieve the burden.&quot;

Saber prepared to initiate an interaction with the enemy Servant. He has taken note of two major things about this one: her strength and attitude. Without a doubt, this Servant&#39;s definitely tough. Saber&#39;s going to have to be careful up close lest he gets handled. A novice technique such as reading her face won&#39;t work, but it won&#39;t be a problem as her muscles will never lie.

Though Gloria may seem to be in a pickle, Saber won&#39;t be intervening in their fight. Not out of respect for the enemy but simply because it may potentially encourage the opposing Servant to do the same. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096617719639588944 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096617719639588944><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 9:07 PM">9:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Such a shame, he has a cheap shot on the enemy Master too.

Weighing his options, Saber begins his interaction by closing the distance between him and the enemy by briskly running towards her. It is a simple approach but it is an approach nonetheless. While the risk of entering the opponent&#39;s effective range unprotected is present, Saber can employ hasty evasive maneuvers if needed. Nothing fancy for now, just trying to learn more about the lady. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

What was &#39;death&#39;, really? 

A crossroads between this world and the afterlife?
The natural conclusion to a battle between enemies?
Or even a new beginning?

Even after all this time, Hallbjorn didn&#39;t know.

He&#39;d &#39;died&#39; once before when the raiders came, but his envy made him walk again.
He&#39;d &#39;died&#39; over and over after numerous fights, but this body of his pushed itself back up to its feet.

His heart was cold. It hadn&#39;t beat in hundreds of years.

Yet still, he didn&#39;t know what &#39;death&#39; was.

Or maybe it was because he was dealt it countless times, more than he could possibly remember, that he could no longer know what it was.

He did know, however, that <u>the life he was living right now was a fate worse than it</u>.

His <u>only choice</u> was to find victory in this Holy Grail War.
And if he failed?
That meant it was all he was going to accomplish.

Line-of-sight was a two-way street after all... but the split between the legs offered a small window for Hallbjorn to peek through, allowing him to spot the white flame beginning to gather around her feet, as well as the ice spikes shooting outwards.

If she couldn&#39;t see him, then she just had to use an attack that required no precise aiming. A logical conclusion. It was to be expected -- no course of action that he took was going to be foolproof. Every choice made within battle was one with potential holes and weaknesses.

That was a truth that went both ways.

That circular attack had one weakspot: <strong>above</strong>.

Kicking himself up from the ground, Hallbjorn aimed to launch himself above the ice spikes, the arc of his jump going about half a meter above Gloria&#39;s head, at which point a pale flame would coat his right arm.

If he managed to make the distance, his hands would grip onto her face, pushing her to the ground and letting the pale flame&#39;s curse take its toll.

At least to a certain degree. She had little to no other option when she used her ice flames it was either to use a ranged attack or just do a shot in the dark hoping that it will land. The later was just hopeful thinking with little to no chance of actually succeeding.

So for Gloria there was the truly only one option. Yet even then it didn&#39;t make it flawless, someone with overwhelming physical or magical power could simply break through the spikes and kill her without giving her any chance to do anything. If time were to allow it she would consider if Hallbjorn truly lacked the firepower but she couldn&#39;t allow her mind to be distracted.

Her main concern was to find him, her eyes scanned the area around her as fast as it was humanly possible and as she saw nothing she moved her head upwards on pure instinct. This was a gamble to a degree, in that small frame of time it was impossible for her to be sure that Hallbjorn was up but she had to risk it. 

She was right and she saw how his was falling down ready to strike on her but once again the same question popped for her. 

&#39;what now?&#39; one of her guns was no longer in cooldown but would that be enough? Many possibilities run through her mind as she stood her ground. Crimson flames began to dance around her, as she decided that the most simple approach would be the best. 

&quot;Ignia!!&quot; she yelled, a crimson arm formed next to her and  with great power and precision it thrusted upward. 

Hallbjorn pale flame would meet Gloria&#39;s fiery construction. Both flames clashing in the space between the two masters with neither willing to back down creating a concentration of mana which others around them could feel but it wasn&#39;t something Gloria could concern herself with. An explosion would engulf both master leaving unknown how either fare to the clash as smoke filled the area leaving each state to the other imagination</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Taking a deep breath he looked down at his feet,he had begun running as fast as he could(without the use of Magecraft that is), his body acting on his own as he began heading towards the lighted area. The dim lit street once again surrounding him as his steps echoed all through out the area. The boy&#39;s breathing became heavier and sweat covering his body. He had run up to a lost of breath arriving at the scene of the fighting. He could feel the presence of more than two figures, the heat created by the flames and the loss of breath getting to him. The carbon oxide in the smoke made it harder for him to breath as he began coughing and trying to cover his mouth with the sleeves of his shirt. He had to think fast, he had to do something. Separating the two Magi, if they were Magi that is, Karl decided to intensify the explosion caused by the two pillars of flame</em>

<em>Particle Magecraft, the Crown Jewel of the von Ro&#223;mann family, it was time for Afonso to witness it at its true sight. Searching in his pockets with his left hand, with his right hand he was covering his mouth and nose as to not inhale too much of the smoke, he found a small coin in his pocket. The words &#39;Aufgliedern&#39; coming out of his mouth, the chemical composition of the coin was projected in his mind, Copper. With this information it was time to move onto the next step, he tried to calm himself as his hands began shaking due to the consequences his plan could have towards the duo battling out. His glare having now taken a blank and cold expression the plan was ready.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103420933840060538 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103420933840060538><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 3, 2023 3:40 PM">3:40 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Zirconium was the element playing the lead role in Karl&#39;s plan.

Fortunately, to lighten the load on Karl&#39;s mind, even a massive explosion like that wouldn&#39;t be enough to end the Dragur&#39;s unlife. Though, that wouldn&#39;t change how unpleasant the sight would be.

Hallbjorn shakily pushed himself back to his feet, the ignition from the explosion lighting his cloak ablaze and giving him a silouette of a burning ghost. It&#39;d eventually fall off his shoulders, too damaged to stay intact.

Even in the darkness of night all nearby parties could see it: the gaunt, rotting corpse of a man that was Hallbjorn. A sickly blue tone of skin pulled tightly into his ribs, places where there wasn&#39;t enough flesh to hide the yellow of his bones, and most recently damage from the explosion that had caused punctures and concussive blows to tear up even his face -- the only location that might have made him appear human.

A &#39;monster&#39;.

Yes, Gloria. That was what he was.</span></div><div class=chatlog__attachment><a href="discord_assets/image-223D9.png"> <img class=chatlog__attachment-media src="discord_assets/image-223D9.png" alt="Image attachment" title="Image: image.png (235.58 KB)" loading=lazy> </a></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104501871860777061 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104501871860777061><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 6, 2023 3:16 PM">3:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He reached for his throat... was it still intact enough for him to speak?


&quot;...  Aaa- <em>cough</em>-&quot;


... Probably not.

He was in no condition to fight anymore, his upper body too damaged to make any meaningful offensive, but his legs were functional still. Worst case he could shapeshift... but he&#39;d prefer to save his energy healing and not need to find another body to eat.

... The best thing to do would be to wait, then. No reason to recklessly start running away immediately and put a target on his back for the newly-introduced pair.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she couldn&#39;t be sure they didn&#39;t had any other reasons for stopping the fight, she needed to be consider how smart it would be to listen to them or not. Well for the time being she needed a moment to recover or at the very least get used to the pain so it doesn&#39;t get in the way too much. 

Still from seeing Hallbjorn she could find some silve linning in the fact that she had managed to inflict damage on him. Still his current sight proved her right which make her glare at him even when she needed the support of the wall to remain standing. 

Had she not in so much pain she would notice the tremble and feat in Karl&#39;s voice  which should she choose her words carefully may give her a chance to sway the newcomer to her side and destroy the monster but sadly and for Hallbjorn luck she wasn&#39;t aware and even now she kept some reservations and guard towards Karl.

Had a bit of a tongue on him, and a smooth yet powerful voice in contrast to his monstrous, damaged appearance.

Though, objectively speaking, it was difficult to think about what <em>other</em> response would have been appropriate, considering the scene in front of Gloria. It wasn&#39;t at all natural to see a humanoid figure feasting on another, not to mention that same humanoid figure get up from getting shot without a single care in the world.

The fact that Hallbjorn was able to stand up period after that explosion and that burst of flames made it transparently clear, if not already, that he was no human.

Monster.
Undead.
Immortal.
<em>Something</em> Unnatural.


&quot;But let us entertain that narrative. The &#39;Gunslinger Eradicates the Unholy&#39;. You must enjoy the sound of that, don&#39;t you? How <em>heroic</em> and <em>noble</em>.&quot;


Regardless of how &#39;objectively speaking&#39; it was for Gloria&#39;s response to be appropriate...

Hallbjorn would voice his displeasure nonetheless.

... Though, it&#39;d be rude to send that displeasure towards the new party, even if they caused much of the damage Hallbjorn was showing now.


&quot;... My name is unimportant, forgotten by the wind that blew in an era long gone. Who <em>I</em> am matters little, though as you can see if your concern was that &#39;no one got hurt&#39; you may be disappointed.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Shut up&quot; she finally said as she couldn&#39;t  hold her tongue any longer. &quot;What about your narrative. killing and eating a poor victim which had no business with this war. You are not only a despicable but also a coward that you cant even try to seek for a fair fight?&quot;

She turned to Liam. &quot;As much as I dislike agreeing with that, I dont think this can end without people getting hurt. He may be one of the killers who had been causing trouble so I am not leaving till I take care of him&quot;

To a degree she knew she was being unreasonable but at the same time she needed to figure out where Liam stand in this whole situation. His words and intent seem naive but to a degree they lined up with Gloria&#39;s. To deal with the being in front of them would make people not die. It was an easy connection to make but right now she lacked the patience to try and convince him.

&quot;If you arent gonna help just stay out of my way&quot; she said as she move away from the wall ready to continue dealing with Hallbjorn.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He felt relieved a bright smile covering his face and his eyes shining like this if a child on Christmas Eve. The boy could feel the sheer pressure he was under, the Magi that surrounded him were stringer than him, more trained and experienced than him. For them, in Karl’s eyes, the War was the single most important event of their life. Was that true? He was uncertain, but felt that it was an ideal assumption</em>

<em>Gloria’s remarks made him feel uneasy. It was rather rude, though her words made him feel even worse. His stomach began to turn, manslaughter it was a disgusting thing to do, but to Hallbjorn it seemed like an everyday activity. On the other hand, he reacted to Hallbjorn’s response about the importance of a name</em>

“Every name is important, you are wrong to thing that you will be forgotten. We never know what destiny awaits for us, our fellow Servant, when they were amongst the living they never assumed their name would come to have such a significance. They probably thought it would be forgotten with the passage of time too. Therefore, I yet again politely will ask for your name, Mister!”

<em>Though the words were pronounced with seriousness, his kind and goofy demeanour was still visible on his face. As, with calm and gentle eyes he looked at the grotesque and wounded body of Hallbjorn. It reminded him of a depiction of Jesus they had studied in arts class, something which caused disgust but at the same time held such a divine beauty within. This image was cut short by Gloria’s remarks.
It made sense for here to be distrustful towards Karl. After all, he came out of nowhere and caused her to be hurt to some degree. Thus, he knew where her remark came for and what a proper answer to it need be.</em>

“I’m here to help neither side. From what I heard from you, miss. Ignis, I know where that hatred and despise come from. Taking the lives of other is the worst sin one could commit.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1107025822344290455 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1107025822344290455><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, May 13, 2023 2:25 PM">2:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“…But at the same time we need to hear from Mister’s perspective.

But please, calm down and let us listen to him.”

<em>He tried to stop Gloria from doing anything by grabbing her arm and wanting to pull her closer to him, in an attempt to stop her from moving towards Hallbjorn. This is probably not the smartest move he has done and might cause the scenario to aggravate</em>

“Now, Mister. Will you be willing to explain to us what was happening prior to your encounter? Then, I can make a stand if you so wish.”

Evidence seemed to incriminate him no matter how you looked at it.

But... maybe there was something worth trying. 

Hallbjorn made his way to the body, mutilated and ripped apart it already was from his feeding... and turned what was left using his foot. Something, something... yeah, that should be enough.


&quot;I can&#39;t give wounds like this.&quot;


A completely shattered ribcage, as if they were tackled by a bull. Whatever had killed the victim before Hallbjorn found him. Considering his small frame it was unlikely the Draugr could&#39;ve inflicted that sort of damage.

Perhaps if Hallbjorn was in his other form he could do so... but no one here needed to know about that.


&quot;It was no more than a corpse when I found it. I took the opportunity to recuperate my energy. I doubt the killer could&#39;ve gotten very far, if you&#39;re really concerned about avenging them.&quot;


Admitting to what to their understanding was cannibalism wasn&#39;t... <em>that</em> much better, but at least he wasn&#39;t a murderer. At least, not as far as they knew.

Not entirely convincing words coming from a monster... but that was a decision they were to make.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had stopped walking towards him as Karl spoke to her. She still had her doubts about him and his servant but unlike the other she had no reason try attack first. Besides, she wanted to keep her focus on Hallbjorn as he could use any distraction to run away. 

Yet, Karl was really taking his chances grabbing her arm. She was considering just shooting his hand off and deal with whatever fallout but his words touch something in her. They were noble but also naive, in her eyes Karl was not different from an ignorant child who didn&#39;t knew how rotten the world truly could be. That makes her think about her kid back home, just like Karl he would eventually discover the darkness of it. Whenever she succeed or fail there was no protecting him of that. Which is why for a moment she stood still as she wondered what to say as breaking such naive notion or just let him keep it. 

That pause is what allowed Hallbjorn to spoke and brought confusion to Gloria. Should she believe him?  It sounded all too  convenient and even if it was true that didn&#39;t make him any less of a treat. Sure so far he was just taking advantage but how long till he needed to do the killing in order to survive. 

Yet on the other side if he was saying the truth she was losing precious time and clues that may help her find the killer. But regardless the unannounced party was gonna be a problem.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1108596401434267688 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1108596401434267688><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, May 17, 2023 10:26 PM">10:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Make a stand?&quot; she said with a dry laugh getting tired of this discussion as she looked at Karl. &quot;So what do you suggest?

She knew that she may be acting too harsh on the boy but on a way she was looking after him. He wouldn&#39;t survive with shallow and naive ideals like that. 

&quot;This is a war, only one can win even if he is telling the truth he is another master who wishes to obtain the same prize.&quot;  she pulled her arm away from his grasp and put some feet away. &quot;Even if he is telling the truth he is a treat that would be easier to deal right now than later.

Yet even if that wasn&#39;t his intention Karl stopping her had given Hallbjorn the chance to finish recovering from the damage from the previous explotion. The situation had changed once again, Gloria was now faced with the possibility of having to take on both of them. 

To be fair the possibility had always been there but she still had a chance were she able to take the chance while Hallbjorn was still wounded. 

Why had she decided to lose time talking with the kid was beyond her. No, she knew why but it was easier to try and pretend she didn&#39;t. 

Should she risk it?

She could but the real killer may get away, hell he may have gotten away already. No matter how she tried to think about this there wasn&#39;t really a good outcome. Even if she managed to take them down she wouldn&#39;t make it unscathed making her easy prey for anyone else. 

&quot;Fine, we are leaving&quot; she said as she put her guns away before giving a look at Hallbjorn. 

She didn&#39;tt not really believed him but right now this was the best course of action if she wanted to keep herself in the race. 

She threw a card towards Karl. 

&quot;Lets pretend I believe that thing&quot; she said looking at Hallbjorn. &quot;That means I cant lose my time here but in exchange keep me informed if your find more corpses like this my number is in the card.&quot;

She didn&#39;t wait for anyone to answer and so she and Saber began to walk away.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
