While she had a better idea of the war compared to when she summoned Saber things had gone worse. This war was not the usual 7  pairs royale battle Ritcher had told her but  instead ... actually it was hard to know how many pairs they were. 

To make things even worse, the murder cases around them hasn&#39;t stopped either.  Thinking about it rationally it was impossible to not be stressed about the whole situation but right now there was little to nothing that she could do. 

&quot;Ugh... &quot; was all she could say as she tried to avoid having a headache. Which actually brough her to the present as she found herself just walking through the streets alongside saber, 

&quot;Thinking about it. what did you say you needed now?&quot; she asked aiming to keep her mind busy with something else. While she expected Saber idea to be a silly she clinged to the small hope there was something he actually needed for the sake of the war and winning.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There were more Servants just like him, more Sabers, potentially more of everyone. Only the almighty can tell how many are participating in the war exactly.

While the objective remains the same as always, it&#39;s going to be a tedious process now... but <em>Saber has an idea</em>. That idea can be explained later, but, to Saber, he knows it is a &quot;really good one&quot;. Well, it has to be lest they get eliminated too early

...Hm?

 &quot;Right, what do I need? Hmm...&quot;

What was it? Saber has always been fascinated about this one thing, how effective it is and how powerful it is. It can cover lots of space in the blink of an eye, it deals a powerful blow upon impact, and it is as simple to use as a kitchen knife.

Oh yes. <em>That</em>.

 &quot;Master, if we are able to, I&#39;d like to own one of those fancy &quot;firearms&quot; people have nowadays.&quot;

Saber likes the idea of guns. Incredible speed and power as the products of work as effortless as pulling a little lever with your finger. Anyone can use it, though not everyone can be a master at it, especially if they aren&#39;t specializing in the way of blowing one&#39;s head off their shoulders.

 &quot;Speaking of needs, I believe you could use this opportunity to your benefit as well, Master.&quot;

She wanted to keep an open mind but knowing him she expected to ask for something that they really didn&#39;t need but that has taken his fancy. Which was not bad per se, going into different stores would help them to mingle a bit and keep a low profile posing as tourists. 

Yet his request make her stop and look at him with wide eyes. He had definately take her by surprise with this request, in complete honesty she was sure she would have never guesses that was what Saber wanted. Her first instinct was to tell him no but she resisted that impulse for 2 reasons. 

The first, she was sure Saber wouldn&#39;t just give up with a straight no if she wanted him to give she needed some more information and the second was that a gun was something they could use. Well not guns per se, she had her own but having some extra ammo or at least learning where she could get more if she were to need to buy them was quite important information. 

&quot;That is a really sudden request&quot; she said as she began to consider how possible it would be for her to get him a gun. She could get one for him in regular store under her name but in order to avoid any paperwork going for a black market seller would be faster. 

&quot;I could use some more ammo....&quot; she said as she tried to keep a neutral tone to keep Saber for thinking he had convinced her right away. It was a bad idea to just go along with his request without any sort of resistance. &quot;...but why you want it? Are guns even effective against servants??&quot;&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber won&#39;t be asking for something if he can&#39;t make any use of it. If anything, he&#39;s looking to gain an edge over the competition. Saber must do what it takes to be a step ahead of the rest, even if the advantage would only last for only seconds.

 &quot;They&#39;ll never see it coming&quot;, Saber said, giggling.

 &quot;In all seriousness, I could really use some more tools to... <em>change up my approach</em>.
—It is to keep my capabilities ambiguous to potential spectators, you see, Master.&quot;

It is clear that Saber plans on using a firearm as one of his many tricks up his sleeve. However, how he <em>exactly</em> plans on using it is still ambiguous. Perhaps he&#39;ll come up with a more practical use for it later on.

 &quot;Master, don&#39;t you think you should... um, put on some more protective wear?  Your legs and arms are exposed, your mystic cape can only do so much.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still even if that was the case Saber did made a fair point in how useful getting him a gun would be. 

That being said getting him a gun still had its own share of issues besides its utility. She knew how dangerous they could be and while she could trust Saber restrain and to not fool around with it there were other issues. Getting Saber a gun meant they had to be alert towards policemen as if they were to be asked about license or other papers there was no way Saber could produce them. Sure they could easily escape them but it would draw attention to them. 

Gloria had to calculate if the risk equal the reward, but as she was thinking about this Saber make a fair point about needing her to get some more protective gear. 

&quot;You may have a point&quot; she said as she looked around, the craziness of this war had make her forget about how she needed something more to keep the cold away. She could keep her warm with her flames and the such but she was aware of how much of a waste was that specially with a more easy solution. 

While part of her find it weird for Saber to make a solid and logic on them needing to do some shopping she couldn&#39;t deny that it was neccesary.

&quot;Alright..&quot; she said with a sigh. &quot;...I will do some calls and try to find a place were I can buy you one&quot; 

She pulled a number from her purse as she looked for a place to make a call. &quot;We may end up going to a shady place so be ready&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A gun is just one thing however, Saber is thinking that he and Gloria could use a bit more. There is only so much they could do individually and as a pair. Maybe it is wise to strap on some gear that enables options they were unable to take before.

 &quot;Anyways, it&#39;s a good time to get an upgrade as a team, don&#39;t you think, Master?&quot;

With the number of participants in the war being at least more than 7, it is better to have tools that allow them to handle potential third parties that would enable a clean escape, allow them to endure stress for longer, and other similar ideas.

Through her diligence Gloria had found a more simple and even elegant solution. They didn&#39;t need to find a shady or black market store, just find a vendor who didn&#39;t mind selling while ignoring the paperwork. Which was a bit hard without knowing the layout of the zone, as just asking any vendor could mean trouble as while not likely it was still possible they a weapons seller with values. 

&quot;Well just have a look and pick your fancy&quot; she said as she looked around in the store. As useful as Ritcher was when it came to information there were areas which were beyond his reach. Hopefully, she her many travels had given her more contacts besides Ritcher. 

It was a bit weird but this was her first time in a gun shop, at least a legit one. Sure she had gone through the proper procedures for her mystic code but they were a nice fit for her that she really haven&#39;t looked for more guns and she didn&#39;t pretend to. 

But this store had some more stuff than just guns and ammo, it also has some clothes. It wasn&#39;t nothing fancy as protective armor or anything of the such but it suit her better. Regular clothes wouldn&#39;t cut it, she needed something which let her move well and fast even if it lacked protection. 

&quot;Do you know anything about guns?&quot; she asked quite curious of how much knowledge Saber had. &quot;Im no expert but I can give you some pointers.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Walking around, Saber examines a variety of firearms. He initially took an interest in what seems to be a shotgun, but he realized he would prefer it to be easily concealed, same goes for the rifles. Handguns, they&#39;re pretty small and may be just what Saber is looking for.

 &quot;Master, I&#39;ll take this one.&quot;

Saber called and pointed at a handgun he has taken a liking to. The label on the gun refers to it as the &quot;Colt M1911&quot;. While he does not know anything about guns, he has a good feeling about this one that he chose.

 &quot;I don&#39;t know what a cartridge exactly is, but it has the biggest number out of the rest. Must be pretty good, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

.45 ACP, it says. Saber thinks it refers to the power of the bullet. The bigger the number, the better the power, Saber thought.

She didn&#39;t even tried to hide her expectations, while she knew this was a necessity she did expect Saber to try and plea his case to convince her to get him a high caliber gun or something flashy for the sake of looking cool or maybe due to a simple correlation between bigger being better. The fact that he went beyond her expectations was actually a nice surprise, 

&quot;Seeing as you use a sword, a light gun like that would actually work quite well&quot; she said as she pulled her own. While it was easy to see the gun had seen it fair share of use it looked clean and in good condition. While they were a bit different in in the length of the barrel and the X sign on the side they were quite similar

&quot;I guess we match now&quot;  she said with a small smile as she allowed herself to relax as she pulled what she had picked. &quot;Oh I got some nice pants and long sleeves turtle necks, they don&#39;t offer much  protection but should help with the cold and they seem easy to move.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber looks so full of himself as he crossed his arms and smirked in pride. He&#39;s not exactly wrong however, the first thing he had requested from Gloria was a belt to carry his sword around. Though those &quot;flashy&quot; and &quot;overboard&quot; things were definitely unnecessary, if not risky, that&#39;s for sure.

 &quot;I must say, you look stunning in those.
—To me at least.&quot;

Saber doesn&#39;t exactly have a mainstream taste in fashion, but his comment is definitely genuine. He definitely prefers more familiar garments, but all is fine in foreign trends.

 &quot;You know, this reminds me of the time where someone from my family used to give me gifts.&quot;

It is implied that, in life, Saber used to receive gifts from a special someone from his family. To give him support in his travels, they gifted Saber a variety of things. At first, they may seem unrelated to Saber&#39;s quest but, most likely because of fate, Saber managed to make good use out of what he was given.

It is because of the acts of his family, he managed to develop a skill that allows him to, somehow, make do of the situation he gets himself in. One could say, he developed a <em>Creative Ingenuity</em>.

 &quot;What about you, Master? Do you get gifts from your family too?&quot; ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well he wasn&#39;t exactly wrong, in her eyes he was exaggerating his words but that didn&#39;t really make it lie or false.  

But then Saber pay her a compliment, it was something she didn&#39;t saw coming and for a moment she found herself without knowing what to say. Who would have though her servant could be thoughtful 

&quot;Well thanks&quot; her answer was mostly polite but there was some sincerity in her words. It has been a while since she had been given a compliment based on her appearance. It wasn&#39;t like her family or friends consider her ugly or anything of the sort but she had been traveling so almost non stop for the last few years  barely being home to check on her kid. So the opportunity didn&#39;t really present itself. 

That make her think about them, they were always present in her mind but she usually avoid thinking too hard about them as she would end up getting worried and right now she couldn&#39;t afford to be concerned about other things besides their enemies.

&quot;Well depends on how you look at it, my guns and  cape are a gift from my clan but...&quot; if she were to think of something that her sibling or parent directly gave her, there wasn&#39;t anything special. &quot;... its hard to say, they haven&#39;t given me gifts but they had given me other things that I carry with me all the time.&quot; 

She began to look around, maybe she should take chance of this small break and get something from them. &quot;But maybe I should take the chance and get something from them.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If Gloria does not think of what she&#39;s been given for daily use as a gift, this is one way to know if what&#39;s being given is a gift. If the giver cared enough to listen to the receiver&#39;s wishes, one could consider it a gift. Similar to the idea of Santa Claus caring to follow a young kid&#39;s wish list and giving them what they wish for as a gift.

For Saber, he does not exactly mind the intent of the giver and the content of the given. He will be grateful for the one who gave him something, whether as a loving gift or as a necessity, mostly out of tradition and occasionally genuinely grateful.

But is not like Gloria minded at all, Saber was a resource to a degree for her. Even if the grail failed in granting her wish having Saber around in her village should help them gain some more time. 

Even without that, it was nice to be able to talk about her family without needing to keep in mind what she said. Even someone like her who lacked magus etiquette knew how dangerous was to talk about one family&#39;s with another magus. The main reason the Ignis had been able to keep a somewhat pacific existence was due to their secluded existence. So the less people who knew about them the better, so whenever she worked with anyone Gloria always had to be careful to not give them any hints about her clan.

&quot;Also back to where you were saying, my guns and cape I think they fit the description of family heirlooms more than gifts. If possible I wish I could pass them to my kid or my nephews if possible.&quot; While she said that part of her wished her kid had no need for such tools to begin with. 

&quot;I think that is similar to what your family member gift ya. If it was something that passed through different generations it would be a heirloom.

To inherit a family heirloom, for Saber, means that one was trusted with handling a symbol of their bloodline&#39;s legacy. If that is not worthy of being seen as a gift, then Saber does not know what else is. It would be a different story if it was given in a way that made it seem &quot;disposable&quot;, but that idea is rather unlikely for something dubbed as a family heirloom.

?!

Ahaha. What did Saber in life receive as a gift? What a interesting question with equally interesting answers. Saber went silent for a bit before giving a rather embarrassed expression on his face.

 &quot;Well, what did I get from my family, huh.&quot;

Should Saber be honest? Lie to make himself look good? Hmm, the choices, the choices. Perhaps it is more fun this way, Saber thought.

 &quot;I used to have a dress, some fire starters, and then, something I have on me right now, <em>this</em>.&quot;

Saber gestured to his sword, indicating it is inherited from his family. Despite his attempts to push it away, he could not help but chuckle a bit at the implication that he once wore a dress in his life. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was more akin to seeing him at what seemed at a loss of words, if she were to try and analyze the pause the young man did it would look as if his servant just like herself wasn&#39;t expecting the question. 

Gloria ignored some of the details of how summons worked. For better or worse she had summoned a servant that at its core was similar to her to a certain degree so being a bit similar in some aspects was expected. 

Still she didn&#39;t pay much attention to it and insteas she focused on the list Saber gave her of stuff he had inherit or as he called it recieved as a gift from his family. the list was quite varied and quite the surprise for Gloria. She was well aware that Saber had lied about his identity and while she knew he wouldn&#39;t  know it for a while she though maybe she could obtain a small clue or something. 

Yet from that unique list, nothing came to her mind. 

&quot;wait...&quot; she said as she realize that there was something which doesn&#39;t fit when compared to the rest. &quot;Why would your family gift you a dress??&quot;

Honestly with his face she didn&#39;t find it hard to believe that Saber had cross-dress at some point but she assumed it was due to him messing around or trying to take advantage of a situation. But if his family gave him a dress does that meant it was more of a habit for him to cross dress?

&quot;Do you liked wearing dresses that much?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Saber said, still awkwardly laughing from how &quot;out there&quot; the dress is among the list of gifts given to Saber by his family. It wasn&#39;t long until he regained his composure, though it is clear it has not left his mind at all judging from his light smile.

 &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll tell you about it, Master. Though I would prefer to talk about it in a more... private place.&quot;

He looked around as if someone was watching them, there was none that did so. Saber has been like this since the day of his summoning, always refraining from revealing his true identity. Claiming the walls have eyes and ears, the wind carrying the words he spouted from his mouth, and all the little sense of paranoia Saber exhibits.

It is established by Saber since the start that he prefers not to reveal much about himself. Perhaps his identity being revealed could potentially be detrimental to their success, potentially taking him or even both of them out of the war in the process. Whatever it is, Saber will continue to keep his identity a secret to everyone, even Gloria, <em>unless he has no choice</em>.

 &quot;You have any fancy blinding and deafening magic on you? That&#39;ll do just the trick, otherwise just don&#39;t mind it.&quot; ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

As she understood that while information was important there was limit to how much they can hide specially with so many participants. That didn&#39;t mean she was being laidback about but it was more akin to her understanding that no matter what all she could do was to be as careful as possible. 

&quot;So guess I wont mind, is not that big of a deal honestly. In fact is less of a surprise and more just curiosity about your family&quot;  There was no lies in her words. While it fit Saber personality getting used to that was not something easy to get used to. That makes her wonder how much of Saber mentality and way to be had been a product of his raising and how much it was his own individuality.

While its true we are molded by our environment as a person picks habit and ways to act from those around him. But at the same time one is its own person and due to one own personality some of the things one could just pick he just doesn&#39;t. 

&quot;Well as you aren&#39;t gonna tell me anytime soon you may as well help me find something for my kid&quot; through their conversation they had already left the gun store and Gloria had made her way to a toy store. &quot;You are a boy just like my son so maybe you will notice something I could miss&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>
