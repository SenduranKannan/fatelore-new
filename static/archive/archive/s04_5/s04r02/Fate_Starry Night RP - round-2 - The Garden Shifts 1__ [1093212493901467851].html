He couldn&#39;t determine what expressions the bodies of the victims made. Nonetheless, he could taste the salt in the air. Tears.

Nightmares.

He was alone in the dark. A vast expanse of nothing but bodies. An open field of shadow was unnerving to anyone, as nobody knew what existed in the shadows beyond where one stood. Many people thought that it was far worse to be stuck in a dark box. Confined, squeezing out each breath with the threat of running out of air.

That was nothing compared to an infinite field with an unknown number of nightmares prowling in the dark. The mind did the work that reality did not.

&quot;A nightmare, then. That&#39;s fine.&quot; Illyn took a seat on a body&#39;s chest. It was fine. He was fine. There was nothing wrong with sitting out in the dark. He wouldn&#39;t break under some paltry dream. Illyn was a logical thinker, he did everything with utmost rationality. A magus was a symbol of logic. A genius, even more so.

He would not break.

Yes you will. 

&quot;No I won&#39;t.&quot; Illyn sighed as he leaned forward.

Yesssssssssssss</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093212684406771733 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093212684406771733><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 11:36 AM">11:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Nope.&quot; Illyn leaned forward. He had this dream every night. After ten years, it should have gotten boring. Yet here Illyn was, discussing if his mind was intact with a voice that sounded a lot like his own.

He wanted to smash his head into the ground and scream. Even as he calmly argued with himself, Illyn&#39;s mind was running haywire. A logical paradox that did not make sense. Then again, Illyn himself didn&#39;t make much sense. Despite being in this field, he never bothered to determine what this field consisted of.

Logic would dictate all of his victims belonged here, yet they never revealed themselves. The dream was always static, so Illyn repeated it. For once, he elected to change it through his own will.

He looked up, and saw a wheel. It began to turn and glow brightly. It became a sun.

Illyn looked down again, and saw a field of Illyns. Hundreds of them. A vacant expression filled their gaze as they all stared at him. They slowly rose to their feet, and began to rush towards him.

Illyn.

Before he could scream, Illyn woke up yelling. His hand was outstretched towards the ceiling. A nightmare. The nightmare. There was nothing to be concerned about.

&quot;Rider, to me.&quot; Illyn sighed as sunlight flickered onto his face as it rose past the window.

The mango groves were nothing short of an eden he had been enamored with, but even that was not enough to keep his attention fully. No. . . he wanted to see how exactly the city of Bernice had been like.

The rider had kept his little excursion to himself, though he truly felt it was not something that needed much of elabroation anyways. While his master slept, he would simply visit the bazaars here, surely he could see what they ate in this place. Something to get a description of the people here--

But when he was ready to get himself ready to head out into the world, he could hear the words in his head ring, no matter how far the two were, he could hear his master&#39;s command. <em>To him</em>. It hadn&#39;t been much of a debate, rather he reverted to his spirit form, and before Illyn could question where his servant was, Kalki appeared on the foot of his bed.

&quot;You look like you&#39;ve fought several wars, Master. I assume the darkness is not your friend?&quot;

His words were both concerned and yet it seemed to hold a slight hint of amusement, as if he were entertained at the idea of what his master could have suffered over. Kalki rose a brow, keeping his gaze over the man as he gathred himself together. 

&quot;Do you often wake up yelling?&quot;

Illyn wasn&#39;t sure how his Servant could be so casual about life. Especially when his summoning was to fight in a bloody war that would likely end in his extermination. There were only two types of people who accepted reality in this manner: savants and fools.

Which one did Sri Kalki belong to?

&quot;Yes. Get used to it.&quot; Illyn motioned as he leaned forward. He didn&#39;t even rub the sleep from his eyes. &quot;I relive my failures often. One day, you&#39;ll do the same when you have things to fail. Whenever you&#39;re actually born, that is.&quot;

Illyn warmed up slightly to Kalki after returning the artifact to the museum. He was a whiz at driving. That, at least, warranted respect. He did not hate Kalki, but he would never forgive his Servant for his crime at daring to appear in this world.

&quot;Toast. Get to it.&quot; Illyn waved at his Servant as if he were a butler. &quot;Radio.&quot; With another wave, a radio somewhere in the house clicked to life.

<em>As mysteriously as they appeared, rare artifacts stolen from the Museum of Cairo have reappeared suddenly on the steps of the institution. Authorities are baffled, but relieved at their return.</em>

<em>In other news, several dead bodies have been discovered in Benerice, spiking the town&#39;s murder count higher than it has been since the Great Alligator Incident of 1986...</em>

&quot;Shit.&quot; Illyn said, his expression as unreadable as ever. &quot;They&#39;re sloppy.&quot; He said vaguely as he quickly got dressed in a button up shirt and khakis.

&quot;Toast, Rider.&quot; Illyn repeated as he prepared to leave the bedroom.

The servant pushed himself off the edge of the man&#39;s bed, turning his head towards the sun that filtered through his window.

&quot;Ah, we&#39;ll I can&#39;t really fail then, especially if I wish to follow Lord Vishnu&#39;s orders. I cannot allow for the world to not experience its first of many cycles it will experience. That&#39;s enough pressure as it is. . .&quot;

He spoke as if he had not even registered the man&#39;s sharp response earlier or now,  the command that had come completely from left field. In fact, he easily brushed it off for the moment, giving it to the random excuse of him being awake due to that nightmare he seemed to have.

&quot;Toast? I hope you have the spices for it. . . surely I can make you a nice toast to enjoy.&quot;

He had stood there for a moment, pondering if they even had the spices his homeland had carried. A toast was easy, but getting the flavors right when he had hardly gotten to know Bernice at all was the difficult part. It was not until he had to hear Illyn&#39;s command again that he truly got a move on it, leaving to go to the kitchen to get a start on it. 

. . .

After a moment of getting ready, Illyn would at least have some sort of breakfast. The bread toasted to a nice degree, and in the middle was a nice amount of mango jam, powdered in what looked like a red seasoning. On the side, a cup of milk. 

&quot;I tried to use what I could, though I can see that there is a big difference is spices that I could use. But toast you wanted, toast you have, Master. Now, while I would ask when you were not eating, I should ask what the agenda is. Surely you don&#39;t plan on waiting inside this place, you wouldn&#39;t have done that to poor Anubis, now would you?&quot;

He looked up at the mirror as he splashed water into his eyes. Same expression, same gaze. Yet something flickered in them. Annoyance. This Grail War had just barely begun, and things had already gone awry.

His motivation had changed.  Without Anubis, he needed the Holy Grail. IBM was a long way away from recreating her. He would chase after that dream for eternity. The grail would break the wheel. It had to.

If it came to it, he would line the road with as many corpses as needed to make his dream a reality. Even his Servant&#39;s.

With that, he went out to face Rider. Scents assaulted his nose, smelling positively exotic. Illyn instinctively made a face at the scent as Kalki beamed at him. Illyn&#39;s expression twisted into a small smile.

&quot;The milk is extra. It was not requested.&quot; Illyn told his Servant as he sat down.  He looked at the cup. &quot;Yet it is appreciated. Extra effort should be rewarded.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093226869781966848 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093226869781966848><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 12:33 PM">12:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He took a sip. Illyn couldn&#39;t taste anything, but the cool sensation was pleasant after sleeping. Illyn tapped the table in a mechanical rhythm as he drained the cup. &quot;The other Masters are here, Rider. Worse, they are sloppy.&quot; Illyn&#39;s tone adopted the disdain that Kalki was so familiar with. Yet this time, it was directed at their foes. &quot;I have been wandering the world for years, and I have not drummed up this much attention in ten years then what has been announced in the past week.&quot;

Illyn set the cup down.

&quot;My little stars have not alerted me to anything substantial. That is, nothing that we don&#39;t already know from the radio. We will drive around Benerice and poke around the leylines in the area. Magi will build workshops near them. Furthermore, I suspect that the Holy Grail will appear near one of these leylines. It is a powerful magical artifact. I suspect it will take all the help it can get to appear.&quot;

&quot;Therefore, we must gather intelligence.&quot; Illyn took a bite of taste, expecting the typical tastelessness that he related to food. Instead, spice filled his mouth. &quot;<strong>Ack!</strong>&quot; Illyn choked as he leaned forward. A genuine look of shock filled his face.

&quot;<strong>What did you do to my toast, Rider!</strong>&quot; Illyn pointed at his Servant. &quot;Why can I taste it?&quot; Illyn said crossly, taking another bite all the same.&quot;

Kalki was kept his smile, almost as if he were humble enough to shrug off such a compliment like an oversized coat. It didn&#39;t fit him. But clearly, with how his words were, he wore it anyways. He waited for Illyn to give him a response about his semi-jest of sermoning, yet got none. Instead, he went on about the war.

&quot;I am not surprised if other masters are here, a war is something that is not fought with one person. But, you sound like you&#39;ve met some.  Do go on.&quot;

The rider took a bite of his toast, trying to keep his attention on the man&#39;s inferences on where and where not the holy grail would appear, brushing out what could be the itinerary that they would have set for the day. So it would be exploring the leylines. . . That, could be interesting. But what truly interested him, was the idea of one day getting the chance to come across these &quot;sloppy&quot; masters that Illyn clearly disliked. He couldn&#39;t say he was not getting antsy with anticipation. 

<em><strong>ACK</strong></em>

The smile broadened on Kalki&#39;s face. So he <em>could</em> enjoy the flavor of things. His exclamation only was responded with a laughter, a hearty one thicker and more rich than the mango and ginger shaving jelly he added to the man&#39;s toast. The mixture of sweet and spice was enough to make the man take another bite. 

&quot;Ah, I forgot to ask, you are not allergic to ginger are you? Or a bit of pepper flakes? The sweetness of your toast is definitely something that could be enhanced with a few ingredients, I love it. Another, take another!&quot;

Kalki slid slice of his toast the man&#39;s direction, he being bold enough to take a slice for himself as well. 

&quot;You must hurry, who knows when such good meals could always last. The wheel turns consistently, and so we must always embrace what he have at the moment.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093412226913800233 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093412226913800233><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 12:49 AM">12:49 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote"><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-border"></div><div class="chatlog__markdown-quote-content"><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></div></div></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think and automatically assume others know what I&#39;m talking about. You are here to bring my wife back. That is your purpose. As for my wish for the Holy Grail...&quot;

Illyn trailed off and took another bite of toast. He was silent for a spell as the radio droned on with an irrelevant talk show. &quot;This is the first thing I&#39;ve been able to taste in a very long time.&quot; The amount of spice was excessive. An ordinary person would likely vomit. Nonetheless, Illyn appreciated the sensation. &quot;I have not met a single other Master in this war. But they are mediocre. Likely freelancers and Clock Tower laggards. The fact that we can hear it on the radio is proof of that.&quot;

As Kalki ate his toast, Illyn noted that his Servant was seemingly unaffected. Servants were truly a different breed. Illyn ate in solace with his Servant in quiet company.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093592305224663171 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093592305224663171><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 12:45 PM">12:45 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Quiet.&quot; 

&quot;Another?&quot; A silent moan left Illyn&#39;s mouth. Toast was good. Kalki&#39;s toast was better. Yet Illyn was not acclimated to eating food with taste, even if that taste was an explosion of spices in his mouth. &quot;You are correct. The wheel could turn. My oven could explode. A car could crash through that window. You could magically collapse under the weight of your own power. Anything could happen. Yet the wheel still turns.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s frustrating.&quot;

Illyn stood up. &quot;Let&#39;s get ready. I have a few locations to scout out. You will drive, Rider.&quot;

That was an interesting take. Was his master just against being seen? That could have been a point he could have been trying to make. . . He nodded at the thought. Okay.  Illyn continued on, Kalki eating his way through the discussion, till he got to the idea of Kalki bringing his wife back. Back? He tried to play ignorant, lying to himself that by bringing her back he meant from like an airport, <em>whatever that is</em>, but knew exactly how serious his master was. Ah, so Anubis was going to have her rise from the dead. . . But did he not know everything came with a cost of it? No servant could completely reanimate the dead, the god surely would fully allow such a thing. . . And yet, now the responsibility was passed down to him. But to bring her back would have upset the wheel, and he was sure that Illyn knew that as well.

He tried to keep his comments to himself, theories that weren’t proven were nothing but useless at this moment. He couldn’t say that he just wouldn’t do so either, god knew what Illyn’s outburst could have been like had he blatantly refused. It’d take persuasion, trying to help cope, but he was sure he’d come to realize it soon enough. But for now, he simply nodded along, his once proud smile however faltered into one of pity, though he was once again sure, the man would be ignorant to such a difference.

“I’m glad you enjoy it then, Master. While I know that I brag on my country repeatedly, I must say that I believe that we hold the reigning rulers of spices. If you ever need another tip on how to taste such a thing again, do not hesitate to ask.” 

His master put up with his goading for more food, followed with the idea for how he thought the wheel work. The random scenarios were brutal, and, while he couldn’t help alleviate such a thought, he couldn’t help but be glad he understood it. However, for every negative Illyn would say, he would mentally counteract it with one good thing.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093909565243936789 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093909565243936789><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 9:46 AM">9:46 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Money could be found on the floor, a person could be resuscitated had they been passed out, a mother could have given birth new healthy newborns. These were things the wheel did and yet it continued to spin, ignorant to the pleas of the world. And yet, the man had not said anything of that. No one did.

“You are correct, that the wheel would keep spinning, good and bad karma works in two ways, and while I see you are upset for it, it could be a moment to reflect on your life. The wheel may not respond to your prayers, but that doesn’t mean the universe doesn’t either.”

And with that, he scooted his chair back, taking his plate and cup with him to the counter and dropped it in there. It was time to go out, Illyn had said. He would be able to drive again, and that was all he needed to hear for an excuse to stand and move about. Without a glance towards his master, and his brows knit together in thought, he could only ask.

“Ah, where to then, Illyn.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
