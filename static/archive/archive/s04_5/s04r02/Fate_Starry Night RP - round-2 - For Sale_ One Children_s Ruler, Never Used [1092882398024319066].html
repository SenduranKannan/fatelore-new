In death, books were still the residing place of mankind&#39;s knowledge.  More could be gained from the written word than hearing it from the source in some ways, once you were learned and knew how to crack open the text like an egg - inferring intent, dismissing intent and understanding the work as it best fits together, a broken eggshell being put back in a way that is not the &#39;correct&#39; fashion, but is the most &#39;beautiful&#39; way.

This roundabout metaphor was how Assassin was going about learning the truth of the modern world.  The modern <em>soul.</em>

&#39;Twas melodramatic, yes, but would you ever fault her for that?  It was the essence of her being, to deny her to act like a pompous idiot was to kill her.  Besides, it&#39;s not like the people of today liked their literature any less pompous or idiotic.

Many things had occurred during her and the Master&#39;s impromptu trip to the department store - few of them good - but among the scenes of icy death, and the alternating thrill and fear of combat against a foe that far outstripped her in power and prowess, Assassin realized something.

People in the modern day were very opulent, weren&#39;t they?

She looked upon the stores of furniture, where long couches of leather and upholstery fit for noble houses were within the reach of the simple commoner!  The clothes made of thread that all felt perfectly smooth and bore bright colors, intricate designs!  The modern devices, made mundane to her by her divinely inspired knowledge but no less impressive.  That last part was what was driving her current interest.  Yes, it could be said that it kept her mind away from more serious matters, but she&#39;d never let that on.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092883264861118575 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092883264861118575><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 1:47 PM">1:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Much of what this store kept around was related to tourism, and she had little desire to read about the long-dead kings of Egypt for the moment.  They could keep wilting in their sarcophagi, for she had a portal to the modern soul right in front of her.  Small hands held a little manual in Arabic in one hand, and a long aerial in the other.  This television, outdated by modern standards, was just a little box the size of an especially fat chicken meant to pick up terrestrial signals.  The fact that she had it plugged in, placed on the front counter, facing the right way and turned on made her stand above many of her peers from the 16th century!  As soon as she got the damn thing to stop displaying a burst of black-and-white noise, she&#39;d be able to read <em>and see</em> the modern soul...

The door was locked but the lights were on, and for once, someone sat at the counter like they owned the place.  It&#39;s not as if they had anything good to sell, so why bother worrying?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bruises and aches were still healing from his battering with Berserker&#39;s Master. He wasn&#39;t a fighter. All he had to go off of was his short time at the Clock Tower while studying abroad there. There was his late wife who taught him self-defense techniques but, after years of not practicing them, that knowledge was pretty much pointless. 

To soothe the pains somewhat, James decided that it would be best if he stayed upstairs and rested upon the bed. Mister Fluffybuns rested on his chest. A hand was placed gently on its back to ensure it doesn&#39;t fall off. Already the thoughts of home were plaguing his mind. His daughter spent so long without him by her side. No dreams to comfort her pains. He can only hope that Walton is doing his best in his place.

&quot;So much time wasted and I&#39;m not even any closer to achieving this wish...&quot; He rambled to himself while his gaze was lost to whatever was beyond the ceiling. Doubts started to cloud his mind. Was this even the right choice to make? Did he make a mistake by coming here? Could this even work? 

Thankfully, the sounds from downstairs told him that Assassin was keeping herself busy. This allowed him some peace. Maybe she knew that and gave him his space? There wasn&#39;t any way for him to truly know if that was the case. He feared the peace will be broken should he bring it up. So, for now, he will take what he can get.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 3:15 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092905009403928757 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092905009403928757><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 3:14 PM">3:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For the briefest moment, she could hear the cheap glass doors creak open ever so slowly, accompanied by the faint ringing of bells overhead. It was a familiar sound, one that signaled the arrival of a guest.

Yet as she turned to look, the door remained firmly locked in its hinges, the metal bars barring entry to anyone outside. But the sound had been so vivid and real, as if the doors had opened themselves, even though there was no one to be seen.

A trick of the mind, perhaps? The store, cluttered with trinkets and souvenirs for tourists, has its every shelf packed to the brim. The air was stale, and the persistent static from the half-assembled TV didn&#39;t help much, either. Perhaps it&#39;d be a good idea to air out her mind as well as the store...

Or perhaps it&#39;d be better to dismiss it as a mere illusion and continue with her newfound hobby.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092925431331700876 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092925431331700876><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 4:35 PM">4:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of course, she wasn&#39;t making progress, and her...let&#39;s not call it &#39;paranoia&#39;, but more along the lines of &#39;<em>strong</em> paranoia&#39;, didn&#39;t seem to help matters.  It <em>could</em> have just been a neighbor&#39;s bell; these walls seemed thin.  However, this TV wasn&#39;t going to un-assemble itself.

But there was no sign of anyone who could have wanted to enter the store. The sky was gray, the clouds shifting in the wind, signaling an onset of rain.

Hopefully no one was planning to do laundry any time soon!

<em>clack</em>

A noise from inside the store. Hard plastic knocking on glass. A boy(?) in a plain white shirt, flannel, and old jeans rested his arms on the counter, rocking that classic 90s look. He kept prodding the mini TV with his hands, his entire head hidden underneath a large space helmet.

&#39;I&#39;d try moving the antenna around to a different location, if I were you.&#39; The boy said, his voice crystal clear in Assassin&#39;s ears despite the suffocating helmet. &#39;Simply plugging the antenna isn&#39;t enough. You need to make sure that it&#39;s placed somewhere that can receive a signal, and having a roof over its head doesn&#39;t help. But if you fix it now, you can catch Astroboy on Channel 15 in 24 minutes!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092936444743532594 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092936444743532594><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 5:19 PM">5:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She had yet to grasp modern fashion and looked out of place herself, with her doublet being wholly unfit for the desert, but this was wholly unfamiliar to her...perhaps it&#39;s just a...very modern sort of hat...

She laughed.  She tried to laugh and speak in a way that was loud enough to alert James upstairs.

&quot;Quite good news, my...boy.&quot;  She started to slowly walk back to the counter, probably displaying more caution than was necessary.  Probably.  &quot;You fancy yourself a scholar of televisions, then?&quot;

She tried to put on more of a modern flair.  &quot;I mean, a <em>wiz-kid</em> has to know his way around one if he wishes to catch all the latest hits.&quot;  Very natural, though something didn&#39;t feel natural about their guest.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

If Assassin had failed to alert James with her voice, then he would certainly be alerted now.

&#39;Sorry. I&#39;m not used to this body. Still need to adjust a bit.&#39; The kid shook his head, as if trying to shake off the disorientation. But he quickly returned his attention to Assassin as she approached. &#39;But never mind me, let&#39;s take a look at you. A jester&#39;s hat, a motley tunic, bells, tassels, leggings and gloves! You are a Servant, and an old one at that. England? France? Italy? Spain?&#39;

He peppered Assassin with questions, trying to coax more responses out of her. &#39;The Grail gave you knowledge of the modern day, but engineering is quite a specialized skill. I&#39;m surprised you can figure out this much all on your own.&#39;

He sounded genuinely impressed, and ogled openly at Assassin. Even though his face were entirely hidden behind the helmet&#39;s dark visor, Assassin could feel the weight of his scrutiny, as if she was being examined from head to toe by a scanner. His helmet tilted slightly as he made no attempt to hide his curiosity, and sized her up from all sides.

Now that they were practically at arm&#39;s length, it was easy to tell that the kid was about the same height as her. Though that oversized helmet made him tower just a few centimeters above her own hat. A slight inconvenience, surely.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1092954243293511690 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1092954243293511690><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 4, 2023 6:29 PM">6:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Something was off about it though. This wasn&#39;t some random chattering one would do to one&#39;s self. No. Was Assassin talking to someone? That can&#39;t be...

Without making as much noise as he can, James got up and placed Mister Fluffybuns down on the bed gently. He soon replaced it with one of his Silver Nails, concealing it as one would a knife. Each step afterwards was made with the upmost care. Maybe they didn&#39;t realize where James was.

The worn-out building did him no favours, slowing his pace to a crawl to avoid any creaks or noises. The place was locked and closed. There shouldn&#39;t be anybody inside the store. Even Assassin knew that! So what the hell could he hear someone downstairs with Assassin!

They sounded innocent enough. A kid&#39;s voice from the sounds of it. Well, they <em>would&#39;ve</em> if he didn&#39;t hear them mention Servants. A Master? This young? Impossible...

<em>&#39;Assassin. Were we followed?&#39;</em>

There wasn&#39;t any way around it.  Upon them was <em>someone</em> who was involved in the competition, even if he gave off an air of na&#239;ve incompetence - but then again, Assassin did as well.  Trust couldn&#39;t be meted out here, as genial as the child seemed.  Why did it have to be a child...

<em>Keep close, but be cautious in revealing yourself, Master.  One wouldn&#39;t walk so easily into our midst unless they couldn&#39;t find a sturdy rope to hang themselves with, or they had a plan in mind.</em>

There was a bright side to this all, though: if it was an enemy and there were no pretenses to hide behind, Assassin could act as flippant as the situation demanded!  No greater joy to be had, naturally, naturally.  If he was to watch her so intently, she might provide him a show of it all.  Her caution visibly disappeared, and she walked up to the counter, placing her chin on its edge as she looked right into the black void of his helmet.  

&quot;Why, I?  An engineer?  Perish the thought,&quot; she held up a hand from behind the edge and shook her head.  Straight back into antiquated talk and antics she went.  &quot;No stuffy man who hangs over paper, scrutinizing lines as a vulture does choice bits of rot.  No man flinging himself from the rafters for want of a single faulty wooden plank, no wanker of the plumb-line trying to divine the slightest grade in the stone.  I am the most hated enemy of the kings and the church - someone who can read.&quot;

She reached across the table to grab at the little pulp-paper manual the television came with, both to illustrate, and to gauge his response as she moved her hand close to his.  She was cautious, yes, but if he were to lash out, it&#39;d be a way to find out the measure of his reflexes - and by that, his origin.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093236475736371321 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093236475736371321><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 1:11 PM">1:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;&#39;tis but a matter of reading instructions in text rendered for the simplest of modern men.

&quot;As for my origin, should it be not obvious?  I am the great and mighty Roland, and this,&quot; she pulls out her little felt-headed scepter from underneath his view, &quot;is none other than Durendal, with which many Saracens have become divided.&quot;

&#39;Not an engineer,&#39; he nodded, as Assassin brandished her hand like a stop sign.
&#39;A literate of the court.&#39; He repeated, bounding after Assassin as she dodged behind the counter.
&#39;Kings and clergies hate you.&#39; He clapped politely, as Assassin made a dramatic show of presenting the TV manual like a picture book.

All the while, she had been putting on a show, but the boy had made no attempt on her life. Despite her sharp tongue and wit, he seemed unfazed, all of her sarcasm seemingly flying over his head. Throughout the spectacle, he remained a diligent listener, nodding and commenting here and there. Was he genuinely gullible, or was he simply putting on an act?

&#39;Anything else you&#39;d like to indulge me?&#39; The boy asked, seemingly smitten with her words. If he had sported a <em>tail</em>, then it would be wagging right about now. To think that she&#39;d receive a listener as well-behaved as he in the middle of a run-down souvenir shop—

<em>clack</em>

The boy suddenly tilted his head, the cheap plastic of his helmet knocking against the glass. Assassin had arrived at the crescendo of her speech: the moment when she would finally reveal her True Name.

<em>&#39;—— The great and mighty Roland.&#39;</em>

&#39;Liar.&#39;

<em>&#39;——And this, is none other than Durendal.&#39;</em>

<strong>&#39;Liar.&#39;</strong>

His stared at Assassin, fingers drumming on the glass in a steady rhythm. &#39;You&#39;re lying,&#39; he said softly, but his tone left no room for doubt, as if he were merely stating a fact. &#39;But it&#39;s a funny cover story,&#39; he continued, as if he hadn&#39;t just made an accusation. &#39;Have you tried it on your Master yet? Did he like it?&#39;

He let out a small giggle as Assassin asked for his name in return. With a flourish, he peeled himself off the counter and puffed out his chest, as if preparing for an important announcement.

<em>creak</em>

The sudden stop caused James to slip up. A bit more weight was placed into his step causing a creak to be made. Whether it was intentional from the kid or not, that call revealed his location to the two. &quot;Shit...&quot; While gritting his teeth, James spoke under his breath almost to the point of biting his own tongue. 

The Silver Nail was placed inside his belt loop. The thicker end would prevent it from slipping all the way through. Hiding a hand from sight would be too obvious after all. Time to bullshit his way out of this situation.

&quot;You know we aren&#39;t open yet. We can&#39;t really sell you anything.&quot; James came down the rest of the stairs and stopped at the last step. Upon getting a better look at him, there was no doubt that this was a <em>kid</em>. Worst yet, if they were involved in the Holy Grail War here then that meant James might have to come to terms with killing a <em>kid</em> out of all things, or allow Assassin to do so. A terrible taste ran through his mouth upon realizing that fact.

<em>&#39;Stay on your guard.

Cannot take a joke, can we?&quot;  She shook her head.  &quot;Little changes; tough crowds, no matter what end of time you&#39;re on.  I&#39;ve claimed many names, little boy, because plainly it&#39;s much funnier if I dodge the question that way.&quot;

It was plain to see that she probably wasn&#39;t a hero knight of the old Francia, given that the only thing her scepter could cut is tension, but the way the child reacted made it seem like there was some untenable breech of trust between them - some stupid fool and the home invader she was entertaining, the greatest of trusts!  He grew stranger and stranger yet, and his own claim was...similarly an obvious joke.

But you don&#39;t see Assassin acting upset about it...

She did get a bit more defensive once he called out her Master, her hand hidden behind the counter slowly making its way for a knife.  The thought alone was similarly distasteful to her; Servant or not, young or simply a stunted adult, this was too close to a child to make killing him easy, comfortable.  The tension was clear, and she winced, only for James to step forward.

Assassin would almost breath a sigh of relief when he came up with this lie.  Almost.  There were some reservations.  Immediately, she smiled in the same unpleasant, smug grin as before, and added &quot;Besides, little Neil, what would we sell you?  This isn&#39;t a store for toys or sweet things.  I doubt we&#39;d have much at all to entertain you.&quot;

<em>Master, if this is your idea of a credible lie, I feel sorry for you.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Smoothly, he turned his frozen pose into a stretch, as if he had intended to do that all along.

But any excitement brought forth by the arrival of the Master soon died, as James immediately shifted into shopkeeper mode and denied him any chance of purchasing goods from the store. With a convenient excuse, no less.

<strong>&#39;Lies.&#39;</strong>

Which in turn earned him a figurative slap on the wrist. The boy turned around to face him, pinching one hand in front of his helmet and dragging it out, mimicking the growth of Pinocchio&#39;s long nose.

&#39;You won&#39;t be selling even if I come back the next day. Would you like to bet on it?&#39; Even though James couldn&#39;t see the boy&#39;s face, he could practically envision him sticking his tongue out from the tone of his voice alone. 

He rounded on Assassin next, as she danced around his accusations with the verbal grace and skill that wasn&#39;t dissimilar to a Knight-class Servant wielding their trusty weapons. Her silver tongue was sharp and cunning, but in response—

&#39;Is that all you&#39;ve got for me?&#39;

—the boy almost sounded disappointed, as if he had been interrupted in the middle of a story. &#39;Oh well, I guess that&#39;s a bit better than before. We&#39;re getting closer to the truth, but not quite there yet. You, Mr. Daddy, and everyone else, you&#39;re all such sticklers for certain untruths. So committed to these little white lies.&#39;

&#39;But hey, that&#39;s alright,&#39; the boy continued, his tone shifting from playful to thoughtful. &#39;<strong>Sometimes those untruths can be especially telling.</strong> And I think I&#39;ve learned enough already.&#39; He nodded, then placed both hands behind him and turned to face the Master and Servant both.

Yes, it was a lie and anyone with their ears clear and their heads out of the wineglass would be able to tell that it was a patent falsehood, but it was like he was having his heroes broken down before him.  If anyone in this world looked up to Triboulet, she&#39;d be flattered and tell them to pick someone better.

This was superceded by a real form of alarm that&#39;d follow her for the remainder of the encounter.  Her eyes widened, she crooked a finger in slight recoil and she took and held a breath.  Immediately after, wanting to ford any oncoming confusion, she spoke silently to James: <em>A Ruler...if he isn&#39;t being a little liar, he is a Servant of no Master.  They are supposed to be neutral mediators in wars that have become...a bit more aberrant than usual.  The Master of Ceremonies himself!  But why would he...</em>

As she finished that thought, she walked up around the side of the counter to stand next to him.  It would be a very stupid way of verifying his identity, but if it worked, she would seem all the more wise for it.  Showing little in the realm of self-preservation, she up and placed an arm around his shoulder, as one would to a friend, or an especially gregarious stranger.  &quot;Forgive us for our impropriety, then!  As I&#39;ve said, the clergy is no fan of mine - not to rub thy fur and leave it sticking askew - I did not want to bother the kind souls working there.&quot;

She leaned forward, trying to get her head into view of the futuristic visor - and in turn, perhaps sneaking the faintest glimpse past the darkened material - and smiled.  &quot;Tell you what - if you&#39;re a Ruler, and you&#39;re so concerned about the matter of &#39;truth&#39;, why don&#39;t we make it a matter of <em>trade?</em>  Surely, the kind and not-at-all greedy members of that church taught you the nature of commerce.&quot;

<em>&#39;Well, as long as we didn&#39;t break any rules, we should be fine. That is if they are just checking up on us like they say.&#39;</em> James was still cautious towards their guest despite the reveal of their status. Even if he looked like a kid, Ruler was still a Servant. 

James didn&#39;t know much about Rulers, nor did he even know of their existence until just now, but if they are meant to watch over Holy Grail Wars then they must have a trick or two to stand up against the others. It was <em>that</em> unknown that kept James on edge. The anxiety was enough to get him to rub his command spells subconsciously.

It definitely didn&#39;t help that Assassin would go and act all buddy-buddy with them so casually either! Well, whatever happened will happen he guessed.

The game that Assassin came up with seemed like a good idea. An innocent game like that should help to ease the tension in the air before it comes crashing down on them all.

But as luck would have it, Assassin was no ordinary cat, with more than nine lives to spare. She stood before the enigmatic boy, all pretenses dropped — or so she had him believe. In one smooth yet daring move, she stole an arm around his shoulder, and used the opportunity to peer into the helmet.

At first, all she saw was her own reflection, a distorted, ghostly image that seemed to mock her curiosity. The visor seemed like an impenetrable void, gleaming with the light refracting off its smooth surface. Was this it? Was her Servant-tier eyesight to be defeated by the esoteric principles of optical theory?

Assassin leaned in closer, until her forehead was almost touching the helmet. Subtly, she used her hold around the boy to nudge them ever so slightly away from the blinding ceiling lights.

And then she saw it.

Surrounded by soft, flowing, and unkempt hair, a pair of red eyes glowed in the darkness. Their shade was so rich that even the most exquisite pigments would pale in comparison. The impression reminded Assassin of a beast emerging from the woods, though there was far more intelligence in their depths. Yet, as Assassin stared, she couldn&#39;t help but sense something that was almost inhuman in their composition, even as a fellow Servant who had transcended the bounds of mortality...

&#39;Okay! I&#39;ll play.&#39;

Ruler patted Assassin on the cheeks, and the spell was broken. He pulled away from her, and his visor returned to its usual pitch blackness. &#39;I&#39;ve never done any &quot;trades&quot; before. But this sounds fun, so count me in. But what question should I ask?&#39;

&#39;Can&#39;t be something I already know.&#39;
&#39;Nothing I can deduce by myself.&#39;
&#39;But that leaves very few questions...&#39; The boy sighed, his energy deflating a bit as he realized the monumental task imposed upon him.

He scratched his helmet.

&#39;How about something that&#39;s more fun to hear from you rather than figuring out on my own?&#39; He suggested. Then, without waiting for confirmation, he blurted out his question.

&#39;Why do you seek the Holy Grail?&#39;

He extended his arms towards the both of them, palms facing up. &#39;Naturally, this question applies to the both of you.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 7:39 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096413622319718521 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096413622319718521><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 7:36 AM">7:36 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her Master would&#39;ve been kept from seeing this sight, but he could definitely see the slight blanche his Servant&#39;s face took.  She had seen reds that were already brighter than any natural shade, the sorts of royal pigments that the poor and destitute of Paris would be grateful to see once in their lives.  Worth their weight in gold they were, applied to garments and tapestries worth more than a man&#39;s life - and they seemed dull when put next to the deep, <em>profound</em> red of Ruler&#39;s eyes.  Looking at it was almost hypnotic, and the strangeness surrounding this red made it all truly entrancing.

Thus, when broken out of her trance with a couple quick pats to the cheek, it took her a second or two before she stopped staring at the featureless black that had returned to cloak the red.  She unconsciously took a step back from him as he pulled away, and she squinted at him.  Something indeed felt...false?  Artificial?  Beyond human?  She couldn&#39;t place a word to that aspect of Ruler, and for someone whose quick tongue was her very lifeblood, that just made that unsettling feeling worse.  Assassin was left to wonder, and wonder she did.

This left her a bit off-kilter when he finally did come up with a question, after much hemming and hawing.  She blinked once, and briefly pulled up a finger, and then let it hang down right after - it was a revealing question, but there were far more harmful ones she could&#39;ve been asked.  It was just...

...no.  This Ruler wouldn&#39;t accept that as an answer, would he?  Any answer except the most disappointing one.  At least she had another one, far more flamboyant, but one that her heart wasn&#39;t set on.  Truthful, for it was something she had a great reason to request, but would she really ask for this in the end?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096512934366150828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096512934366150828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 2:10 PM">2:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She chuckled, her grin returning.

Her hand twirled round, then once more, and she held it to her chest.  &quot;Why, I want the death and destruction of all of Nobility.  The very concept itself should be erased from history, and let those bastards and slatterns rot down here with the common folk.  People shouldn&#39;t become lords simply because their fathers were!&quot;  She nodded to her own statement.  &quot;You&#39;re simply a Ruler, though, not a noble.  I hope.

However, a tinge of caution washed over him once he noticed the lack of much reaction from her side. As quickly as it came though, the alarms faded away as whatever happened died down and the atmosphere returned. 

With the agreement made to play the proposed game, James sat down on the stairs. The mood needed less people on edge it seemed. Besides, who would dare attack them while Ruler was there. Surely there&#39;s a rule against that, right? Right?

James listened as Ruler rambled on to himself about what kind of question he should ask first. The conclusion he came to was a simple but heavy question. It was something he never spoke to Assassin about since summoning her. There was no reason not to tell her. It simply never came up as a topic. 

<em>&quot;Why, I want the death and destruction of all of Nobility...&quot;</em>

Honestly, watching Assassin up to this point made that wish come to no surprise to James. Hell, if he was in her shoes, he might develop a hatred towards the Nobility as well. There was no looks of judgment sent her way after she revealed her answer. That counted for something. It had to. 

Now the ball was passed to James, though.

Unfortunately, he couldn&#39;t just lie. Ruler could see through them with ease. Servant bullshit, probably. There was no getting around it, nor could he question it. The sole option was to just be honest.

&quot;My wish is not so grandiose so apologies for the disappointment.&quot; James paused for a moment. Hesitation nearly claimed him before his mouth opened again. &quot;I want to wish to cure my daughter of her illness before it&#39;s too late. I&#39;m running out of options. That&#39;s why I&#39;m seeking the grail.&quot;  A selfish wish for sure, but is there any Master here with a truly selfless wish competing?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096673676746829904 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096673676746829904><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 12:49 AM">12:49 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I made a promise to the Sister that I&#39;d be extra vigilant. Glad you understand.&#39; Ruler drunk in Assassin&#39;s praise. He grabbed a nearby stool and sat on it in a cross-legged manner, while the Master and Servant duo pondered the question they had been given.

It seemed that they both took it quite seriously this time, and in turn, the boy seemed to find their answers acceptable. At the very least, there were no booing or interruptions from him as the Assassin pair spoke. Ruler simply rocked back and forth on the stool, waiting until they had finished speaking.

He patted his chest in relief as Assassin dropped a bombshell. &#39;Oh, good. Dodged a bullet there,&#39; he giggled. &#39;By the time I was born, the power of the nobility had dwindled to nothing more than a mere title. Calling my father by his title would&#39;ve been as pointless as calling each cookie in a tin jar by their names. They are all crumbly confectionary that gets eaten before their expiry dates. Once digested, you can&#39;t tell them apart.&#39;

He then turned to James.

And regarded him with utter silence.

Five seconds passed, then ten, then a whole minute went by. Time stretched on, and Ruler stared at James&#39; face, as if his brain had momentarily short-circuited. Was there something on his face? Or had his answer simply fallen flat?

Then, as abruptly as he stopped, Ruler spoke again, but rather than a playful response the likes of which he had given Assassin, his words sent a chill down James&#39; spine.

&#39;You can always raise another daughter, if the first one is no good.&#39; The helmet hummed.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 3:50 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096895731647905864 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096895731647905864><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 3:32 PM">3:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It felt as if time froze in place. For a moment it felt like James answered the question incorrectly. Was his wish truly not enough to be a satisfying answer? The idea behind it seemed like it was a just enough of a reason for him to risk his life, hence why he felt the grail chose him! The fact that this brat chose silence as a response was so insulting...

Well, that was what he <em>thought</em> was insulting before he heard his next words.

<em>&#39;You can always raise another daughter, if the first one is no good.&#39;</em>

<em><strong>thud</strong></em>

Unlike with Ruler&#39;s response, what happened next happened almost immediately. Like a delicate line audibly snapping, James got up, made a bee line straight towards Ruler, and reeled back his leg to deliver a kick straight at the child-sized Servant on the stool.

&quot;<strong>Watch your mouth, you damn brat!</strong>&quot; Sure. Kicking a Servant wasn&#39;t the smartest idea one could think of. James, however, was not thinking. Whether or not it actually did anything to Ruler meant nothing to James. The anger just needed to get vented one way or another.

&quot;Ruler or not, there is nothing in this world, or Throne, that gives you the <em>right</em> to say shit like that!&quot; The stoic expression of James was gone. Teeth were gritted. His gaze felt like it would soon bore a hole through his shades. Fuming would be an understatement. &quot;I don&#39;t even know whether the grail could make such a wish like that come true but <em>nothing will stop me from at least trying to find out</em>.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096928443251314748 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096928443251314748><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 5:42 PM">5:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They really are just like little biscuits, aren&#39;t they?  Some are showy and some are sweet, but you forget about them the hour after you&#39;ve eaten them...

For a bit, that was what she thought about, but James&#39; wish was something she reacted to viscerally.  Her whole body turned to him, looking up at him, but she didn&#39;t betray her surprise.  Just a general, neutral regard.  Internally, though, she almost didn&#39;t believe him.  The man was grave at best, clearly haggard from a sad life, but to go out and kill people, and be killed...over a daughter?  She didn&#39;t imagine he had it in him!  Because...

...well, that was something she knew far too well.  In God&#39;s name, did she know it well.  And when she did what she did, ruining her life beyond repair, it was done out of a fear that consumed her, mind, body and soul.  She just didn&#39;t see the man being fearful, and what else would drive him to it?

Her surprise and her internal debate almost carried her through the most awkward pause they shared yet.  Once she realized, she looked back at the strange kid, waiting for him to give a response.  She was about ready to say something irreverent to break the silence, something to the effect of &#39;If you&#39;ve got nothing more to say, let me get back to something more important like sleeping&#39;, but then he responded.  Then, James went and did his best.

And, in all honesty, for a split second, she understood.  Punt the little shit.  Daughters aren&#39;t replaceable.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097038718944157756 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097038718944157756><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 1:00 AM">1:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Triboulet&#39;s senses came to her right afterward.  She shouted &quot;By god, sir!&quot; as James threw out his first threat, talking over him in the sudden chaos.  She immediately stepped between James and Ruler, pushing back at her Master to get him the hell away from the child as he continued giving him quite the what-for!  The level of understanding that she had for him evaporated under the clear and obvious danger his anger had just unleashed on them - this was a goddamned <em>Servant</em> he assaulted!  He had managed to kick a <em>Servant in the face,</em> and knocked him clear off his seat!  If the thing wasn&#39;t liable to up and kill them in the next second, she&#39;d have respect beyond words for him!

But nevermind that, she also immediately felt conflict.  What Ruler said was reprehensible, yes, but the man had just kicked a child with the full intent of hurting him.  The child was a Servant, yes, and by definition he was older than he appeared to be, but beyond little bits and pieces here and there, the feeling she got from Ruler was that of a real child.  Stupid, precocious, and prone to saying things without understanding what they mean.  James&#39; own actions were done without thought, clearly, but it wasn&#39;t something she could abide by either - she drew the boundary at children.  There&#39;s few excuses to be made.

There was a shuffle as she pushed him back a few steps, doing so without much issue even with their clear difference in size.  When Ruler looked back at them, he&#39;d be greeted with the strange sight of a man trying to be protected by someone two thirds his height, bracing a knife in defense.  &quot;Clearly, your church friends didn&#39;t teach you to respect your elders!&quot;  It was a lame joke that she said out of reflex, and her wavering tone carried the bizarre mix of feelings Assassin had in the moment.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

James had hit a homerun. With little in the way between him and Ruler, his leg had met little resistance as it connected with Ruler&#39;s torso, sending the kid flying off the stool and crashing over the counter. The miniature TV that Assassin had been intently studying got knocked off as well. The sound of glass breaking and metal bending followed suite; there was no doubt that the screen had been shattered and the antenna, broken.

Poor Triboulet! An entire day&#39;s work, gone like that.

&#39;Oof.&#39;

A voice bubbled up from behind the counter, following by five fingers, then another five, as Ruler used the counter as support and pulled himself up from the floor. Now standing in the cashier&#39;s position, he peeked at the Assassin pair, dust bunnies and bits of metal sticking to his clothes.

&#39;Ugh, that wasn&#39;t as graceful as I&#39;d hoped,&#39; the boy muttered, trying to brush off his blunder with a self-deprecating remark. &#39;Note to self: avoid impromptu acrobatics in the future.&#39;

But despite his disheveled state, he didn&#39;t sound hurt at all. Though that was only to be expected, as what was a Servant if they croaked from a human&#39;s touch? James was strong, but fueled by pure emotion rather than Mystery, his attack wouldn&#39;t have caused even a scratch on a Servant. It was astonishing that his kick had managed to connect at all!

Ruler rummaged behind the counter and emerged with a box of tissues. He tore a few from the package and began wiping his helmet with meticulous care, making it squeaky clean.

&#39;My church friends have nothing to teach me anyway,&#39; he stated matter-of-factly. &#39;Besides, I was only making an observation. As the arbiter of this War, I can&#39;t exactly take sides, you know.&#39; He wagged a finger, and spoke as if he were trying to lecture the adults.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097513149671936010 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097513149671936010><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 17, 2023 8:25 AM">8:25 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the only one in the store.  Sorrow!  Calamity!  Whatever &#39;Astro Boy&#39; was would go unseen, perhaps forever, by the eyes of a Servant - look upon Assassin&#39;s cringing face and know the pain of her second greatest devastation in her life.

In all seriousness, it took her a bit longer to get the sense that she wasn&#39;t about to be engaged in a duel to the death.  Her knife remained pointed at the boy until a moment after he started wiping his helmet down.  There&#39;s no reason for him <em>not</em> to try and take his revenge, and yet, an attack didn&#39;t come.  Sure, this was a child, not the sort of thing that carries a grudge easily...no, even this was too little for a child.  A child would cry, or start biting back with a dumb insult, or just flail their fists impotently.  Not jut sit there with a snide comment.

Though she still wanted to see him as one, the complete inaction, lack of reaction, made her feel disquieted.  Not enough to make her turn or wholly distrust him, but the notion that this was something <em>in the body of a child</em> started to gain sway...

Her knife was lowered, but she remained in front of James and the weapon remained unsheathed.  &quot;...What you see as an observation, my Master sees as a bitter insult.  Though it hardly excuses it.&quot;  There was a slight tone of anger directed upward.  &quot;What have ye, that you couldn&#39;t solve with words?  Shame on you, Master.&quot;  She said this and tried to inflect it sarcastically, if only because she didn&#39;t want to get kicked across the room as well.  &quot;Look at us, we&#39;re being terribly rude...&quot;

&quot;...to someone who still owes us a question.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just as he was about to bite back at his &#39;observation&#39; comment, his Servant took centre stage instead, shutting his mouth before more venom could spew out at Ruler. For now, he bit his tongue and held it back while he did his best to cool off. 

The beratement that came from her slowly worked to bring James back down. Sure, he could have handled it better, but it wouldn&#39;t have felt <em>as good</em> as punting the brat did. She brought up a good point as well; he did owe them a question.

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; James brought his guard down while his breathing simmered down. The pains from his last fight was aching again thanks to his recklessness. &quot;I got one for you, Ruler.&quot;

I forgot that humans have a tendency to take offense at the truth, and spoke bluntly.&#39;

He conceded politely, but not entirely apologetic. Perhaps Assassin&#39;s gut feeling was right. A Servant&#39;s physical appearance didn&#39;t always reflect their true age or experience, and Ruler may just be a prime example...

After all, aside from myths and fiction, what type of character reached the pinnacle of their career in their youth?

&#39;Don&#39;t worry, I have no intention to fight.&#39; Ruler reassured the Assassin pair, taking in their effort to quell their agitation. He pulled himself up onto the counter and sat there, legs swinging idly over the edge.

&#39;However, I also have no intention of addressing your question,&#39; he turned to James. &#39;How did your daughter fall ill? Is there hope for her recovery? Why did it have to be her and not someone else?&#39; He counted out several more questions, each one complementing James&#39; own. &#39;But even if you were to get an answer out of me, would it change anything? You have already told me your wish. Would learning the truth stop you from trying?&#39; 

He waited for the words to sink in.

&#39;See, answers aren&#39;t all that important. The <em>truth</em> itself isn&#39;t important. What matters most is the act of <em>observation</em>. It&#39;s all about comprehending your reality and working out a process to achieve a future that you desire. It&#39;s simple, really,&#39; he said, stretching both arms over his head as if he had just finished a workout. 

&#39;Even as I speak, your mind is already priming itself to reject my response if it doesn&#39;t align with your goal. You&#39;re already working out alternatives based on what I <em>might</em> say. In other words, through your own observation, you have already rejected the possibility of the truth.

<em>&quot;In other words, through your own observation, you have already rejected the possibility of the truth. Isn&#39;t that right, James?&quot;</em>

Was he already rejecting the truth without him even acknowledging it? His fists clenched up as if in anger at the answer to that question. Although James didn&#39;t know where the anger was being directed at exactly. At himself? At Ruler? At the grail? It could be anyone, honestly. 

&quot;Whether I&#39;m already rejecting out of fear of the answer or not, you little brat, that doesn&#39;t change that I would do anything for my little girl!&quot; He blurted out, this time without a punt, fortunately. &quot;So show me already!&quot; Assassin kept him from asking any more harshly than he&#39;s already been by taking up the spot in front of him. It was a simple act, sure, but it held more weight than one would think.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099290097297408011 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099290097297408011><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 22, 2023 6:06 AM">6:06 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still, I&#39;m <em>unable</em> to answer that question.&#39; 

Ruler tsk-tsk&#39;d James. He stopped swinging his legs, his childish demeanor fading a bit as James grew more tense in response. He bowed his head for a moment and did not move. Just sat there, frozen, allowing James to stew in his own anger.

It almost seemed as if he was lost in thought. But then came a low buzzing sound, one that grew, and grew. The sound was so sharp and invasive that at first, James and Triboulet thought a window had been left ajar and that a mosquito had flown into the shop, but then they realized that wasn&#39;t it.

It was in their mind. Almost as if someone had tapped into a radio wire at the back of their heads, causing static to flood through them, hopping from one frequency to another in an attempt to establish a clear channel. Then the noise ceased, and Ruler&#39;s voice pushed through.

<em>&lt;But I <strong>can</strong> grant you the power to see for yourself, if you&#39;d like?&gt;</em>

The thought suspended itself in the Assassin pair&#39;s mind. The experience wasn&#39;t unfamiliar to how they&#39;d communicated via telepathy, only that Ruler&#39;s words weighed several times heavier as they unfurled, as if they were trying to occupy every recess of their brains.

&#39;Can&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;ll like what you find, though.‘ 
&lt;It also doesn&#39;t come cheap.&gt;
&#39;You&#39;ll get a nosebleed.&#39;
&lt;And that&#39;s if you&#39;re lucky, and Assassin doesn&#39;t kill me in the process.&gt;

His voice rang out, both in their minds and through their ears.

&#39;Do you still wish to proceed?&#39;

She didn&#39;t have to do much to keep violence from escalating once again, just stand there - though prepared to kick James in the shins, she had no reason to.  Good.  Adhere to your station, Mr. Rellum.

As Ruler remained non-committal in his answers, Triboulet turned to look up at him.  A thin layer of pleading, a <em>give it up already</em> came embedded in her gaze - &quot;Let&#39;s give our guest a gift,&quot; she said in an attempt to dismiss the Servant from their home, &quot;and call it a day, hmm?  Can&#39;t let an old man like you get up...to...&quot;

It started as she spoke, and by the time she drew off from her thoughts, it became audible enough to be distracting.  And then, more and more, to the point that it would have been hard to hear her if she did continue speaking.  This was a noise alien to her sensibilities, and as she turned slowly to face Ruler again, she was clearly certain about its origin.

There was no doubt afterward.  She held a hand up to her head, not feeling pain so much as simply being unable to come up with a better answer in reaction for this wholly new sensation, of one singular thought taking up every corner of her brain - and one not hers at all.  It felt like the words he &#39;spoke&#39; were almost imprinting itself into every applicable sense, and what they conveyed was clearly a dangerous thing.

A simple offer: information for...what?  Danger?  Pain?  Nothing worth it.  As if James&#39; question was difficult to answer.

She stiffled a glare and put on a smile, though much more critical than her earlier attempts at placating the boy.  &quot;You&#39;re smart if you realize the danger you&#39;re bringing on yourself.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100195882361692170 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100195882361692170><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 24, 2023 6:05 PM">6:05 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>Be incredibly cautious,</em> her voice came through, though dim in comparison to the voice of Ruler, still ringing in her Master&#39;s mind.  <em>He&#39;s asking you to give yourself to him.</em>

<em>Is the risk worth it?  I understand your desire, my Master, I truly do, but it&#39;s pure stupidity to throw yourself into his waiting arms.</em>

He only stopped when his body pushed against Assassin&#39;s own, reminding him of her and the need to think clearly. Maybe a kick to his shins <em>was</em> needed.

Just as his servant attempted to reason with him to get Ruler out of their home before more conflict flared up, the voices came. They sunk deep into his mind. It stole from him his balance, even if it was but for a moment, until he recovered. He <strong>knew</strong> Ruler had some more tricks up his sleeve! However, rather than caution, a sense of curiosity seeped into his mind. To be able to see the possibility of a happy life of his daughter was more than tempting. 

The daunting task of making it out on top of this massive, abnormal Holy Grail War would be made all the easier if he could just glance at the prize. One glance and he would have it inside of his memories. So what of the price to be paid? 

<em>As stupid as you and I are, maybe we&#39;re not THAT stupid.</em>

Of course not. 

It would be foolish of them, after all.

What fools they would be <em>not</em> to take this chance when it is presented in front of them so easily, of course.

A hand was placed upon Assassin&#39;s shoulder. A sign of support, perhaps? The gentle push to shove her aside to face Ruler himself said otherwise. 

A fire was hidden behind those shades of his. A steady determination that was ready to do whatever it was needed for her. 

Before he spoke, James inhaled in preparation for what might come his way. Fists were formed as he stood firm against Ruler, ready to bear whatever price had to be paid.

&quot;<strong>Yes. I do.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100752325053784094 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100752325053784094><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 26, 2023 6:56 AM">6:56 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He turned out his pockets and shrugged apologetically, narrowly missing the threat underlying Assassin&#39;s words.

&#39;But perhaps I can more than make it up to you by giving your Master what he wants,&#39; he continued. Then, without missing a beat, that same voice spoke in the Assassin pair&#39;s mind again.

<em><strong>&lt;Your input has been confirmed, Mr. Rellum. I will now deploy my secondary Noble Phantasm,&gt;</strong></em>

In an instant, pain consumed James, seeping into every inch of his body like a thousand writhing snakes forcing their way through his veins. The sensation was excruciating, and his blood vessels bulged in protest, threatening to burst open—

<em><strong>&lt;Eternity, by the Stars.&gt;</strong></em>

—And then, as suddenly as it had come, the pain subsided completely, leaving behind a vast void that rivaled the emptiness of space. James felt as if his mind had been expanded in the process.

Then an overwhelming amount of information began pouring in. An eruption of facts and concepts and theories and experiences, from the past to the present to the future, bursting in his mind one after another after another. They quickly filled the void, saturating every corner of his consciousness until he could no longer tell himself and the world apart...

Was this the risk Ruler had been hinting at? The boy&#39;s words almost sounded laughable in retrospect, as James had never felt more powerful than he did in this moment. With so much knowledge at his fingertips, he felt invincible, as if nothing could faze him anymore. After all, anything he wished to know was just a glimpse away...

&#39;A chair, quickly.&#39;

How peculiar, the discrepancy between James and her. What could her Master possess that she didn&#39;t —or perhaps it was the opposite, that she possessed something that James lacked?

&#39;And some chocolates. Food, if you keep them stocked.&#39; Ruler continued.

Yet, in his stubbornness, he still attempted to brace himself for the &#39;attack&#39; he couldn&#39;t have seen coming. 

&quot;<strong>AAARGH!!!</strong>&quot; 

The agony of Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm was enough to bring him to his knees as he clutched tightly onto his chest to ease his suffering. His vision blurred as the waves of pain crashed against his body repeatedly, causing him to hunch over even further after each one. His eyes frantically stared at the ground in hopes of finding a focus point to distract his mind even for a bit. However, with each movement made, caused by him or because of the pain itself, another surge of pain occurred, earning another cry of pain from the man.

Then the pain subsided.

The muscles eased up and James appeared as if he would go limp any second now. The breathing from the man was ragged and sweat fell from his forehead onto the ground. It made him easy to move, at least.

While his body recovered, his mind was dealing with the vast pools of knowledge that opened for him. <em>Everything</em> from everywhere was there for him to access. Well, it felt like everything was. Navigating through past, present, and future to find what he needed was damn near impossible. One could easily drown in such an ocean of information after all.

&#39;<em>...Come on, you old bastard...</em>&#39; Jabs were sent at himself as he attempted to focus onto what he wanted to know rather than to continue to fall further into eternity. And, for a second, he succeed. A glimpse was all he could find before it was swept away. It was all he needed though. For what he saw was his daughter finally out of bed and running around her room, freed from the sickness that kept her bedridden. The last thing he was able to see what the two of them holding each other before he noticed reality around him once more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101224805329551430 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101224805329551430><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 27, 2023 2:14 PM">2:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She didn&#39;t go so far as to apply face to palm, but she held her further words, none of which were polite.  After all, she was just about ready to go and let him deal with whatever hell he had invited.  Go and learn a lesson from this, doesn&#39;t really matter if we lose, and you&#39;ll have plenty of time to self-reflect upon what may have been the better choice once you&#39;re dead.  Ruler&#39;s continued banter about identity almost fell on deaf ears, but she returned with two words alone.

<em>Noble Phantasm?!</em>  Briefly she sputtered mentally, caught off guard by both the announcement and James&#39; shriek of pain, and seriously suggested <em>Punt that thing again!</em>

Her mind was awash and lost right after.  She had all right to up and sink a knife into that helmet and wash the red right out of it, but much happened in the same moment.  James returned from his pain, though debilitated, and was clearly deeply affected.  She was not, but she felt as if she was being watched with keen interest - an unwelcome feeling, always.  Ruler made requests <em>(demands?)</em> of her, and stood there, content in his little bubble.  She could cut him, she could acquiesce, she could help James...

...it wasn&#39;t the right choice, but she chose the fourth option: all of the above.

Instantly, she jumped from behind the counter in a blur of color and made way to the front door, grabbing the wooden chair that sat in a near corner without pause and bringing it back.  James was pushed up on top of it, without any issue on Triboulet&#39;s part, and she heard in the corner of her mind - not the all-present voice but the mortal one - a request for chocolate.  The only thing he&#39;d get out of her is an annoyed grunt before she sped off again, to the storage in the back, and she returned nearly the same moment, just as James was about to teeter over, beating at his chest.  She pushed him back upright and then made good her final step in the list.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101338735439794218 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101338735439794218><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 27, 2023 9:46 PM">9:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>What James returned to, from the moment he felt an unimaginable connection that she could only wish for, was a strange sight.

One held a knife close to his chest, and the other held a package of <em>Biscato Chato,</em> a local vanilla-chocolate confectionary.

She took a breath to recollect herself from that sudden burst of exertion.  &quot;Alright.  Let James out of whatever you&#39;ve locked him in, and you&#39;ll get your chocolate.  Keep him in pain, you get the other thing.  A simple decision!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>For now,</em> he thought to himself. Not that he&#39;d say anything about it, of course. 

&#39;I guess you&#39;ll have to give me the other thing then.&#39; He cocked his head, and raised his hand to touch the tip of the knife held close to his chest. &#39;I can&#39;t let him out.

He pulled a beggar&#39;s stunt and cupped his hands, the skin of which had started to take on an iridescent sheen. &#39;Please?&#39; He asked. &#39;I&#39;ve been nothing but good.&#39;

The scene he wanted so desperately to see. It was short-lived but it was just as sweet as he imagined it would be. 

When it came to, it took him a bit to get his surroundings. James found himself sitting on a chair being balanced by the foot of Assassin? The scene had him follow her leg to see her threatening Ruler. With so many events having been witnessed by him, reality was difficult to discern apart from the scenes he saw so it took him awhile to understand what was going on.

&#39;<em>...but it&#39;s up to him to decide when he&#39;s had his fill. Isn&#39;t that right, Mr. Rellum?</em>&#39;

Those words stuck out the most for him. So he can see more then? More of her daughter all well and fine. That made the pain he felt almost worth it, if he was being honest. However, if that was the case then, he needed to be smart with what else he wanted to know from Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm.

To prevent the loss of such a powerful tool at their disposal, James made a grab for Assassin&#39;s arm. &quot;Wait!&quot; The lack of air that still plagued his lungs had him pause to gather his breath for a bit. &quot;Assassin. Stand down. <em>We can use this to our advantage.</em>&quot; It was a risky plan but, to see that scene of his daughter with his own eyes, no risk was too much in his eyes when he considered the prize. 

After regaining more of his breath, he tightened his still weak grip on her before speaking once more. &quot;We can find our targets with this.&quot; The man spoke with a weak smile on his face. He used Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm once already and it left him in such a state. Who knows if he was even thinking straight at this point?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101980973664571552 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101980973664571552><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 29, 2023 4:18 PM">4:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Turning back, straining her neck at an uncomfortable angle to look at him while continuing her gymnastic pose, she didn&#39;t let up her threat just yet.  The possibility of this really being of use helped, the ability to find an easy mark was even better, but the little shit had been as cryptic as possible and she had no proof he wasn&#39;t charmed, or delirious...

...but she looked back at Ruler, took her knife, and with one quick cut, she...sliced open the packet.  With a shake or two, into his waiting hand came a few of those chocolatey biscuits, and the woman who dispensed them didn&#39;t seem very thrilled about it.  &quot;You get more if you keep being helpful by James&#39; reckoning.  Too many at once and you&#39;ll get fat...just like a real Ruler.  All of them, corpulent piles.&quot;  She stuffed the knife back into the hidden side of wherever she might be keeping those, let James free of her leg, and took one biscuit for herself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

We don&#39;t get fat.&#39; 

He stated the obvious, effectively killing the joke. Nevertheless, he patted his own belly, as if to make sure that he hadn&#39;t mysteriously gained any weight in the meantime.

Sheesh, he really was no fun at all!

But at least Assassin could take solace in the fact that she had him under her thumb. Somewhat. Rather than prying the packet out of her hands, Ruler seemed content to wait for her to dispense more biscuits. After all, a deal had been struck. And who was he to go back on it?

&#39;I&#39;ve never done this!&#39; He said between mouthfuls of chocolatey biscuits that he expertly stuffed under his helmet, all without losing a single crumb. &#39;A therapy session, I mean. My Noble Phantasm is quite intuitive on its own. I didn&#39;t think anyone would need the help.&#39;

But despite his words, and perhaps, at the promise of more delicious snacks, Ruler kneeled at James&#39; side, both hands resting on his knees as he looked up at him. 

&#39;You can get more than just a blurry vision. If it helps by any means, think of it like using up a Command Seal. The more you think about what you <em>really</em> want to know, the clearer the answer will be. But if you ask for something totally impossible, well...&#39; He shrugged. &#39;You&#39;re not going to do that, are you? You&#39;re not a kid anymore.&#39;

He stole a glance at Assassin, a pretty self-explanation look that practically screamed, <em>&#39;Am I impressing you, or do I need to try harder?&#39;</em> and <em>&#39;Can I have another biscuit now?&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1103126827532300328 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1103126827532300328><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, May 2, 2023 8:12 PM">8:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="ms.diddles">@Ms.Diddles, Review Goblin</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Nor did he believe that he was making much sense. How could one even start to describe what he seen after all? Much to his relief though, Assassin backed off thanks to what little he could muster up the strength to say. 

&quot;Thank you...&quot; A weak voice managed to speak those words before James held his head down. His eyes were closed and a deep breath was made to prepare for another dive. 

There was a moment of hesitation. His body still remembered the pain as if it were still washing over him. Of course his mind kept him from inducing this torture upon himself. He kept the memories of his daughter inside of his mind to distract his common sense long enough to fall into Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm once more; this time in search of whatever he can find regarding the participants of this Grail War.

And in an instant the pain returned.

&quot;<strong>AAAAGH!!!</strong>&quot;

Almost immediately, James tensed up in the chair he was in. The following scream was stifled from the gritting of his teeth. The back of the chair strained as his weight was pushed against it. His feet dug and pushed against the floor as his sights remained fixed on the ceiling, though his gaze wasn&#39;t focused on it at all. Then the blood started to flow. First from his nose then from his mouth from the damage dealt to his gums from how hard he was grinding his teeth because of the pain. To make matters worse, James was attempting to gouge out his own throat in an attempt to relieve himself of the boiling he felt inside his own veins. All the while his mind was flowing through the endless sea of information that Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1104043110645899314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1104043110645899314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, May 5, 2023 8:53 AM">8:53 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Surely she wouldn&#39;t do the unthinkable...and dangle the crunchy snacks out of his reach in the last second? Because that would be way too cruel.

Though nothing could compare to the ordeal James was going through at the moment, as he delved deeper into Ruler&#39;s Noble Phantasm. The scream was short-lived, but it was enough to send shivers down anyone&#39;s spine.

Ruler seemed unfazed, however. 

&#39;You&#39;re getting the hang of it,&#39; he encouraged James, helmet bobbing up and down in approval. &#39;So, what did you see this time?&#39;

It was hard to tell whether he was used to seeing such unsettling display, or simply didn&#39;t care much about James&#39; well-being compared to the information he was able to grasp.

That was the best he could get before he returned back to the same reality once more.

He heard Ruler&#39;s childlike voice which helped to anchor himself back into this world. One glance at his overshirt and it appeared as if he threw up blood. With how much he was bleeding though, he might as well have. 

&quot;...Enough.&quot; A simple but effective answer. His vision had him seeing doubles. Any and all sounds were echoed and rang inside of his head louder than they had any right being. His balance even had him leaning off to the side. To say his senses were fucked was an underestimate. These didn&#39;t help the skull-splitting headache he had in the slightest.

To put the bleeding, James brought up his hand to cover his nose. This took him a few attempts but he eventually caught hold of it.

Or too much of one.  She did wave them just out of reach once, but handed them down right after - cruel but not too cruel, of course.  The rest were withheld, and probably just because of how violently James reacted after, it&#39;d be some time before he got any more.

Assassin stood next to him as he seized and fought, not moving to intervene or shake him free of his grim reverie.  The most she did was put a hand behind the chair as it threatened to fall backward from a particularly strong jerk, and as he tried to pull apart himself with his own hands, she gripped at them to hold them in place.  Even though her hands were much smaller than his, she held his fingers in place with a painful amount of force.  Maybe, perversely enough, the pain of almost having your fingers broken was enough to keep your mind off of the maddening drive to claw your own throat out.

Once he cooled down, quite possibly literally, his fingers were released - already a bit purple from the bruising that Assassin gave them.

&quot;You can&#39;t go much further,&quot; Assassin said as James tried to stem the bleeding.  There was some genuine concern, but at the same time, her tone correctly suggested she was just setting up for a joke.  &quot;You keep on and you&#39;ll lose enough blood, that I can&#39;t possibly shove it all back down your throat.  Let alone your shirts!  You didn&#39;t pack enough to waste them so wantonly.&quot;  She laughed, though briefly, somewhat bitterly.  &quot;Come now.  You said it, it&#39;s enough, and I&#39;m sure <em>you&#39;ve</em> earned yourself some biscuits.&quot;

A passing thought got her to turn around to look once more at Ruler.  He&#39;s taking this very easily, but is this his odd attitude...or familiarity?

&quot;My child, is he the first to make use of your...unique services?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He almost sounded proud, like someone who had just successfully conducted a science experiment for the first time. Was he not fully in control of his own Noble Phantasm?

&#39;I recommend some warm compresses,&#39; Ruler swiftly changed the topic.  He walked over to Assassin and cupped his hands to speak in a whispered tone. &#39;Staying in a well-insulated room would help too. Maybe we can wrap him up like a cocoon?&#39; He giggled at his own suggestion. &#39;Sensory deprivation can work wonders after what I&#39;d call an information overload to the brain.&#39;

Assassin had imagined a scenario where Ruler, eager to please and unknowing of the ruinous side effect of his power (as it certainly seemed like he was not all that trained in its usage), had ended up accidentally causing the spate of mysterious deaths within Berenice.  Undoubtedly he could find multiple people with a desire for knowledge and gift them everything they wanted, and far more than that.  However, two deaths doesn&#39;t a serial murderer make.

What was she left with?  A disturbing Servant that had proven its usefulness, but one that also had assuredly put her Master into convalescence and was also a drain on their cookie supply...the latter was more important than you&#39;d realize, trust me.  One that cavorted about in an alternating fit of childishness, shame and otherworldliness that made dealing with him a pain.

To let him go was to give the other participants in the war a tool that, in good circumstance, would prove invaluable.

...however, to let him go provided her the chance of perhaps seeing an enemy Master&#39;s head explode from thinking too much.

Triboulet knew what the right answer was.

&quot;It&#39;s going to get quite <em>dark</em> for him, then.&quot;  The rest of the biscuits were dropped onto the counter, unguarded, and - gasp - a <em>second</em> package was produced from some unseen nook, and placed alongside it!  James was once again hefted over her narrow shoulder like an especially bloody sack of potatoes, though with some care to not jostle his head about too much.  &quot;Make sure your church friends get some of those too.  The servants of God are dependent on alms, and the occasional bribe by royalty, so you should be able to provide both.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was a good chance that Assassin could just leave him on the ground and he wouldn&#39;t notice the difference between the two states. 

The bleeding stopped, at least. Though it was only his nose. His gums were another story and he wasn&#39;t all there yet to deal with that himself.

&#39;Food tastes so much better when you worked hard to get it.&#39; Ruler cradled the cookies in his arms, before ripping the plastic packaging right off. Unabashedly, he reached for the cookies and started feeding them under his helmet. Loud crunching ensued, Assassin&#39;s words of advice be damned.

&#39;They don&#39;t need cookies,&#39; he said in between mouthfuls. &#39;I can give them something much better. The priest also owes me for running his errands, so I think that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do next — go back and collect my dues.&#39;

In the form of more food, no doubt!

Ruler watched as Assassin helped her Master to his feet. He had no intention to lend his help - not that a fellow Servant would need it, anyway. It seemed that their rendezvous had come to an end, with both parties having received plenty to digest. With a swift turn on his heel, Ruler headed for the door, all the while clutching his delicious bounty.

&#39;Hey, you know what?&#39; He paused briefly at the doorstep and turned to addressed the duo. &#39;You can totally get what you wish for. Changing the past is no easy feat, but changing the future? That&#39;s a whole other story. You can definitely make it happen. I guarantee it.&#39;

Blankets, not just his own but enough for three people, weighed him down in a stifling layer of warmth.  His Servant had gotten his shoes off, and his jacket, but didn&#39;t try anything further.  The blinds were drawn, leaving only a lamp to illuminate this back room.  The interior of his mouth probably felt the most unpleasant, with a small towel having been stuffed inside to try and keep the bleeding contained, if not dealt with.

Assassin stepped back into view shortly, still as chipper as ever, and she was holding a few pieces of gauze from their small medical supply between her fingers.  &quot;I&#39;ve made your bed, now sleep in it,&quot; was her one joke before she replaced the towel with the gauze.  She didn&#39;t try to be too gentle as she stuffed the bits of cotton swab up his cheeks, but at the very least, he&#39;d be able to talk.  You know, in the off-chance that he&#39;d actually want to, after all of that.

&quot;Sitting here and making me act the role of a mother,&quot; she shook a fist at him in mock anger, &quot;you&#39;ve got quite the nerve!  As punishment, I tell you - sit down and don&#39;t think of anything.  At all.

His entire being suffered an extreme information overload that it was surprising that he was still conscious. If you can call it being conscious, of course.

A pained groan followed shortly after the towel was placed to stem the flow of blood in his mouth. If any words were spoken against these actions, they were all muffled beyond recognition.

There, wrapped up in a cocoon of blankets, with cotton swabs in his mouth, James was tended to by his Servant. Unlike other Servants, she had the luxury of leaving him for another Master whenever she pleased. This made her act of care confusing to him. Not like he could ponder on it for long, given any extended attempts to think caused his headache to split his head even further.

&quot;...Thanks...&quot; It was muffled but his words were clear enough to be heard. He wasn&#39;t to challenge Assassin, especially not after that threat of a mother&#39;s sandal <s>the most fearsome Noble Phantasm of any Servant.</s> &quot;...Sorry, as well...But...We are going to need everything we can get...due to the hand we were dealt, after all...&quot; His breathing interrupted his little speech before he closed his eyes.

The cad...&quot;  If this supposed hint towards the other Masters&#39; whereabouts proved at all useful, that would make things at least a little worthwhile.  At the moment, from her point of view, without that boon it seemed as if they had been kept in recovery for a few more days.  For a war, they had quite a lot of sitting and waiting to do, no?

&quot;I will, somehow, find medicine once more.  As long as I don&#39;t get you the wrong medicine and kill you, perhaps you&#39;ll rest a little easier, hmm?&quot;  Moving from his bed and toward the door, she held up his wallet and--wait, when did she even take it from him?
