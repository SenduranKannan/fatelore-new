It has been a handful of weeks since Marcus and Lancer first made each others acquaintance. The necromancer and Saint still seemed to remain on that uneasy ground of cooperation. Two opposing personalities forced to work hand in hand. 

This came with one silver lining. Extra hands when wanting to practice his craft. Especially if their first target was to be the skinwalker. A giant wolf would be the perfect way to collect materials. And prepare for their encounter. 

The man was barely illuminated by his cigarette in hand. Reaching the threshold to the graveyard. Taking another long slow draw from the thing in his hand. Marcus was unaware of how prepared he was to perform his family’s particular mage craft once again. After years of dealing with corpses of all states, in a significantly more respectful manner,  it was peculiar to take up the title of necromancer again.

“Lancer. What do you think about corpses?” The man spoke in between puffs of smoke coming from his mouth. “Are they something to be feared? Or something to be respected?” He turned towards his companion, dropping the dead butt of the cigarette and stamping out what embers remained. “How do you feel about raising the dead.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093263735516299484 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093263735516299484><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 2:59 PM">2:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Shf</em> <em>Shf</em> <em>Chik</em>

The silhouette of Lancer was barely illuminated by the flaring embers from Marcus&#39; cigarette, and just as quickly it faded back to the cover of late evening. It was just as well, as the sight of the bestial servant, with the pale blue of their eyes just visible enough to glow through the pitch of midnight, standing before the gaping hole of what was once a sacred grave could strike fear into even the most steadfast of courageous hearts. Or at least the most brazen teenagers. Which were the only ones that really took notice so late at night, and the only ones to even speak about it among their classmates. The past week had seen a few headstrong highschoolers trek into the graveyard to witness the creature, but they were quickly tested against the haunting stature of a bristling, tooth-gnashing creature that held the rotting corpses of Aswan in his claws. Their gatherings didn&#39;t last long. 

Which was all good by Lancer, as it would get annoying pretty quick if he had to keep dealing with them. Though it was perhaps only slightly worse to his current situation. 

The faux gold engravings of an aged casket peeked through the loosened shreds of dirt, revealing the prize Lancer was after. A corpse. 

His shovel shot forth from the hole, landing mere inches from Marcus&#39; foot, before the Servant climbed out from behind, easily hefting the massive oak casket across his broadened shoulders before setting it down flat before his Master, like a dog retrieving a bone. 

&quot;On one hand it can be somewhat disrespectful,&quot; The saint spoke, a small grunt punctuating the end as he tore open the lid of the casket, a cloud of dust, dead skin and must pluming out around him, causing his eyes to water as he waves at the cloud. &quot;<em>Koff koff</em> shit, that&#39;s gross...and slightly creepy. But, on the other hand, well...they&#39;re dead. Their souls are in a better place and not really using them anymore.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093365245134778468 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093365245134778468><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 5, 2023 9:43 PM">9:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A coffin which would have been beautiful, if not buried by a layer of well trodden earth and left to what lay below the surface. It was helpful to have someone so strong to dig up the corpses. Instead of having the legions of the undead drag themselves to freedom of the surface. It did lack flair, however, and a sense of true dread and terror. 

Like in that movie. Night of the Living Dead. It was such striking imagery after all.

While the figure of Christopher was large and intimidating enough to begin rumors, the shadow of Marcus was certainly an afterthought or embellishment. If the terror filled minds of those children even managed to catch his figure in the dead of the night. Fitting for the shadow of a man he once was. 

“I do get the point of the disrespectful nature of it.  Having to treat any and all corpses with some form of respect then going right back to this is certainly disorienting.” The necromancer approached the freshly placed coffin. That scent of decayed flesh barely phased the man. “A little too old to raise, but just fine to harvest from.” With that his coin was now a knife, glistening in the moon light. “But it is nice to have that sense of optimism in it all. Hopefully they aren’t staring down when I defile them.” 

With that the man’s knife plunged downwards into the chest. A mix of precision and just pure brutality. It was almost therapeutic to not have a care in the world with this corpse. No needing to preserve its beauty. It was just plain and simple utility. “Now, Jesus raised the dead sometimes, correct? Oh while you’re up there get his jaw.” Marcus commented as he finally broke into the chest cavity. Casual conversation was never difficult in these scenarios, well specifically for him. One who was raised around death, and who chose to work at that line between life and death.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093442642467102770 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093442642467102770><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 2:50 AM">2:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With a horrifying <strong>CRACK</strong> and <strong>SNAP</strong> his hands emerged from the cavity with a pair of ribs.

The coroner at work was...something to get used to. Each splinter of bone or squelch of viscera left a pit in Christopher&#39;s gut, the Servant turning away to glare into the dwindling silhouette of the scenic graveyard. Faint outlines of the tombstones curving over the rolling sweeps of plotted earth were just barely blotted by the crisp clarity that came from the light effervescence of the moon above. They were well and truly alone, lost among the shoddy refilled holes from Christopher&#39;s handiwork. 

&quot;...Cmon, do I have to?&quot; Christopher turned at Marcus&#39; behest, eyeing the loosely fitted jaw that hung slack, held together by dried and leathered skin. He grimaced as he knelt and gingerly held the with one hand. He pulled firmly with the other, and the jaw practically fell away, pulling sheets of cheek along with it. Christopher threw the jaw aside and fell back, the earth serving as a fine replacement for a towel to wipe away the dead flesh.

&quot;Come on, what the hell did you need me to do that for?! Can you at least show a little bit more courtesy, they&#39;re dead, not some toy to just tear apart. You&#39;re like a weirdo kid, same as that Ruler.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093739711765434418 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093739711765434418><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 6, 2023 10:31 PM">10:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

&quot;Jesus didn&#39;t &#39;raise rhe dead.&#39;&quot; The servant clarified for his Master as he wiped his hands across his cape, cheeks bulging slightly at the potential stain that would soil the cloth. &quot;At least not like this, he just gave the dead life.

Finally reaching the vertebrae buried in the deepest portion of the coffin. “You didn’t have to agree to dig up the corpses in the first place.” Marcus pointed out, pulling himself out of the coffin for a moment and pointing the knife towards his servant. 

Just as lancer pulled the jaw from the corpse’s face Marcus dug back in. “Difference between ruler and I, is that I have many excuses for being this strange. That thing, doesn’t.” With another motion of the knife Marcus was finally at his prize, and pulled out three vertebrae. Dramatically raising a hand upwards with his prize. That novelty of stealing corpses and bones, seemed to light anew in the man. Even if for a moment. There was less ennui and more vigor. 

“I would fail to see the difference between raising the dead, and giving them life.” The coroner added, tossing his prize into the pile of bones already being collected. “Fundamentally they are the same thing. Just with different names. And with different connotations from said names.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1093779987653468241 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1093779987653468241><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 1:11 AM">1:11 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His breaths came out in misty puffs as he moved, a visible reminder of the bone-chilling cold that pervaded Egypt&#39;s midwinter nights.

As someone who dealt with death in his profession, Lachlan had rarely visited graveyards, aside from the burial of his family members. The scent of decay always hung low in the air, something that had never sat well with his senses: it served as a reminder of the inevitable process of nature&#39;s course, something he had grown distant from, having become accustomed to the sterile smell of chemicals in his father&#39;s lab.

Yet, there was a somber beauty to graveyards that Lachlan could still appreciate, once in a while. The solitude brought him a sense of peace, knowing that those he despised would no longer bother him in death. The epitaphs stood as testaments of their permanent silence.

The tall figure next to him twitched under its leather coat. Lachlan threw them a look and they fell into silence once more.

He took his time examining the crumbling tombstones as he walked past them, reading the inscriptions that were barely illuminated by the dim moonlight and guessing at the alien characters. He wondered whether Bill would understand them, being blessed by the Grail with modern language that would allow them to navigate the world at large—

<em>&lt;Can you read any of this?&gt;</em> 

—And immediately shot a question at his Servant. Telepathy was a useful tool. A form of instant messaging the likes the world had never seen. All of his unfiltered thoughts, transmitted to his Servant in the blink of an eye.

He continued his leisurely stroll, following the distinct sound of metal scraping earth. The rhythmic clinks and thuds punctuated the otherwise eerie silence of the graveyard, guiding him towards the shadows moving in the distance.

When was the last time he had heard anything about the Adlers? They had once been prominent figures at the Clock Tower, but faded into what some called &#39;obscurity&#39; much like his own family. They, too, had chosen to distance themselves from the traditional practices of mages, opting for a modern lifestyle that suited the changing times.

It struck him as ironic, then, that the first official &#39;meeting&#39; between the families in decades would be in the midst of the prestigious Holy Grail War.

Finding purchase in a tombstone that looked relatively new, Lachlan used it as a makeshift seat as he watched Marcus work from afar. A large, furry creature accompanied the Coroner, undoubtedly his Servant.

<em>&lt;Looks like our friend has summoned Fenrir,&gt;</em> he silently remarked, slipping his hands inside his coat pockets to shield them from the chill.

Beside him, the imposing figure stood tall and silent, unmoving in response to the presence of the graveyard trespassers.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094055458928611439 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094055458928611439><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 7:25 PM">7:25 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The grotesque display of necromancy struck enough of a nerve that Lancer gazed past his Master, taking in the distant lights of downtown Aswan. It was so far, so faded, twinkling and fading into the night sky above. 

&quot;You&#39;re just making them move. They have no will. No dreams. That&#39;s not life, that&#39;s just animation. That&#39;s puppeteering.&quot; 

The air was still as his Master continued his work, though Christopher himself didn&#39;t quite understand the nature of emptying the rotted husk, though this age of magecraft often left the Lancer with a bitter bite of disgust in the back of his throat. He didn&#39;t understand it, and maybe it was better he never would. The only miracle he could&#39;ve known about was second hand information of water turning to wine.

Knife now turned into his lighter, as the necromancer pulled a cigarette free and lit up. 

“You know there’s that age old question of free will.” The man’s face slightly illuminated by that red glow of the cigarette.  “Are we all just puppets to some greater design, or are we all free to choose exactly how we live.” Another puff of smoke was exhaled. “I take some peace in thinking the former, rather than the latter.” 

The man’s sight drifted along with Christopher’s. Looking at the sparkling lights of Aswan in the distance. Opening up slightly about his own personal Philosophy. As depressing as it may be, it made sense for the man he was. 

Then drifting further. 

A different sight. Two figures. 

Marcus gave a dead stare towards them. Face illuminated by the light of his cigarette. Pale in the moonlight given a sharp shadow by the orange flame. “Company. I doubt there’s a child out there who’s nearly 8 feet tall.” 

“Maybe the lookouts should scare em a bit.” With that Marcus flexed his magical circuits. Calling upon those dead he had already reanimated, having them shuffle out from their scattered hiding spots within the graveyard. Making a slow March on the location of Lachlan. All in various states of decay. Each making a more horrific noise from their joints and throats than the last.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094128669833826394 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094128669833826394><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 8, 2023 12:16 AM">12:16 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Wild West was called that for a reason: None of those bustling metropolises of the modern age, but with all of the advancements in firepower and gunpowder. While it would be easy for Cherokee Bill to take cover in the concrete jungle of 1999 America, back in the day walking in plain daylight with a couple hundred bucks on your head meant that you&#39;d get shot from miles away.

The reason Bill had survived was nighttime escapades, followed by a reasonable 3 hours of sleep a day. His fellow gang members called him crazy, and he had always responded by saying that you could get 8 full hours of sleep in prison if you so pleased. The night and him were one, as he currently displayed, hidden in the shadows of the dark and being as present as a whisper. Only Lachlan was aware of his location, thanks to their mutual link.

<em>&lt;Do I look like a blind gunman to you? Of course I can read.&gt;</em> He immediately shut his Master down. <em>&lt;This one reads: Stop asking silly questions, unless you&#39;re a call girl. Good advice, I say.&gt;</em>

The link then turned quiet. Bill silently observed, watching Lachlan and Marcus talk as he focused on his main objective: The Servant the opposing Master had summoned. They were tall and covered in armor, something that he had never seen in person besides at shoddy 1800s era museums. All he knew about them was that they went extinct the moment the bullet was born.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094199952940482590 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094199952940482590><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 8, 2023 4:59 AM">4:59 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
And of course, their prominent, bestial head that resembled that of a wolf.

<em>&lt;Ya think it&#39;ll play fetch?&gt;</em> Bill quipped, much to Lachlan&#39;s (lack of) amusement. <em>&lt;I got a nice, shiny bullet for it to catch.&gt;</em> He started loading up his chamber, resting in the dark as his bloodlust gradually filled the air. The stench of a Servant&#39;s mana could be felt, but all signs pointed towards the tall figure that Lachlan had brought along. 

And then Marcus revealed his hand, sending a horde of shuffling corpses towards the Dowling heir.

<em>&lt;...Do you mages have a thing for dead bodies or what?&gt;</em> Bill asked with a mixture of curiosity and disgust. <em>&lt;I thank the Great Spirit every day that my funeral wasn&#39;t handled by you fucks. Anyway,&gt;</em> He grunted. <em>&lt;Need a hand, boss? Or you fine?

Come on, now. We scheduled this visit days ago. Surely you&#39;ve had enough of Roland&#39;s nagging in the meantime.&gt;</em>

He squinted into the darkness, assessing the situation with a calculating eye. Five? Six? A dozen? Two? The moonlight cast eerie shadows among the misshapen tombstones, further obfuscating the count. But one thing was for certain: the stench was growing stronger by the second.

<em>&lt;Actually, hold that thought.&gt;</em> He shot Bill another message. <em>&lt;If you still insist, I might just let you have the honor of helping me out. After all, who</em> wouldn&#39;t <em>want to steal my thunder, right?&gt;</em>

He still hadn&#39;t fully gotten over the incident in the air, it seemed. But the next second, the puppeteer&#39;s instructions already came flooding into Bill&#39;s mind.

<em>&lt;Take out the ones further away from me and try to keep their numbers manageable, but leave the ones closest to me alone. Make sure you mask the shots to make it look like they&#39;re coming from the big bloke, I want to see how far we get before the gig is up.&gt;</em> He said, rapping his knuckles against the tall figure standing next to him, as if to emphasize his point.

<em>&lt;If you&#39;re still bored out of your mind after all that, be my guest and entertain the Pupper to your heart&#39;s content, if he so much as bares a fang our way.&gt;</em>

With that, he hopped off the tombstone, and marched straight towards the faint orange glow of Marcus&#39; cigarette.

It soon became clear that the figure moved with a singular purpose: not to decimate the zombies, but to simply stop them from invading Lachlan&#39;s personal space. Their arms formed a protective circle around their Master, allowing him to make his way towards the Coroner with relative ease. 

&#39;Sorry to crash the slumber party,&#39; Lachlan raised his voice as he neared the Lancer pair, raising a hand in the process. &#39;Didn&#39;t receive an invite, but hope that&#39;s all fine.

Oh no, that&#39;s a Master and Servant. Most likely, Marcus didn&#39;t seem the type to just attack anybody without reasonable cause. 

Although, the shambling corpses were little in the face of the quick and precise strikes from the figure in the coat. They tore through rotted flesh and worn bone with relative ease, as if cutting through tissue paper to reach Marcus and Lancer, whom stood to his full height and placed himself between. He marveled at the height of the Servant in tow with Lachlan, as for the first time in his life, Christopher had to crane his neck back at the stature. Strange, he couldn&#39;t sense anything particularly powerful...an Assassin? But what kind of Assassin just openly reveals themselves, nevermind demonstrates their power so freely...

&quot;It&#39;s actually not fine, I&#39;ve already chased a few kids off tonight. I won&#39;t hesitate to spank one, too. Beat it. <strong>Now.</strong>&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s jaws clenched as he bared his own fangs, his own cloak rippling as he pulls his staff from its depths, hefting its weight and planting it firmly in the turned earth between him and the invaders...err, the second pair. The head of the stick came to eyesight with the towering figure. Christopher was dwarfed by them, something he&#39;d never experienced before. It was nothing if not intriguing. 

&quot;And take gruesome here with you. It&#39;s one thing to pop some corpses in the throat, but I guarantee you&#39;ll have a much harder time with me.&quot; A growl drifted on the last word as his eyes narrowed.

Depending on the hand that was shown towards the Coroner and his Saint. 

&quot;I would listen to the wolf. He&#39;s been in quite the bad mood tonight.&quot; The necromancer added to the threats given by his servant. Yet something struck him as odd about the figure following Lachlan. 

Another inhale, then exhale with a cloud of smoke. &quot;The Dowling Heir. I&#39;ll be damned. I was just about to hunt after you.&quot; The coroner took another step forwards removing the cigarette from his mouth, allowing its faint embers to burn away at the paper and tobacco within. Not quite exiting the reach of lancer, he held a hand to the side. Motioning for his servant to cool it down slightly. 

The warnings of Henrietta remained within his mind since leaving LA for Egypt. These two families would have the potential for interacting once again. Even if it had been nearly a lifetime ago when they both laid eyes upon one another. &quot;Tell him the Adler&#39;s send their coldest regards. An invite would have been preferred instead of crashing our little function, but we will make do with what we have.&quot; His analytical eye stared upon the form of Lachlan, then drifting upon that of the figure next to him. 

&quot;Now, is that one of your famous abominations or, your servant.&quot; The cigarette then met his lips once again, and he took a slow draw from it.

By the ninth second, he could already hear the Dowling heir go from confident to a bit amused. Seems like Marcus had summoned far more ghouls from the dead than Lachlan had hoped.

<em>&lt;Glad you could see reason. I counted around a dozen or so.&gt;</em> The outlaw joked. His eyes were surprisingly perceptive in the dark, as if it had become an acquired habit. Another habit was him being immediately receptive to orders, which he did the moment Lachlan asked for his help.

<em>&lt;Got it, boss. Just know that I work in bursts, ya get me? So don&#39;t worry; you won&#39;t be overshadowed.&gt;</em> He snickered, staring at the various tombstones adorned with aged blood and decrepit guts that had spewed out from the walking corpses. One could barely see those traces of black in the dark, but to Bill, it felt crystal clear. They weren&#39;t just marked tombstones: They were targets.

He whipped out his gun and took aim, closing one of his eyes for a perfect shot.

Something fired, but it was silent. Even the flash of gunpowder was gone. Instead, one of the tombstones broke, something ricocheting and colliding into a zombie with speed surpassing the human eye. It cleaved right through it, then through a corpse behind it, and another. Three corpses fell with Lachlan&#39;s partner towering above them. The leathery figure continued its strikes, each one followed with a tombstone breaking or several corpses dying in just one blow. Its range was terrifying, somehow being able to cleave through the mass of bodies with brief, controlled strikes. It was supernatural, even for a magus.

Marcus obviously had no clue why his thralls were falling so easily. He knew the Dowling magecraft well, along with the capabilities of their so-called &#39;puppets&#39;. Was his magecraft weak in comparison, or had the Dowling heir improved in such a short span of time? Both options made no sense to him, as if his instincts were warning him of something being off.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094647318852161636 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094647318852161636><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 9, 2023 10:37 AM">10:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
To tell the truth, Marcus was courting death, since Bill couldn&#39;t help but grumble as he heard the wolf and master chat idly while a fight was occurring.

<em>&lt;Why do they always talk like they have all the time in the world? Can&#39;t they tell that they are about to die?&gt;</em> He sounded annoyed, as if he had witnessed this same scenario several times. <em>&lt;Boss, I know you told me to look at the dog, but I&#39;m tempted to just put a lid on that old fellow&#39;s mouth. Sounds good? He&#39;s the Master after all.&gt;</em> In reality, Bill&#39;s gun was already aimed for Marcus&#39; lips in the shadows. The only reason he hadn&#39;t pulled the trigger was because he had already stolen Lachlan&#39;s kill once. He wasn&#39;t <em>that</em> much of an asshole to do it twice. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&#39;You know who I am,&#39; he replied, pressing a hand to his chest. &#39;Color me surprised, doctor.&#39;

He shook his head as Marcus restated his unwelcome, though there was more than just a lack of remorse in his action: it was a deliberate defiance that bordered insolence, as if he was playing up the part of a difficult schoolboy being scolded by a teacher. 

&#39;Ah, well. What can I say?&#39; He shrugged. &#39;I&#39;ve always been a go-getter. Waiting around for invitations has never been my thing. But hey, by the sounds of it, looks like I&#39;ve managed to save you some precious time anyway.&#39;

The nuances in Marcus&#39; words failed to escape him. He kept his gaze fixed on the faint glow from Marcus&#39; cigarette. &#39;So, hunting <em>me</em> down, huh? Why would you want to do that? Out families had no beef with each other.&#39;

His eyes briefly flickered to the wolf man.

&#39;Unless it was your Servant&#39;s idea?&#39;

Gingerly, Lachlan stepped over patches of freshly turned earth, mindful of the foul soil underfoot as he brought the party back to the Lancer pair. Being threatened by what looked to be a Werewolf wasn&#39;t exactly his idea of a good time, but he had taken some precautions, and the thrill of playing with fire remained enticing.

Silently, his &#39;manservant&#39; followed behind with careless stomps, crushing the earth beneath their feet. Mysteriously, the impact caused a few zombies to explode, but the rest recoiled, no doubt under Marcus&#39; command. They formed a loose circle around the group, not too close for comfort, but not far back enough to lose their threatening presence. A sign that Marcus still exerted control over the playground. 

Not that it was an unfamiliar sight to a puppeteer.

<em>&lt;But oh, well. Such is the plight of the less fortunate. Gotta make do with what you&#39;ve got, isn&#39;t that right?&gt;</em>

&#39;Why don&#39;t you introduce the Wolf first, Marcus?&#39; He addressed both the Master and the Servant, evading the million dollar question in the meantime. &#39;Show the young&#39;uns how it&#39;s done in a Holy Grail War? Or do you prefer to take a guess at mine first? See if your eyesight still holds up at your age?&#39;

Surely he wasn&#39;t <em>just</em> doing it to test the Lancer pair&#39;s patience. Bill would fill a twinge of regret at even poking fun at the other Master.

Lachlan&#39;s steps did not go unnoticed, and they did not go unpunished. Swift judgement was delivered against Lachlan&#39;s lapdog, the Servant in question delivering it growling in turn before steadying his staff beneath Lachlan&#39;s nose. 

&quot;This is a war, not some game of chicken. Try me again, and this is going through your head. <strong>Beat it.</strong> I couldn&#39;t give two shits who your Servant is, just like I know you don&#39;t give two shits who I am. All I need to tell you is this. <strong>One more step, and I will kill you.</strong>&quot;

The change in the air, in the tension between the two parties had changed, just as much as Lancer&#39;s perception had changed as he watched the undead continue to fall around them. Could his opponent be that strong that mere steps could destroy the undead around them? No...not if it could fall so easily to a simple strike. But, it was better to show strength and resolve early, especially if this was a foe that meant harm. Besides, the smug look on their face was annoying. 

A nod of his head towards Marcus was enough to gesture him behind him. Christopher wasn&#39;t the smartest tool on the shed, but he was far from dumb. Something wasn&#39;t right, not with how brazen this master was...

Something was wrong. With the reach of the being next to Lachlan, some of them shouldn’t have been able to be reached. 

Unless the servant hid away elsewhere.

Before Marcus could make further remarks Lancer took into motion. “Eh I would, but my cig just burnt out, kid idle chat is over. The big bad wolf doesn’t like to be known.” Adding insult to injury he flicked the cigarette butt towards Lachlan and the behemoth next to him. 

“You’re one of two brats. Of course I’d want to be proactive and get whoever was participating first. You all are a threat, simple as that.” The coroner didn’t move. Instead staying deathly still in the shadow of Christopher. Face now shrouded completely, a glint of metal in the night was in his hand. “You just made a fatal error. You met an Adler in a Graveyard.” 

“I’ll handle the brat. Don’t waste your breath on him. Be careful, I think that thing is just a puppet.” 

“Arms. Drag down.” 

Mana surged forth as a spell was cast. Lachlan’s blatant disregard of stepping on a grave was now going to bit him in the ass as pairs of skeletal arms shot up from the freshly repacked dirt. Wrapping themselves around his ankles, arms, shoulders, all trying to find purchase on his body. Forcing the boy to the ground. Threatening to push the puppeteer right into the dirt, and suffocate him 6 feet below. Tearing into clothes and ripping slightly into his flesh. As they repeatedly clawed and pressed themself into the skinwalker. 

It was wonderfully cinematic for the necromancer. Perhaps he would be allowed to have some fun tonight.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095171342233522289 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095171342233522289><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 10, 2023 9:19 PM">9:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or was their overwhelming confidence and self-serving superiority simply the pinnacle of what a magus family should display? Bill didn&#39;t get it, for he was nothing but a peasant. All he knew was that he felt a small tinge of satisfaction as the wolfman did exactly what he had feared: Actually made a move for once. If they were a Servant, it was obvious that common defenses would not work against them. They showed that plenty by penetrating Lachlan&#39;s offense and making it look like a shoddy defense instead. The &#39;Servant&#39; was quickly beaten, a strong strike shattering its visage and revealing its true form. Part of its leather started to fall off, revealing the true, disfigured form of the creature within. They were human. The flesh was, at least. But whatever construct was standing in Christopher&#39;s face had long since ceased to be a person in flesh and blood.

Despite that, they were not a Servant. Lancer could sense the weight of mana around him, but that did not come from Lachlan&#39;s puppet. It was a mere decoy, for corpses still started falling while it was incapacitated. It couldn&#39;t be Lachlan either, since he was currently being held by Marcus. Therefore-

The wolf&#39;s eyes flashed as they realized something strange. There were injuries on the puppet, injuries that were not due to surgery or Magecraft, nor were they caused by his staff. A gaping hole could be seen around its weight, blood slowly trickling from it.

Christopher then felt cold. Sickly. Something warm drooled from his chest and he noticed that his armor had been poked through. Then he saw a flash of light-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095443745220071475 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095443745220071475><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 3:22 PM">3:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class=chatlog__attachment><audio class=chatlog__attachment-media controls><source src="discord_assets/Who_Did_That_To_You_John_Legend-B354A.mp3" alt="Audio attachment" title="Audio: Who_Did_That_To_You_John_Legend.mp3 (7 MB)"></audio></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095443778061488200 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095443778061488200><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 3:22 PM">3:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>BANG!</em>

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

Several more holes appeared on the puppet, bullets poking through as they pierced the skin and emerged from the other side, aiming to do the same to Christopher. Were he a lesser Servant, perhaps this attack would have worked, but the trick was now revealed as he sensed all contours and positions of the bullets surrounding him. Three, four, five.

<em>Six,</em> if he counted the one bullet that hit its mark. A great shame for a saint to bear. They had used the puppet&#39;s own body to mask the bullet, but that wasn&#39;t the full extent of it. Something else had been used to hide that first projectile, something that could wait till later.

After all, his opponent had just given themselves away.

&quot;Well, ain&#39;t that a fancy trick.&quot;

The murky fog started to shape into something a bit more distinct. Black shapes and surroundings that had blended into one were now segregating into different pieces. There was the starry sky, the pitch black graveyard, the charcoal trees.

And then there was a man. A bastard with a pitch black heart, draped in shadows and filled with unrighteous fury.

<strong>Cherokee Bill</strong> took the stage, his coat flapping the cold night wind as he twirled his gun around his hands. His eyes gave him away, glowing bright in the darkness as he visibly snarled at Christopher from afar. It was clear that he hadn&#39;t expected the wolfman to still be alive.

<em>clap clap</em>

&quot;Two claps for you, Fido. Thought a fella like you would be better off chasing after graveyard bones, but maybe you&#39;re actually worth something.&quot; Bill joked, bouncing off his initial failure. He then lifted his hat and shook it, six bullets coming out. He thrust his gun into them mid-air and then, like a magician, they were put in place. He had reloaded.

&quot;Care to try that again?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095443831920525324 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095443831920525324><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 3:22 PM">3:22 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill&#39;s gun was already pointed at its target. He was revealed, but not fully exposed. Not only had the darkness obscured him, but also masked his position: It was only after Bill had revealed himself that Christopher realized his opponent was around a hundred feet away from him. Shooting at long range was the mark of a true gunman.

Plus, it&#39;s not like Lancer wasn&#39;t out of the woodworks either: The puppet still twitched and trembled, despite its belly looking like Swiss cheese. Lachlan might be busy, but who knew how autonomous his puppets could truly be? It was easy for a Servant to dispose of such a familiar, but to be distracted-

-Then again, Bill didn&#39;t <em>know.</em> He didn&#39;t know the secret behind his bullets failing.

<em>&lt;Boss, I know you like back massages, but even I find that excessive.&gt;</em> Bill quipped while Lachlan was being scratched at by a myriad of hands. <em>&lt;Don&#39;t make me play babysitter.&gt;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The outburst might have confused the Lancer pair, but Bill immediately knew that it was aimed at him as a few more messages nestled themselves into the back of his mind.

<em>&lt;What a shame, thought you were supposed to be the epitome of maternal instincts.&gt;</em>

Even telepathic communication wasn&#39;t enough to cut back the sarcasm in his remarks. Lachlan reached for his mental trigger, and his magic circuits flared to life as he uttered an incantation under his breath. 

The ground around his legs solidified, damp soil hardening into the consistency of compacted gravel. Sharp, scraping noises reaching his ears as the skeletal arms exerted themselves with renewed effort. But this time, the <strong>reinforced</strong> soil took longer to give, hindering their movements while grinding bits and pieces of flesh away as they struggled to move through the earth.

<em>&lt;Awe-inspiring marksmanship at display,&gt;</em> he found the time to appraise Bill after his first (failed) attempt at puncturing the Lancer with holes. <em>&lt;I&#39;m sure that bullet barely scratching his hide was your absolute best effort. Be a dear and focus on keeping the wolf off my trail, will you? Leave the magic tricks to me.&gt;</em>

With an obvious, practiced motion, Lachlan slipped his hand into his coat, feeling the familiar weight of his trusted seven-shooter as he closed his fingers around the metal. He had never shared the level of attachment to the weapon as Bill did, but as his finger found its place on the trigger, he knew it would serve its purpose all the same. 

All he had to do was lock onto the Coroner with his <strong>sight</strong>.

With a sharp pull of the hammer, he cocked the revolver, aligning a fresh round in the chamber. Without breaking his motion, he whipped his arm towards Marcus, the barrel of the gun pointed in his direction—

<em>BANG!</em>

—and fired mid-motion.

Lachlan&#39;s shot lacked the precision and finesse he had come to expect from a fellow gunman, with minimal effort put into aiming and accompanied by a reckless swing. 

However, as the silver nugget left its chamber, its trajectory would reveal a different story altogether. 

Marcus caught the glimpse of silver as it hurtled towards his face. Lancer, on the other hand, could tell from instinct alone that the bullet was aimed for his Master&#39;s mouth. But Bill, with his keen perception and years of experience, could already envision the devastating outcome if Marcus didn&#39;t take immediate action: the bullet piercing through the Coroner&#39;s cheek, shattering teeth and searing his tongue as it exited from the other side.

&#39;See? Not another step. You have my promise.&#39; Lachlan replied to Lancer cheekily as he pulled back the hammer to reload another shot. &#39;Can&#39;t speak for my Servant though. He&#39;s a bit of a rebel, you see.&#39;

Behind him, the puppet that by all means should have been disabled sprung back to life, its pale, disfigured body rearing back with unnatural movements. Elongated arms dug into the earth, wrestling with the skeletal arms as it worked to free its master from the pit.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095471616521162873 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095471616521162873><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 5:13 PM">5:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They too have access to magecraft, in any regards of the word.

Bullets also flew. The enemy servant revealed himself. Showing the coroner&#39;s hunch to be correct. Yet, Christopher remained unscathed, and allowing him for the potential of pursuit. &quot;Show em your strength.&quot; 

The Necromancer&#39;s attention was just momentarily taken away from the puppeteer. Allowing for him to wiggle a gun free from its holster. 

A familiar <em>click</em> then <strong>BANG</strong> followed. 

Like most untrained gunmen, it was definitely a shoddy shot. Something Marcus could tell after years of witnessing the aftermath of gunfire. Either with a corpse on his table or a body in the OR. It was never well placed, or well aimed. Just simply looking too inflict as much harm on another human with as little force necessary. 

In a quick moment the man&#39;s face stiffened. Undergoing the effects of his own Rigor Mortis. As it braced for the impact of the bullet. The vigor of the arms slowing as the puppet worked.

Tearing through flesh then meeting the bone beneath it was soon halted before it could finish its entire course through the Necromancer&#39;s face. Burning pain shot through his face and warm blood filled his mouth. He could only bear it for the time being. 

His jaw was most definitely broken. In response he could only let it fall limp, as limply as it could for being under the effects of his spell, blood pouring out. Along with spitting out the bullet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095516631008030720 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095516631008030720><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 8:11 PM">8:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The man&#39;s hand then held itself against the wound.&quot;Jaw.

The mana signature never faltered, not even once, and yet he had laid the creature flat with a single strike. 

Of course, such an observation was obvious once he felt the spreading warmth in his chest. The spray of dulled blood from the creature seemed to come seconds after the shot was already lodged within his chest. His armor, tempered leather stretched across his breast, was only able to stop a fraction of its penetrative power. But it was clear. It was a bullet. Metal lodged in his chest, still hot from the expulsion from a heated chamber. 

Same as the 5 that punched through the warped flesh of Lachlan&#39;s monstrosity, all aimed to pierce through his body again.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Bullets...don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s an Archer...</em>

The slightest nod of his head let one graze past his ear. A slight shift on his foot saw two more whizz straight through the open space between his chest and forearm. And two more flew past his hips, shooting into his cloak and causing the garment to flounder in the wind, all while Lancer&#39;s pale blue eyes caught sight of his true opponent, hiding in the deep shadow of the cemetery. 

&quot;...&quot; 

A pincer maneuver. It wasn&#39;t cockiness, it was a premeditated assault. Even without knowing who he was, they had created a plan of action to catch Servant and Master unaware, leaving them as the cornered ones despite the army at Marcus&#39;s disposal. Even with his own preparations, they were at a clear disadvantage and put on the backfoot, as the Master had shot his own through the cheek. Was it simply good luck? No...he&#39;d already seen quite enough to know that this Master didn&#39;t rely on luck. They came here with the express purpose of both Marcus and Lancer dying. And he had the distinct know how to put that into action. He wanted to come across as naive and foolish...or rather, he relied on that aspect of himself. Marcus now had a grave injury, and judging from the disgusting clicking from the monstrosity Lancer had laid low, he didn&#39;t just have to worry about the Servant across the way...

The odds were stacked. 

Just how he liked it. 

&quot;...Master. Marcus. I can handle this Servant. <strong>Easily</strong> I might add. But unfortunately, I can&#39;t afford to watch over you, which is exactly what this little pissant is expecting. So, I&#39;m going to tell you this right now...&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s voice was hoarse and husky, his own breath slightly labored as a bit of blood ebbed from the hole in his chest. It wasn&#39;t fatal, but it stung his pride more than anything. The enemy had caught him unaware...but that was the only time he would. 

&quot;I value strength. Above all, it is the only metric that I have any respect for. So listen carefully.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;This Master is seeking to battle you one on one. A test of who deserves this battle more. This is your first test. If you lose...<strong>you are not my Master.</strong> It will prove that this Dowling is more worthy than you. In which case, he will show true strength. And I will follow him instead.&quot; 

His eyes glowered as his pupils dilated, honing in on the figure in the distance that was wrapped in wreathing shade. They reloaded, and were prepared to make their next onslaught count. They needed to lose Lancer. Become lost in the shadow once again. The only reason he was able to dodge those other bullets was because he was made aware of them. The pain from the first one was a warning, but not one that this Servant planned on giving him. Which meant one thing: they were not prepared for Lancer. Or at least, they didn&#39;t know how he was able to dodge those projectiles. And this would be a battle to figure out each other&#39;s strength. &quot;...Servant! That means, no matter the outcome, you are in grave danger. Either your Master falls, and you lose your attachment to the World...or I kill you and take your place. But I&#39;ll simplify it for you, since I&#39;m just some dumb Fido. <strong>If I catch you, you will die.</strong> And I want you to be sure to know that that&#39;s not a threat...that&#39;s a promise. If you want to see my trick again, go ahead and fire. But like your Master, you&#39;d better make every shot count.&quot; 

Lancer lifted his staff, only to slam it&#39;s tip down into the earth, puncturing and digging into the autonomous puppet with a squelch of flesh. Lancer then lifted it up, the mass of limbs squirming like a spider suspended from the tip of a needle, Lancer&#39;s massive strength barely even used but clearly demonstrated as he reared his arm back and flung the puppet towards Lachlan&#39;s Servant. If anything, it was clear this was to make good on that promise. 

&quot;Let&#39;s you and I play a <em>real</em> game of chicken.&quot; Lancer walked forward, leaving both Masters to face each other. He found his sport.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095546606683697204 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095546606683697204><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 11, 2023 10:11 PM">10:11 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The wolf was still standing and his Master was unamused by his efforts, making the outlaw almost wish that Marcus had succeeded in snapping the brat&#39;s neck.

<em>&lt;You&#39;re about two seconds from wearing that smile of yours up your ass.&gt;</em> Bill laughed, with a tinge of menace attached to those words. It seemed to be a mere outburst as he was quick to prod his Master&#39;s mind again.

<em>&lt;And your aim makes me think you&#39;re a pacifist. Must be nice having your gun think for you.&gt;</em> He said on a whim, catching Lachlan off guard. <em>&lt;Oh well, I don&#39;t judge. What I&#39;ll say though is make those shots count: I&#39;m busy with Fido over here dogging after my ass.&gt;</em>

The link severed as Bill focused back on Christopher, noticing that the Lancer had already made their move. They pierced through the puppet with their staff, displaying overwhelming strength as they tossed it at Archer like some sort of human projectile. It was slow and lumbering, but just a mere diversion to cover for Lancer&#39;s next attack. Bill was no fool, for he would have done the same from that position.

&quot;You&#39;re real cute when you&#39;re actin&#39; all pissed like that, doggo.&quot; Bill sneered, ducking and rolling out of the way of the incoming puppet. He then stopped his momentum on a nearby tree, leaning on it as he took back aim. 

&quot;Here, play fetch.&quot;

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

Three bullets aimed straight for Christopher&#39;s wolf mane, two for his eyes and one for the skull. Bill observed from a distance, knowing that it wouldn&#39;t work: The damned mutt had even dared him to shoot back, no different than the sheriffs and deputies attempting to rile him up into committing mistakes.

Once again, Lancer was able to dodge the bullets with ease, seeing them like snowflakes frozen in the sky. They whizzed past him with just a few movements, something that would strike fear in the heart of any gunslinger. What good was a gun if it could never hit its target?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095816095375577189 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095816095375577189><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 4:01 PM">4:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But Bill was not afraid. He stared intently, expecting something to happen. Was he awaiting a sign of God? The Great Spirit of the Cherokee? The bastard just smiled.

&quot;Adios, <em>ukashana.</em>&quot;

<em>ba-zing!</em>
<em>crack</em>

A loud noise penetrated Christopher&#39;s fluffy ears. He would not have time to turn around, so he didn&#39;t see it. But Bill&#39;s plan had already bore fruit: His bullets were expertly dodged...and had collided right with a bunch of tombstones, hitting at the perfect angle to ricochet back at Lancer, aiming for the wolf&#39;s back. An impossible calculation of trajectories while simultaneously accounting for Christopher&#39;s position several steps into the future. No wonder they were a Servant. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill&#39;s jeering didn&#39;t faze Lachlan in the slightest. Even though the impact of his bullet had been severely dampened, he had managed to gather valuable intel from the brief exchange. It was more than just the physical result of the shot, but rather the validation of his conjectures, and the satisfaction of unraveling a puzzle with his own hands.

Verbal commands.

Marcus, much like the many mages he&#39;d come to know, relied on verbal commands to channel their magecraft. It was a flaw in the design: intentions made clear by words, which can be exploited in the right circumstances.

But of course, such nuances would fail to penetrate his Servant&#39;s thick skull.

<em>&lt;Thought you&#39;d have learned a thing or two about mages from tangoing with my Skinwalkers, but apparently, I was mistaken.&gt;</em> Lachlan&#39;s words filtered into Bill&#39;s mind. Try as he might to dismiss them, but they hung ever so close, like the irritating buzzing of a fly. 

<em>&lt;You can&#39;t shut down magecraft completely without cutting off the source, but are you aware how many types of magecraft can continue to work even after its user&#39;s death?&gt;</em>

One more word and Bill might feel tempted to blast a few rounds into the redheaded runt, the Holy Grail be damned!

<em>&lt;But of course, all you can do is rely on your <strong>brute force</strong>, hoping that every creature wears their weakness on their heart. Quite the one-trick pony, aren&#39;t you?&gt;</em>

That stopped Bill in his tracks. Lachlan&#39;s words stung, and Bill had ever right to suspect that the brat knew it would. He had been observing not just Marcus, but their Servants as well. Being in close proximity to the both of them had given him a front-row seat to all the spectacles that Lancer had been putting on full display. 
<em> </em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095869743099035658 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095869743099035658><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 7:35 PM">7:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>And he wasn&#39;t afraid to rip off the band-aid for his own Servant.

With a grunt, Lachlan pulled his legs out of the death pit. Try as the zombies might to drag him back down, their own forces were being uprooted by both his puppet and Lancer&#39;s actions. The once-buried mass of flesh, soil, and bones had become dislodged amidst the struggle, and as Lancer lifted up the puppet, an entangled mass of zombies followed, raining down around them before regrouping with their brethren above ground.

Lachlan regarded the Coroner with a smug grin as they both received Lancer&#39;s ultimatum. &#39;I suppose a word of thanks is in order? Quite the noble Servant you&#39;ve got there. Can&#39;t say I dislike the way he does things, though. I&#39;m <em>all</em> for rewarding good work.&#39; 

He took a few steps back the way he came, his eyes scanning the horde of zombies and estimating their speed of approach. &#39;Though, I have to ask. How accurate are those movies? Think I can outrun them? I mean, I&#39;m only twenty and in peak condition, and I&#39;ve brought neither a bumbling sidekick or a romantic couple to raise a death flag over my own head.&#39;

Lachlan hastened his steps, trying to rile up Marcus as he continued to talk like an overconfident brat. He wanted to keep the Coroner&#39;s attention on him, just a few more seconds, a few more precious seconds&#39; of distraction, with the chaos of the zombie horde masking the scuttling sounds coming from behind—

And in a sudden flurry of movement, a dark shadow leapt over the tombstones. It moved with uncanny speed, all eight of its limbs plowing the earth in excitement as they closed in on the Coroner. It was a ghastly sight, the creature&#39;s skin pale and patched together with crude stitching to create a larger form, no longer resembling a human, but that of an arachnoid. The mismatched flesh and sinew stretched and strained as it moved, with bony protrusions jutting out at odd angles on its segmented limbs.

Lancer making himself clear once again. Strength is all he respected. Something Marcus would have to show, time and time again. Push his old withered form to the brink and then some. It was part of their contract, in exchange for a wish, he required near annihilation of his master’s well-being. It was only fair. 

Words were still tough for the coroner to form as his jaw mended itself. Piece by broken piece. It was a clever move by the brat, get rid of a mage’s voice and they are usually dead meat. 

The pit of death now less animated as the puppeteer lurched free from its grasp. Thanks to both his own servant and the abomination at his side. 

“I doubt you’ll do any better with Lancer.” The stiffness remained in his jaw as its final pieces mended whole again. “Depends on the film. Gotta love a good B rated horror flick, after all.” 

Without being in the shadow of Lancer’s massive form, the pale moonlight made Marcus appear as if he could fit in neatly with his horde of undead minions. Knife brandished at his side like a killer, a dark stain on his face where he was shot. “You know they never kill off the spoiled brat. At least not one of the first to die. Slasher flicks however, your luck won’t hold up. The twinks are always the first to go there.” 

Something was off, the Lachlan spoke purposefully. As if to distract the necromancer from something else, something muffled by the horde of undead which surrounded both he and the puppeteer. That was until he brazenly announced the surprise. 

Another puppet emerged from behind. Leaping forth and attempting to entangle the Necromancer. With barely enough time to twist his body and raise the knife up to meet the creature of living flesh. Rigor Mortis setting upon the arm as the knife dug right into its skin, digging deeper and deeper as the creature forced itself into a hug with the ex surgeon. He could only hope that it’ll keel over or pull itself away from his body.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095909664098619482 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095909664098619482><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 10:13 PM">10:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>While his arm remained stiff against the force of the ‘leapfrog’ his other limbs still kept their full ranges of movement. “Clever little creature.

The necromancer took a step to the side, moving towards his pile of accumulated bones. A slight sweat forming on his brow as he moved. It was still a struggle to keep this things weight at bay, before reaching his pile. 

A quick look he then kicked a vertebrae towards Lachlan. “Vertebrae. Entangle.” 

The three vertebrae then began to grow a spinal cord along with additional vertebrae. As they flew towards the puppeteer. It was a unique form of necromancy at work.

Bill rolled to the side, easily dodging the lumpy, writhing gaggle of flesh before unloading three more bullets. They fluttered in the air before him as they came within eyeline, Christopher slightly amazed at how pinpoint they really were. At their trajectory, they&#39;d pierce right through his skull. He felt a little sorry for whatever Servant would have had to face him. But, no other Servant would ever have to. 

His head ducked low, bullets grazing through his fur and past his cheeks, with the third just barely skidding across his scalp as he continued his march. 

<em>He&#39;s around 90 feet now...if I sprint, I can corner him. He doesn&#39;t know the full extent of my power. If anything, he&#39;ll simply think I&#39;m just fast enough to react, which will cause him to get more and more reckless. Take more risks. If I keep this up, I can get him to slip up, and then distance won&#39;t be a factor. He doesn&#39;t know about the Staff yet either, which means I-</em>

They were coming back. 

All three, aimed straight for his back. Two within his shoulder blades, and another in the base of his skull. What the hell, how did this Servant pull that off? Could they control their bullets? No...no, if that were the case, they would have done that from the start. Lancer took a quick glance behind, shocked to see the crumbled gravestone with three smoking indentations. Ricochets?

&quot;Dammit...you have to be an Archer, that&#39;s the only way you could pull off something so annoying,&quot; 

Lancer ducked low, letting all three bullets pass over him and fall into the clearing between them, all the while keeping his eyes trained on Bill in the distance. Bastard...with so much distance, this wasn&#39;t about fighting. It seemed they were just as precise as their Master...<strong>they were trying to figure out Lancer&#39;s ability.</strong>

&quot;...Heh. Did it really annoy you how easily I was able to dodge? You&#39;re thinking it&#39;s some kind of special power?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

```Christopher stood tall once more, staff gripped tightly in his hand as he walked forward. The nape of his neck throbbed...his chest pounded. Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be so easy...<strong>good.</strong>

&quot;Well, I think you&#39;re forgetting one important thought, Servant. Maybe...you&#39;re just not as good of a shot as you think you are.&quot; 

Grass flew, and dirt billowed behind Lancer as he put on a burst of speed. His cloak furled wildly behind him, giving him the image of a wisp as his staff lighted its tip into the earth. From behind, a wall of dust crested high above Lancer and followed his every move, doing all to obscure the Staff in his hand...

<em>If he wasn&#39;t sure before, he&#39;ll be certain now. He&#39;ll know I have some kind of power to avoid his shots. He&#39;ll keep experimenting...try to maintain distance, even if it&#39;s minimal. And he won&#39;t suspect that my reach is far longer than he thinks it is.</em>

80 Feet. 76 Feet. Lancer was getting closer, and his patience wearing thin.

With a quick swerve, merely 20 feet apart, Lancer cut across the field between he and Bill as a cloud of dust rolled in, obscuring the Saint completely. Bill could even hear the faintest chirp of crickets in the silence that followed.

Before Lancer burst through to his right, jaws outstretched and Staff ready to swing at his head to knock it off of his shoulders in one blow.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 11:27 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095921760853041265 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095921760853041265><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 11:01 PM">11:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t hard to cover the distance between him and Bill, especially for a protector of travelers. He knew that too, hence why he started to belittle the underprepared Archer.

&quot;So long as you lie dead at my feet,&quot; Bill replied with a smirk. &quot;then all those missed shots will have been worth it. They say all dogs have their day, don&#39;t they? Well, your days are about to run out.&quot; He took aim once more, daring the Lancer to approach.

<em>&quot;Fucking cocksucker.&quot;</em> In reality, Bill felt quite frustrated. His specialty was to kill those weaker than him, not heroes of old that had wolves for heads. He would never admit that to Lachlan, of course, who was currently barraging him with more insults.

<em>&lt;Magic after the user dies, you say? Good. At least you&#39;ll still be of some use after you&#39;ve kicked the bucket. Try to die hard now, will you sweetie?&gt;</em> He tossed an insult right back at them, noticing the appearance of another puppet, albeit one far more impressive than the rest. Impressively revolting.

<em>&lt;Great Spirit...I&#39;d say Hell is too kind for you folk.&gt;</em> He commented, remembering what exactly Lachlan&#39;s puppets were. He tossed that thought aside as he attempted to refocus on the fight at hand. His Master could take care of himself.

<em>&quot;Three bullets left.&quot;</em> He stared at his gun, taking aim at Lancer in the distance. <em>&quot;I could reload, but then his jaws would probably be at my throat. I could back off, but then what? Fucking running away from a mutt till the end of days? Bah.&quot;</em>

He kept pointing his gun, but did not fire. It was far too risky to waste his shots and end up being defenseless against the wolf. He waited for his target to get closer, and closer...

Eventually, Lancer picked up the pace, creating a cloud of dust and a whirlwind of grass that caused the Servant to vanish in the night air. Bill was befuddled, staring dumbfounded like a child that had candy stolen from them. The world went silent for a bit. If he planned on retreating, it was now or never.

Yet Bill stood his ground, putting his back on a tree instead as the dust surrounded him. All around he could see hungry, canine eyes and ears, waiting to pounce on him. Christopher finally pounced out, teeth agape and staff at the ready, aiming to hit at Archer&#39;s head sideways.

&quot;Tch.&quot; Bill moved through reactions alone, his body bristling the moment he sensed a disturbance in the dust. Instead of stepping back from the attack, he lunged forward, much to Lancer&#39;s surprise. Was he aiming to fight him head on?

No, he was still dodging, just with a calculated risk: Bill threw himself forward, taking a dive as he slid across the ground with his arms sprayed forward, fingers still wrapped around his gun. The staff whizzed past him, since he was currently lying prone on the dirt and right next to Lancer&#39;s feet.

&quot;Gotcha, you filthy animal!&quot; He cackled, raising his gun upward so that it pointed to the sky.

..And right towards Lancer&#39;s groin.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

All three bullets fired, less than a meter away from their target. Even if he was capable of dodging, surely Christopher would be unable to walk away unscathed?! <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite its impressive speed, Leapfrog was ill-equipped for defense. Though its skin had been fortified against wear and tear, it fell apart like paper in front of Marcus&#39; Mystic Code. Unlike the rigidity of his zombies, what he encountered was supple flesh and steamy, pulsing blood, flowing through veins and staining his clothes as it dripped from the gash.

The puppet was alive, in its own twisted way. Though the Coroner had always suspected this fact, now that he had finally gotten his hands on a specimen, he was more certain than ever. 

However, as he continued to explore the wound, a new realization dawned on him. The resistance his knife had met was not in the way he had expected. Instead of piercing vital organs, all it had encountered so far was a jumbled mess of bone and sinew, an unsightly perversion of the human anatomy he had painstakingly memorized during his years as a doctor.

And perhaps, it was precisely due to his experience that his approach had been flawed from the start. The puppet looming over him was not simply a distorted human form, but could be considered an entirely new species with its own unique anatomy. His knowledge as a doctor had worked against him, leading him to make assumptions that seemed to not apply to the creature.

The saving grace, perhaps, was that despite its arachnoid form, the puppet lacked the usual deadly features of a spider. There were no venomous fangs to worry about. Instead, it seemed to rely on its <strong>limbs</strong> to physically restrict him, pinning him down and trying to asphyxiate him in a slow, but agonizing death.

<em>rattle rattle</em>

Several paces removed from Marcus&#39; ongoing struggle, the &#39;spoiled brat in a B rated horror flick&#39; was in a predicament of his own. The vertebrae snaked towards him, their movement hidden by the frenzy of the stampeding zombies. 

He didn&#39;t notice until was too late.

The sudden restraint caused him to stumble, and his movements came to an abrupt halt. The bones dug into his flesh, and even as he tried to pry them off, they only wound tighter and tighter, threatening to cut off the blood circulation from his legs.

All the while, the zombies poured in, their slack-jawed faces contorted into grotesque expressions as they finally caught up with their prey.

&#39;Great analysis, doctor,&#39; Lachlan called out as he lay on the ground, thinking fast. &#39;Looks like your predictions are spot on.&#39; He cast a glance around, searching for the equally prone form of the Coroner. It seemed that both Masters had gotten themselves into a contest of attrition, a race against time to see who would succumb first. 

However, the thought of himself being torn to shreds was decidedly less amusing than watching Marcus kick the bucket.

&#39;Looks like I&#39;ll have to switch genres, then.&#39;

Lachlan fumbled for his revolver, before aiming it towards the sky and firing three shots in quick succession. He then waited, lying on his back, watching the zombies lunge at him with their decaying arms and counting down the seconds...

<em>SLASH!</em>

The arm of the closest zombie went flying, following by the head of another. A third slash spliced a zombie from midsection to groin, spilling their guts and leaving them in a useless heap on the ground. A dark shadow descended upon Lachlan, shielding him like a dome from the encroaching undead.

The Dancer had returned. Its stomach now full of holes, the once pristine figure now moved on all fours like a feral beast, using its sharp claws to tear down any zombie that dared approach its master. 

Lachlan twirled the revolver in his hand. <em>&lt;Good boy,&gt;</em> he praised the Dancer, as the latter responded with a snarl, its movements becoming even more precise as it attacked the zombies with renewed ferocity.

The dust blowing from his attack only passed as a second veil to Bill&#39;s own counter. Which wasn&#39;t as much a counterattack, as much as a display of public humiliation against the Lancer.  3 more bullets, aimed at his boys and lance. 

And there wasn&#39;t much time before they&#39;d bend the knee. And him. Which meant something had to be done fast, and it had to be drastic. 

Before the bullets could even think of grazing his loins, Lancer&#39;s staff sprung to life and lifted the wolf above Bill, the Saint using the momentum to perch at the top. He peered down at the Archer, now laid flat for the Lancer, spread out on a practical platter. 

&quot;Well...here we are.&quot; 

And that was all he needed. 

The staff shrank, and Lancer swung the staff above his head, falling towards Bill and waiting to slam the tip into the Archer&#39;s Skull.

At least that was Marcus’s thought process as blood spilled onto him. 

This would be an easy operation. Reach the heart. And cut it loose. 

Yet it was his training that seemed to misguide his blade. As this thing was a mockery of the human form. Confirming his theories, but also confusing his methods for dealing with the beast. An interesting predicament as its arms continued to wrap and entangle. 

The anatomy was wrong. Muscle and bone was where viscera should have been housed. A confused sense of anatomy. Meant for little more than function rather than life. Entrapping his knife in the network of sinew, muscle, and bone. His arm remaining stiff and firm against the creature’s mass.

With his still freed arm, he blindly reached for whatever he could get a hold of. Finally hand settling upon a rib he collected earlier. 

Just as his other arm was enhanced, so did this one. Striking upwards with a greater force than he was capable of producing alone. Burying the rib in the side of the creature. 

“Ribs. Expand.” The coroner managed to speak. Using the last bit of air he could manage. Several sets of ribs began to grow inside the creature threatening to tear open its form, and free the necromancer from an untimely demise. 

While the Zombies were an easier threat to deal with, their sheer mass was still concerning. Corpse after corpse still following the order it was given. To Kill Lachlan. 

Yet with the presence of the Dancer it was easier to manage their number. Aside from a few tougher specimens amongst their ranks. Enhanced by some means. They continued their onslaught.

Bill watched the dog do a nice little trick, planting their staff on the ground and extending it, raising them high up as the bullets flew past them and into the night sky. They vanished like shooting stars, twinkling once or twice before they were gone.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Archer said, astonished. Part of him felt like he should have expected that, the other was raging inside. What sort of stick could extend at will? Why would a wolfman have such an item in the first place?!

Not like he could be blamed, considering how devoid of Mystery Bill himself was. To fight against actual mythical opponents was essentially a fantastical fever dream to him. Christopher seemed equally amused, though Bill didn&#39;t find that flattering at all. The Lancer could have attacked him at any point, but instead chose to say a few words before their strike.

<em>&quot;Well...here we are.&quot;</em>

He would have rather heard nothing at all. His trigger finger was bristling with rage. This type of powerlessness was one that he hadn&#39;t experienced in years. No, a decade. The type of rage a son feels when beaten by their father. Complete and utter domination.

Christopher then struck, raising their staff and attempting to once again go for the head. Bill was still lying on the ground, motionless. His gun arm was down and he still clenched his pistol tight. The air got heavy and arid, the staff now moments away from colliding. A tumbleweed rolled past the two, marking curtains for Bill.

<em>grip</em>

Instead of holding on to his gun for his dear life, Bill let it go. His gloved hands gripped the sand underneath them instead, while his free arm dug deeper into his groin much to Christopher&#39;s surprise. A familiar rattling could be heard as something escaped from the cowboy&#39;s waist.

<em>BANG!</em>

&quot;I got <em>two</em>, <strong>motherfucker!&quot;</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096532550136103062 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096532550136103062><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 3:28 PM">3:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill&#39;s second pistol made its entrance, identical to the first with a slightly different sheen. Instead of aiming for Christopher, he had aimed towards the staff, shooting a bullet to slow down its impact, and then-

<em>BANG! BANG!</em>

-Shooting several more bullets in an attempt to parry it, like a swordsman would do with a claymore. Never before had Lancer seen a man attempt to use projectiles like a sword or shield. It was impossible for an archer to do so with a bow and arrow: It would have taken too much time to string the bow. The aim would have also needed to be perfect and hit the staff in key locations. At that point, one was better off using their flesh and bone to tank the blow.

But not Bill. Every bullet was concentrated, aimed at key locations on the staff to push Christopher back and make him lose his balance. He didn&#39;t expect to destroy it, of course, since there was no doubt of it being a Noble Phantasm, but it bought him precious seconds. Enough time for Bill&#39;s other arm to raise up and open its fist.

<em>pssst</em>

The cowboy tossed up a cloud of sand at the wolf, filling the Servant&#39;s eyes with insidious grains. Normally, this wouldn&#39;t have mattered, but something about the sand felt off. It was irritating and persistent, like something desperately clinging to a world that it did not belong to. Lancer couldn&#39;t quite pinpoint why, until he took a step back and his arm collided with something sharp. If he were to turn around, he would notice that the tree that Bill had been leaning on a few minutes ago had now changed into a meaty cactus.

What exactly was going on?

<em>step step</em>

Bill took full advantage of that confusion, grabbing the gun that he had dropped and making distance. He was now a dozen meters or so away from Christopher, but knew for a fact that the wolf could catch up to him in a second if he so willed it. Regardless, this was progress in his eyes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096532597779218492 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096532597779218492><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 14, 2023 3:29 PM">3:29 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
After all, he had just caught Christopher into his own <em>Noble Phantasm.</em>

&quot;Give it up, you persistent mutt. You&#39;re not getting me or my Master&#39;s head.&quot; Bill said, catching his breath as he unloaded his guns and spat bullets into the chambers, reloading them in just a second. The casings touched the sand below, which had replaced the graveyard&#39;s grassy terrain. Clearly, something had changed around here. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even as their brethren fell to the Dancer&#39;s fierce attacks, more of them flooded in, plugging the holes in their ranks with sheer numbers. They poured over the top of the ever-growing pile of corpses, scratching and biting at whatever they could reach.

The pressure on the Dancer continued to mount. As Lachlan&#39;s bodyguard, it naturally drew the brunt of the zombies&#39; attention. No matter how quickly its claws lashed out, a few zombies still managed to slip through the gaps, reaching the bullet wounds across its torso. The puppet howled in pain as its wounds were torn open once again. Recoiling from the fresh burst of pain, the fear of self-preservation clouding its once unwavering focus.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Was it going to get eaten alive. . . ?</code>

A vestige of the Dancer&#39;s former self awakened from the depths of its possessed mind. Lachlan, sensing the impact of this subtle change, promptly squashed it like a bug.

<em>&#39;Oh no you don&#39;t,&#39;</em> he whispered to the belabored figure shielding over him, his mind probing the puppet&#39;s and erasing what little free will that had begun to rear its ugly head. Self-preservation? Don&#39;t make him laugh. The Dancer was programmed with a single-minded purpose: to ensure its master&#39;s safety. It was designed to fight until the bitter end, sooner to become cannon fodder than to entertain the thought of running away. And if that meant yielding its own flesh to sate the zombies&#39; hunger, then it would do exactly that, with zero complaints.

Surely, going to Hell would be too merciful a punishment for his actions. For once, Bill might be right on the money. But would he let this scumbag have the last laugh?

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t you worry about a thing,&gt;</em> he said as the Dancer&#39;s body relaxed overhead, no longer bothered by the zombies&#39; abuse. <em>&lt;Everyone in the family&#39;s got their own VIP booth reserved down there. Unfortunately, you won&#39;t be seeing it just yet. Not if you croak before I do.&gt;</em>

With its formidable resistance, it would take quite a while for even the elite zombies to chew through such a thick slab of meat and reach the prize underneath. Perhaps, enough time for his other puppet to finish its job...

But alas, it seemed that Leapfrog had run headlong into a roadblock.

With a sickening sound of tearing fleshing, several sets of human-sized ribs began to expand inside the creature, splitting it open along the incision created by the knife. A gap burst down its midsection, forming a temporary breach that granted Marcus some precious breathing room. 

The puppet reacted by hugging Marcus even tighter, but the action only served to split its torso further. Eventually, the skin on its backside broke, allowing Marcus to push his arms out from its backside, like the wings of a moth emerging from a cocoon.

Fresh air, at last.

The process almost felt poetic, if not for the cacophony of moaning and growling emitted by the nearby zombies. Before him lay a grotesque mound of his own creation, bodies piled upon each other like a small mountain in the making. How many zombies were dead, and how many were still alive and trying to plow their way in? 

The Dancer and Lachlan were somewhere in that heap, buried several feet underneath. If they hadn&#39;t been devoured by the horde, then surely their sheer weight would have crushed them. Even now, with the majority of the graves overturned, a few stragglers were still making their way towards their prey.

But one zombie moved differently. Veering off course, shambling towards Marcus and Leapfrog. No commands seemed to break through to this rebel. It halted a scant few inches away from the two, close enough for them to smell the foul-smelling suds dripping off its body.

The dead dog-piled upon the Dancer and Lachlan. Tearing deeper and deeper into their feast of flesh. The wounded creature being unable to keep up with a once manageable mass of rotting flesh. Plus without the support of Archer&#39;s gun fire, things were not looking well for the puppet and its master. 

The mass of writhing flesh was loud. A cacophony of groans, and other unholy sounds allowed for Lachlan to slip away with relative ease. After-all, the zombies were now focused in on the chew toy which was the Dancer. A promising prospect to completely devour, if they didn&#39;t also inadvertently devour themselves in the process.  

Meanwhile the Coroner&#39;s own gambit paid off. 

The Ribs blossomed forth, expanding as if they were allowing for a breath of fresh air. Opening the Leapfrog in a beautifully twisted way. As if it were a flower in full bloom. Granting an opening for Marcus to pull himself through, as the creature attempted to only squeeze harder and harder. 

His head and arms emerged, soon followed by the rest of his now bloodied form. As if the necromancer were a chest burster from Alien. His trusted knife&#39;s shine was dulled in the moonlight. 

The man could only take in a deep breath of air. Having almost been killed by the threat of asphyxiation. There was only one thing he wanted to do. Smoke. 

So with his practiced motion a cigarette was produced and the bloodied blade was transformed into an equally viscera covered lighter. Illuminating his face in a grotesque manner. Now truly almost indistinguishable from his mass of undead. 

There was something peculiar occurring however. One Zombie slipped away from the dog-pile. One zombie who was not reacting to his most important spell when it came to the craft of necromancy. 

Then as if it was the dramatic reveal. Lachlan gripped the zombie face and tore it free. Throwing it at Marcus to add insult. 

With a wet <em>squelch</em>. It made contact with the Coroner&#39;s Form.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 5:16 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You have no clue.&quot; He simply brushed the face off, keeping himself facing towards Lachlan. 

&quot;If you&#39;re really concerned about petty things like that, you came to the wrong place.&quot; The Coroner then took a second drag, before pulling the cigarette from his mouth and letting it hang loosely in his free hand. &quot;Clever things by the way.&quot; His head tilted in acknowledgement of the currently flayed Leapfrog and pile of rotted meat which was burying the Dancer in the current moment. &quot;A real interesting way to twist anatomy. Barely keep them alive, arrange everything for function and care minimally about sustaining life. Kinda fucked up to keep them alive in all honesty. It&#39;d be much safer to just kill and reanimate.

Marcus&#39;s hand moved back up to his lips and another drag was taken from his cigarette. It was long and drawn out. The seconds seemed to go into an eternity.

His bullets slammed into the staff with such precision that it actually slowed its descent. Lancer veered off course, his eyes being dealt a swift cloud of sand that blinded him. He dug at his sockets, practically attempting to claw the granules away. Something was not right. 

Lancer swung in another arc around himself, trying to blindly catch Archer on the run, but all he received was a forearm embedded with spines and needles. That...was a cactus, that wasn&#39;t there before. 

&quot;...What the hell is this...?&quot; He mumbled to himself as he finally opened his eyes, watching Bill scurry away across an unfamiliar terrain. One far more flat and open, leaving the Lancer even more exposed. 

&quot;Okay...so we  both got secrets.&quot; The Saint once more hefted his Staff and let it lay across his shoulders, himself taking a moment to survey the landscape once more. On closer inspection, this wasn&#39;t so different from Canaan...but while he was familiar, something told him this was simply who Bill <em>was.</em> 

&quot;Something tells me you can show me a few more...&quot; 

&quot;Well, if you&#39;re that confident, I can only imagine that means you think you&#39;ve got me cornered. Or youre just talking tough. Either way, if you want a fire fight, why don&#39;t we see who&#39;s better.&quot; 

Lancer swung around, implanting his staff into the cactus and uprooting the entire plant. With a swing, he sent it into the air, before his biceps bulged against his armor and swung the staff around like a bat. An explosion of vegetation, and most importantly needles, flew towards Archer, with Lancer taking the opportunity to close the distance. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Such glee was short lived, as Lancer soon realized that not much had changed: Archer was still running away and Christopher was still in peak form. How could the Lachlan&#39;s Servant even hope to win?

&quot;I don&#39;t need to corner you to win.&quot; Cherokee Bill said without a fuss as he readied his guns. &quot;All me and my Master need to do is survive. Victory is obtained by those who live to tell the tale. I wouldn&#39;t mind your skull to be part of that, of course.&quot; He threatened and Lancer threatened back, swinging the cactus like some sort of ranged projectile before charging straight at their opponent.

&quot;I&#39;m not the one playing fetch here, Fido.&quot; Bill said with a chuckle as he suddenly holstered his guns. He shuffled through his pockets, before taking out a little souvenir that he had convinced Lachlan&#39;s slave to buy: A grenade.

<em>clic</em>

He pulled the pin, tilting his head to effortlessly dodge a flurry of cacti needles before tossing it right from his feet like a bowling ball. He gave no shits about being in its effective range, standing around 15 meters or so away from it. Coincidentally, Christopher had just reached the grenade&#39;s location.

&quot;Now boy...<strong>Fetch.&quot;</strong>

<em>KA-BOOM!</em>

Smoke, sand and shrapnel littered the graveyard as traces of cacti and gravestones flew up into the sky. Even Lachlan and Marcus could feel the aftereffects of that shock, albeit neither of them could do much about it. Marcus knew though that if Lancer was the type of Servant to keel over from a grenade, then he had summoned the wrong one.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097292139307728926 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097292139307728926><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 5:47 PM">5:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Of course a Knight Class Servant would not be defeated by such a weapon. Lacking in Mystery and in power, to Christopher it was no different than being hit by a firework. It stung a little, but barely any more than a prickly needle. It was unexpected, to see an Archer use a weapon that did not belong to them. A weapon that was used by common humans nonetheless. There was no doubt now that Bill was a modern Servant.

But the purpose of the grenade was not to kill: It was to create a blanket of smoke, wide enough for Bill to disappear into the shadows. By the time Lancer had regained his sight, the outlaw was gone, replaced by the cold, howling winds of the Wild West.

<em>&quot;Heh heh heh heh heh.&quot;</em> Nondescript cackling could be heard, like the hooting of a rooster crossed with the howls of a hyena. <em>&quot;Back to where we started...I&#39;m getting quite nostalgic.&quot;</em> Bill&#39;s voice echoed in the darkness, outside of Lancer&#39;s line of sight. The Archer was mocking him from a distance, but his voice felt like it was rebounding from the inside of a cave. Something was masking the sound of his lips, making him appear closer and further away than he truly was.

<em>&quot;The only difference is that I know your tricks now. You can teach a dog to sit and roll over, but it&#39;s a lot harder to teach it anything beyond that. How quick do you learn, Fido?&quot;</em>

Christopher then felt a familiar pain in his chest. If he looked down, he would find another hole in his stomach, gaping and round like the original bullet hole. He had been shot twice now.

<em>&quot;Hurts, doesn&#39;t it? Good. There&#39;s more where that came from. Just stay still a bit longer and I&#39;ll make it quick...&quot;</em> Bill laughed, his voice echoing throughout the graveyard before vanishing once more. 

Shame was overflowing in Christopher&#39;s body, how could he be so negligent-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097292202192932944 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097292202192932944><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 5:47 PM">5:47 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
No. It was not negligence, nor had he been surpassed: If Archer truly wanted him dead, then he would have aimed for the <strong>head.</strong> However, he didn&#39;t. There was only one reason for that:

<strong>Lancer would have seen the bullet coming.</strong>

The first bullet that hit was hidden by Lachlan&#39;s puppet. The second bullet hit while Christopher was distracted. Both were directed to the chest, because there was no doubt that Christopher would have seen a bullet headed straight for his eyes. Archer was acting all tough, but he also had little leeway: He couldn&#39;t kill Christopher in one fell swoop. He had to whittle him down, bit by bit, like a pickaxe on a boulder.

Granted, no shots came after that. Bill had wised up and realized that shooting repeated shots would have not only done nothing, but also given away his position. All the Archer needed to do now was shoot once, reload and reposition, then try again. Like a wolf, Lancer was being hunted in the night with barely any tools to work with. Bill had limitless chances to try and try again, until the wolf met its demise.

The bullets were soundless, odorless and there was no muzzle fire. Whatever Noble Phantasm Bill was using, it was masking the projectiles completely. But Lancer couldn&#39;t give up now. There had to be <em>some</em> way to make Archer slip. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Purposely dressing himself up as an elderly, lulling his opponents into a false sense of security. But now, with the Puppeteer fully within striking distance and distracted by his cigarette, Marcus was finally able to close in on his prey.

The Coroner lunged. 

Mallet in hand, he swung with all of his strength and aimed for Lachlan&#39;s skull. The cigarette drew an arc in the air, briefly illuminating Lachlan&#39;s wide-eyed face before it was snuffed out by the impact. 

Blood splattered across his face, hot and sticky. A sharp pain stabbed his wrist, while the sound of something cracking and breaking reached his ears. His hand throbbed as if it had hit something <em>and</em> been impaled on something simultaneously.

Then the world flipped upside down. Lachlan tackled him back and the two landed together, with Marcus sprawled face-up and Lachlan atop his chest.

&#39;It&#39;s always function over form for you Necromancers, eh, doctor?&#39; The puppeteer sneered, his <strong>dominant arm</strong> hanging limply at his side at an odd angle, evidently broken from trying to dampen Marcus&#39; blow. &#39;Why all the charade, then? Do you really think you can win with smoke breaks as your battle strategy? The same act won&#39;t work a second time.&#39;

In his other hand gripped a dagger, the tip of which buried deep in Marcus&#39; wrist from the force of his own swing. With a grunt, Lachlan twisted the blade, intending to inflict even more pain to the Coroner so he&#39;d drop the mallet. Or make him bleed out, whichever came first.

&#39;Walked right into that one, you did.&#39; He taunted through gritted teeth, trickles of blood running down his forehead. He must have been in an awful lot of pain as well. &#39;Should&#39;ve conjured something that&#39;s a bit more wieldy for someone your age. Really thought this War through, didn&#39;t you?&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097503210576552016 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097503210576552016><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 17, 2023 7:45 AM">7:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Blood smattered against Christopher&#39;s hands as he examined the fresh hole, his body faltering slightly as the dull ache that could only belong to a bullet puncturing your insides started to ebb. He could only guarantee a shot once...if Christopher can see the bullet, he&#39;d be able to dodge. That&#39;s why he wasn&#39;t just finishing him off...Archer couldn&#39;t. 

It seemed that they were both matched, each able to somewhat pierce through the defenses of the other. Archer&#39;s saving grace was his trickery though. He was willing to take out Lancer&#39;s staff before the dog himself, and put himself in the position of danger to do so. But only for so long. 

Nowhere in sight for him to strike, and nowhere for the Saint to turn to to figure out their location. No doubt they were also moving from their first location, so it wasn&#39;t like Christopher could go by the trajectory of his wound...as if he even could, what kind of stupid thought was that. 

It seemed like Archer did have one weakness at least. He saw it in the barest glint of his eye when they came face to face, the slight scowl that pulled at his lips as he aimed for the nether-regions of the Saint. He had an ego. Or no, maybe it wasn&#39;t an ego...he was quite the short fuse. It wasn&#39;t something that could easily be set off by insults, but it seemed more to do with constant failure. Christopher was able to react quite easily to Archer when they were exposed, so they had to resign themselves to staying hidden, out of sight. It must have been burning them up inside, being dealt such a shit hand, but Christopher had to admit that it at least put them in a good spot. 

&quot;Damn...this is actually a little tricky.&quot; 

There was only one thing to really do in a situation like this. To make best laid plans. 

The sand did nicely to cover the wolf as he brought his staff down, with the dust kicked up unfurling around him as a smog. The cloud rolled silently, lazily, fading slowly...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097689869830078464 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097689869830078464><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 17, 2023 8:07 PM">8:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em> 
From the top, a hole billowed out and unfolded for the wreathing cape of Lancer to flow against the night sky above, staff stretched around the form as they both hurled into the sky.

Yet, it wasn’t quite the sight he had wished for. 

Lachlan’s dominant arm instinctively reached out, attempting to block the surgical tool from carrying out its intended function. As a sharp pain was felt in that very wrist. 

Soon the pair were once again on the ground. Face to face. 

An intimate moment of violence. Pain. Brutality. Survival in its purest form. 

“It’s the age old adage. <strong>Form follows Function</strong>.” Marcus’s face grimaces slightly with pain as the dagger was twisted in his wrist. “Even the dumbest of orthopedic surgeons know that, perhaps you aren’t that bright. You fell for the trick once. You stupidly got this close.” 

His other hand gripped the lighter tightly. Before turning it and becoming the trusted blade which has served the Adlers for a few generations now. “You’re right though, I doubt others will be dull enough to fall for that.” 

With a forceful shove, the knife aimed upwards. “The hammer was to get you this close.” The knife’s blade found itself into Lachlan’s abdomen. A few centimeters away from his abdominal aorta. “I’ve never operated on someone awake.” The necromancer’s eyes were dead. There wasn’t thrill. There wasn’t the look of survival. It was cold darkness. That expression of pain was no longer plastered on his face as Marcus continued to press his knife further upwards. 

“My life is already forfeit. Cancer is making sure of that. What can you do to even scare me? Make me fear for <em>life again</em>.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097805620524105769 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097805620524105769><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 3:47 AM">3:47 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

That sort of dingy area was the perfect hiding spot for Cherokee Bill, who had lived on the run for years. Even Christopher&#39;s lupine eyes could not catch glimpses of the cowboy, shuffling from gravestone to gravestone in the corner of his eye.

So, Lancer simply didn&#39;t bother with that. Instead, he slammed at the sand with overwhelming force.

&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Bill almost sneezed from the cloud of dust that had gathered from the tip of Lancer&#39;s stuff. He took cover on a cactus, leaning left as he stared at the sky. Something was flying: A cloak flapping in the wind with Lancer&#39;s staff attached to it.

<em>&quot;Trying to spy at me from above? What a joke.&quot;</em> Bill chuckled, taking aim and immediately firing. There was no gun flash, nor any sound. After all, his first shot was always unseen, unpredictable, unknowable. That&#39;s how an outlaw fought.

Only the first one, though.

<em>riiip</em>

The cape ripped through, revealing neither flesh nor fur. The cloth fell off, revealing only the staff and no sign of its owner. A cheap trick to draw Bill out.

<em>&quot;Ha.&quot;</em> Bill laughed inside. <em>&quot;You deadass thought I was going to fall for that? Sorry to break it to you, Fido, but I&#39;m far lazier than you can even imagine. I can take my sweet time with you instead of firing away blindly. Now, where are you-&quot;</em>

Archer looked around, trying to find any traces of his opponent, only to catch a glimpse of Lachlan and Marcus fighting instead. It looked reassuring at first, with an injured Lachlan clearly overwhelming the far older man that was Lancer&#39;s Master. Bill was no expert at hand-to-hand, but he had been in fistfights before: The one with youth and grit would often win.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097969210463883365 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097969210463883365><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 2:37 PM">2:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Until the saw the knife stab Lachlan in the abdomen, putting doubt in his theory. The Archer snarled in a mixture of anger and disappointment.

<em>&lt;I told you I&#39;m not a fucking babysitter!&gt;</em> The Servant shouted, making a mad dash for his Master from tombstone to tombstone. If he was quick enough, he&#39;d be able to avoid Lancer&#39;s prying eyes-

-were it not for the horde of zombies that still persisted thanks to Marcus&#39; efforts. Dancer was still buried underneath them, endlessly cleaving at them and generating more corpses in that depraved tower of flesh and bone. The ghouls took notice of Bill, starting to block his path with their shuffling and massive numbers. The entire graveyard had been turned against him.

Bill&#39;s veins pulsated, his fists clenched in rage. He stared at the horde in disbelief, wondering about how stupid the zombies must have been to dare block his path. It was a waste of time on his side and a waste of life on their side. The view to Lachlan was completely blocked by that wall of maggot infested flesh and bone protruding from the skin.

Bill grit his teeth, grinding them like stones as he raised his guns and counted the bullets. He left the shadows, exposing himself to the air as the zombies approached him with unprecedented ferocity, viewing him as a bigger threat. It was impossible to sneak past them all, not when the horde was so big. The only solution was to cleave through them and get to Lachlan.

&quot;Anybody wanna leave? Now&#39;s the time.&quot; Bill shouted, filled with murderous intent as he took aim with both of his guns. The horde marched forward.

&quot;Oh y&#39;all staying? Good. <strong>You get to die twice.</strong>&quot;

<em><strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097969298762379355 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097969298762379355><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 2:38 PM">2:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He fired bullet after bullet, watching them shred through old flesh like tissue paper. Heads exploded like watermelons as dried blood and guts littered the scene. The zombies tried their best to slow him down, coalescing into a giant mound that threatened to hide Lachlan away forever. Bill had no choice but to keep shooting, the gunshots getting louder and the muzzle fire finally attracting Christopher&#39;s attention. His opponent was now exposed, and by the looks of it, completely distracted.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

No point in reloading when his enemies were so pathetic. Bill tapped his triggers repeatedly, firing so fast that his guns seemed automatic. Torsos were chopped in half, zombies dragging themselves by the upper body before losing total control of their limbs. Archer kept up this slow march for a while, trying his best to maintain his composure: It was becoming increasingly hard to not grow bored of shooting at the horde in front of him.

He eventually noticed that something else was cutting up the corpses alongside him, which coincidentally seemed to be nearing Lachlan&#39;s location. Bill hurried up, shooting his front and back repeatedly before coming across a gigantic pile of slaughtered flesh. He shot at it instinctively, feeling something clawing at it from underneath. A mangled corpse emerged, until Archer took a closer glance and realized that it was still pulsing with life.

Dancer reemerged, injured and worse for wear, but still in the fight.

&quot;Who the hell made you?!&quot; Bill asked in a combination of annoyance and curiosity. &quot;Whatever, I don&#39;t give a fuck. Take care of this shit for me!&quot; He ordered, despite not being its Master. He ran past Dancer and made a beeline for Lachlan, who was still locked in combat with Marcus.

&quot;I had to gamble if that would even work...and I lost. I am grateful though that you decided to intervene in this Master&#39;s duel. Scared mine has a bit more resolve? But we&#39;re not done. And I promised you...

<em>“My life is already forfeit. Cancer is making sure of that. What can you do to even scare me? Make me fear for life again.&quot;</em>

Marcus&#39;s words caught him, moments before lunging once more after Archer, his attention on the two Masters locked in a mesh of blood, sweat and rage. Cancer...he was dying? 

&quot;...I&#39;m going to give you a chance.&quot; Christopher slowly leveled his staff at Bill before casting a glance at their Masters. &quot;I think we both know we&#39;ll both be out of luck if they kill each other. If you&#39;re an Archer, you can likely survive for a bit without your Master. <strong>I can too.</strong> So, rather than both of us being forced on the search for a new bid in this war, why don&#39;t we get them out of here, live to fight again.

Lachlan gasped, feeling the dagger worm its way under his skin, slicing through the tender layers of muscles and fat protecting his precious organs. Though he had operated on countless Skinwalkers, the composition of his own body was no more than that of an ordinary human. One wrong move, and many things could spell the end for him.

The blade currently lodged in his abdomen made him acutely aware of this fact: a crude warning from the Coroner. His body reacted as well, muscles convulsing around the wound, cold sweat drenching his clothes. He was losing blood, fast. The smart move would be to back down, live, so he could fight another day. But if he chose that option—

Then history would repeat itself, wouldn&#39;t it? And look where that had gotten him once.

With a grunt, Lachlan drove his own blade into the ground, pinning Marcus&#39; wrist in place like a butterfly on an insect board. Instead of pulling away, he stayed where he was, using his weight and all the strength he could muster to prevent Marcus from breaking free. 

&#39;Sounds like you&#39;ve lived more than <em>enough</em>, doctor. So, what&#39;s one more sacrifice for <em><strong>my</strong></em> sake?&#39; 

Lachlan snarled at the Coroner, his good hand wrapping itself around the hilt of the dagger as well, preventing Marcus from yanking it out. A weapon that was kept in place - even if it was embedded in his own body - was safer than allowing it to freely swing around.

&#39;Unfortunately for you, I still have much to live for. Dying here would completely derail my plans,&#39; his chest heaved with exertion. &#39;Those with little attachment to this world should step aside!&#39;

<em>SMASH!</em>

The ground shook as one elongated limb punctured the soil on Marcus&#39; left, followed by another limb on his right. A looming shadow eclipsed the moon: Leapfrog had dragged its body off the ground, a leaky, gaping hole in the center of its torso as it towered over them both. 

Its intent was unmistakable. With Lachlan acting as the weight holding Marcus down, Leapfrog was now free to unleash its attack. Its featureless face fixated on its target. Slowly, it raised not one or two, but <em>four</em> of its limbs off the ground, poised in the air like a mutated boxer ready to strike. And the strike zone?

The Coroner&#39;s head.

&#39;Resolve alone doesn&#39;t win this War,&#39; the puppeteer said with an agonized wheeze. &#39;It&#39;s all about resourcefulness. And you&#39;ve just about used up all of yours.&#39;

It would have been comforting if not for the fact that his disposition remained dead and cold. His inner decay showing outwardly. 

Arm now pinned away from Lachlan, the other still firmly held onto his trusted knife. Deep in the abdomen of the boy. Only to be held there now by reinforcement mage craft. Halting any possibility of the coroner from finishing his opening cut into the abdomen of the puppeteer. 

“Perhaps you should rethink your approach.” The icy tone of the necromancer only intensified as his dead eyes stared deeply into Lachlan’s own. “I don’t intend to be a petty sacrifice. Or step out of your pitiful way. I intend to <em>win</em>, to claim a wish. Achieve something which can save thousands.” 

“If you have to die. So be it. Every wish has its <em>cost</em>.” Then a smash was heard. The leapfrog having finally freed itself from the blossoming rib cage settled within is body. 

The beast then reared up. 

Instinctively Marcus cast his Rigor Mortis across his entire body. From head to toe, the coroner became as stiff as those corpses he operates on. 

And it’s strikes rained down, battering and bruising where ever it could strike, mainly focused upon the head and face of the man. 

That stiffness which encapsulated the necromancers whole being allowed him to survive the pummeling with some consequence, including a few teeth loosened in his mouth and potentially a concussion. Things he could deal with in due time. It was painful in that moment, yet the pain didn’t drag out any emotion from the man. 

When there was finally a point to breath. Marcus simply spat a tooth up towards Lachlan. “Jaw. Tear.” 

Soon it grew into the lower portion of a human jaw. Digging into the face of the puppeteer. Tearing him open like an excited child on Christmas Day. 

“Resourcefulness is something we Adlers excel at. I have plenty of tricks to still play with.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098358196877406278 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098358196877406278><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 4:23 PM">4:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill felt like his skull had split in two, his hat almost falling off his head as he flew into the pile of zombies like a human bullet. Grabby hands started lunging for every crevice in his flesh like a needy whore. The stench was atrocious and the incoherent babbling of decayed jaws echoed in his head. But worst of all was when he received Lachlan&#39;s message, where he politely received the order to shut up.

<em><strong>&quot;BITCH!&quot;</strong></em> The cowboy threw a fit, poking his guns into any holes he could find. Eyes, mouths, ears, entrails, buttholes, anything that fit.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Brain matter, blood and fleshy pink bits started to rain down from the sky. Bill&#39;s bullets pierced through bodies like tissue paper, starting from the anus and travelling all the way to the skull. He mowed down the horde like no tomorrow, the graveyard looking like a bloody rose that had just bloomed. It was a battlefield littered with corpses and gore, enough to get the Dancer riled up as it took over a portion of the horde, finally allowing Bill some leeway as he got out covered in old blood.

He coughed, emerging from the pile as his bloodied coat shrouded him like a cloak. He glared at Christopher with eyes ready to kill at any moment. He let the wolf run their mouth, give off a silly speech while the cowboy cracked his neck.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna wear your face around my neck. Should pair well with the hat.&quot; Bill said, bluntly. &quot;God willing, you won&#39;t leave this fucking island. Actually, you know what?&quot; Bill raised his gun and had it cross paths with Christopher&#39;s staff. A threat was being made.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go now. I&#39;m going to pick my Master up, and when I do, I&#39;m going to fill your Master full of lead. Then I&#39;ll beat the soul out of you once I&#39;m done.

<em>BANG!</em>

He shot at Lancer&#39;s staff, tilting it upward and raising it in the same vein as a gate at the crossroads. Bill then sprinted past, making a mad dash for Lachlan who was still struggling against Marcus&#39; onslaught. Christopher would be tempted to follow suit, only to find out that the horde was now blocking him instead, along with Dancer who was chopping down any remaining zombies. How annoying.

<em>&lt;Haven&#39;t you killed the bastard yet?! You goddamn brat-&gt;</em> Bill raged in his head, noticing Lachlan&#39;s condition from afar.

But in between the bouts of pain, Leapfrog&#39;s incessant pummeling, and the Coroner&#39;s tough talk, Lachlan found himself laughing and couldn&#39;t stop because there was just something <em>so stupidly funny</em> about this whole damn situation, the three of them rolling around on the grass, each trying to stake the other like a horror film gone awry.

&#39;Oh, shut your mouth,&#39; he snapped, ripping the dagger out of him and flinging it into the grass. &#39;You adults always cloak your intentions in lofty goals. You don&#39;t even care about your own life or the one right in front of you, yet you think you have the privilege to save thousands? Walk before you learn to run, doctor!&#39;

The puppeteer spat pure venom. He plunged several fingers into his wound, feeling out the damage despite the copious amounts of blood seeping through his shirt. <em>Bad move,</em> a part of his brain warned. <em>Shouldn&#39;t have gotten rid of the dagger.</em> But the rest of him ignored it as the pain suddenly dulled, and he wondered if he was going insane.

A memory flashed through his mind — some animals released chemicals that inhibited their pain receptors in the face of death. Was he experiencing a similar effect? Was his body producing euphoric chemicals to alleviate the stress he was under?

It didn&#39;t matter, he told himself. None of it mattered, so long as the Coroner stopped writhing before he did. It made perfect sense, didn&#39;t it, that victory was always won through the other&#39;s defeat? A sick pleasure bubbled up within him as he watched Marcus&#39; face deform right before his eyes.

&#39;Cat got your tongue, doc?&#39; He teased with malicious intent. &#39;Shouldn&#39;t have listened to your Servant—&#39;

Marcus&#39; jaw moved, and stars burst across his vision. He faltered, feeling a searing heat against the side of his head as something clamped down hard on his cheekbone. 

And tore his face apart.

Scars and burns traced uneven patterns across twisted flesh. His eyes bulged in horror as he realized the extent of damage Marcus had caused. Exposed him, as if he were stripped naked in front of a jury, every single imperfection...

It then dug deep. Incisors and Canines cutting and tearing into the supple flesh. Before finally tearing away the face. Expecting to see the fine musculature of the many muscles of facial movement. Things he didn’t get to see often in his old line or new line of work. 

What was surprising was the fact that The Face of Lachlan J. Dowling was not his own face. Not only that, but the true face was not a thing of pristine beauty. Instead it was a thing of horror. A creature to be hidden deep within one of the various graves that surrounded them currently. 

In that moment of horror which the puppeteer experienced, the stiffened form of the necromancer moved. Jerking both the free arm, and both legs to flip the dowling right into his puppet. Hopeful to give him some space, and cease the pummeling. 

Before rolling onto his stomach and stiffly producing a finger bone from his bag at his side. Flicking it right at Lachlan. “Never remove the blade first. Rookie mistake.”

Unlike the careful hands of the ex-surgeon, this being only had one mission. A sole purpose for being reformed in such a manner. 

To Kill. Maim. <strong>Eviscerate</strong>. 

As such it made purchase right into the abdominal cavity of Lachlan. Gripping bowel and viscera within its sharp grip and attempting to pry it free from  within the puppeteer’s form. Then letting it slide from out of the incision made. It was not a well practiced motion of moving organs out of the way. It was shoddy. Meant to inflict as much harm as possible, and disturb the internal anatomy in a violent and shocking manner. 

Marcus could only watch it’s brutality for a moment before the leapfrog approached once again. Forcing the coroner to wrap himself into the fetal position. 

Consciousness was close to being lost. The necromancer strained himself to the very edge, and most likely over it. All he could do was hope to not bleed out before Lachlan gave in, or either servant deemed it necessary to intervene.

The threat was severe, though it left the Saint wondering if Archer truly understood to whom he was directing it to. This fight between Masters was the more ferocious it seemed, but the glare in Archer&#39;s eyes let Christopher know that it could get far more violent. The promise of ending Marcus was one that he wouldn&#39;t abide. Something he <em>couldn&#39;t</em> abide, because he knew now there was more to his Master than a simple wish. He was pushing his very limits all for the sake of such a wish...

And a horde of his own undead, combined with the intruders own abominations would be Marcus&#39;s undoing if he didn&#39;t hurry. 

Truly, his Master was strong. This was passed with flying colors. 

&quot;Archer...I&#39;m a Christian, first and foremost...&quot; 

Lancer waltzed forward, the horde noticing his stride and slowly making their way to gnaw on the furred pelt, all while the Dancer continued to slice at their decaying flesh and bone. His hand gripped the Staff tight.

&quot;So know I don&#39;t say this lightly...know I&#39;m going to have to beg forgiveness...&quot; 

The undead began to chew on his forearms and legs, themselves shambling along with Lancer as he approached the Dancer, his Staff raising high. 

&quot;But you...you are pushing what it means for me to be a Christian, so I think He&#39;ll understand...but you skin me? No...before I ferried people across rivers, I would tear them limb from limb. I would pulverize their bones into jelly and drain their bodies of blood.&quot; 

A swift swipe of his staff sent the few Zombies in his reach flying into the Mirage of Bill&#39;s power, whether they were skewered on cacti or blown to bits from contact against the tombstones that still littered the sands. 

The Dancer finally noticed, but all too late as Christopher slammed his Staff into its body, the sickening thud of rotted bone crackling from the inside and snapping, with edges poking against mottled skin. But he wasn&#39;t done.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;I was a bad man, Archer. And if you even fire a blank at my Master, then I&#39;ll show you that bad man, and I&#39;ll start by peeling your Master like a fruit, and throw the skin to you as a pity prize.&quot; 

And Lancer felt a demonstration was in order, as he stabbed the Dancer through the middle before he gripped one of its limbs tightly by the joint. <strong>SHRIPP</strong>

Raindrops. Deep, brownish raindrops fell on the undead as Lancer threw the limb to the remaining horde to feed, before digging his hands into the open wound, pulling tight and lifting skin from fused sinew and yellowed bone, tearing a sheet from its back before tossing it aside like a towel. He gripped the Staff once more, before catching a glimpse of the other creature gunning to kill Marcus. 

Lancer dashed to meet it, Staff at the ready as he stole a glance to Bill. He knew Archer would not yield, so the only thing to do was stand by Marcus&#39;s side. He had done considerable damage, and more importantly, shown the lengths he was willing to go for this wish. Now it was time to return the favor, as he leveled the tip of his Staff at Leapfrog before it stretched forward to puncture the creature in its assault.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098824340625182740 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098824340625182740><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 11:15 PM">11:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan was silent, either willingly or because he simply wasn&#39;t in a state to reply. Neither option felt promising, causing the cowboy to curse himself as he inched closer to his target. The sound of Dancer being butchered didn&#39;t escape his ears and he could hear Christopher approaching like a hungry coyote.

&quot;Wait your turn.&quot; Bill warned, but Lancer paid him no mind, already rushing in with his superior speed. Archer looked forward and witnessed a gruesome sight: His Master&#39;s face being eaten by some unhinged jaw, the damage being so severe that Lachlan was forced to cover himself as Leapfrog intervened. The gigantic puppet seemed to put the pressure on Marcus for a bit, until Lancer joined in to attack.

<em>BANG!</em>

Bill instinctively fired at the staff, &#39;parrying&#39; the blow and slowing down the speed of the hit. But that wasn&#39;t all: The staff ricocheted at the perfect angle to be sent flying towards Marcus. However, due to its proximity to Christopher, the wolf was able to clearly see the bullet&#39;s trajectory and predict where it would hit. His Master was in danger.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

And to make it even more obvious, Bill fired several more, all aimed towards Marcus. He was taking Christopher&#39;s promise at heart to protect their Master, while Bill leaned closer to his own.

<em>&lt;What are you doing?! Get the fuck outta here already!&gt;</em> Bill screamed again, now just a few steps away from reaching Lachlan. He stared at Leapfrog, which was somehow still intact in all of the previous struggles. &quot;Help your master your dumb piece of shit!&quot; He gave it a light kick. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A heaviness set into his stomach, the weight of an intruder that had dug its way into his gut and was now wrenching his organs loose from their inner linings. Like plucking cotton balls from a plush toy, his body was being hollowed from the inside out.

<em>&#39;No. I don&#39;t want to die. I don&#39;t want to face those things again...&#39;</em>
<em>&#39;Please, please, please, let me go. Please let me go, please!&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;It hurts! It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts hurts hurts hurts hurts hurts hurts—&#39;</em>
<em>&#39;You fucking <strong>monster</strong>.&#39;</em>

Dozens of voices cried out, each one belonging to his puppets, each one screaming over one other, vying for his attention. Lachlan struggled to push them back as usual, but in his weakened state, it felt like a monumental task. The voices blended together in a deafening symphony filled with torment and despair, gnawing his mind, drowning him in their madness.

But then there was a new voice, this one wry and crackling and rising above the others, cutting through the incessant clamors with its urgency, <em><strong>&lt;What are you doing? Get the fuck outta here!&gt;</strong></em> And the puppeteer thought, <em>who is that, how dare you boss me around, who is that voice I know who is...</em>

He screamed.

He screamed in his mind, screamed with all his strength, clutched the words that almost sounded <em>caring</em> amidst the chaos that threatened to tear his mind apart. He hung onto Bill&#39;s voice like a drowning man clinging to a straw.

And screamed back. <em><strong>&lt;KILL HIM&gt;</strong></em>

He doubled down on his order. <em>&lt;HE SAW, HE SAW, <strong>HE SAW</strong>&gt;</em>

<em>And</em> no one <em>gets away with that.</em>

He gripped his metaphorical lifeline, and collapsed onto the ground.

<em>&lt;DON&#39;T LET HIM GET AWAY—&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A sharp, pale claw split the air apart, its sharp tips headed straight for the hand burrowing inside Lachlan&#39;s abdomen.

The Dancer had returned. Crawled back on its remaining limbs, and made quick work of the intruding limb with its claws. One swing and the palm of Marcus&#39; creation was sliced clean off, leaving only the fingers still wriggling inside. Then, wheeling around, it plunged its gaping maw into the bloody wound and tore the fingers out of its master&#39;s stomach, along with several chunks of flesh.

Clumsy. 

Though it had managed to get the job done, the Dancer had left a messy aftermath and possibly caused more harm to Lachlan in the process. However, its intent could not be faulted, as it had been programmed to fulfill one duty and one duty alone — that of protecting its master against all potential threats. 

And to that end, the Dancer had succeeded.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">&#39;Grrrrr...&#39;</code>

Its skinless back prickled as memories of Lancer&#39;s abuse resurfaced, joining in on the confusion in its disquieted mind. But through muscle memory alone, it maintained a defensive stance. The puppet proceeded to cradle Lachlan with its three limbs, as a lion would to protect its cub, and positively bristled at the wolfish entity that dared approach its master.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, April 22, 2023 5:04 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Leapfrog wriggled and squirmed like an oversized bug as Bill’s foot collided with its body. The impact aggravated its wound, and it let out anguished gurgles that sounded like the cries of a helpless animal…

…Or a tortured human in distress. The sounds that emerged from its mouth were guttural and animalistic, but there were occasional bursts of sound that almost resembled words. They didn’t sound much like English, but Bill’s mind, blessed with knowledge by the Grail, pieced the syllables together all the same.

Leapfrog was in agony.

But despite its pain, the puppet still obeyed it’s master’s commands. As Lancer’s staff was deflected by a bullet, the creature crawled out from his custody and began to make its way towards Marcus once again.

A deeper will than his own carelessness with his life had seemingly taken over. Using what strands of mana it could to upkeep that stiff death-like state that. 

Bullets flew past. Remarks were made. Servants still were interlocked in a heated battle. Neither ceasing on their assault. Yet amongst the chaos something struck the coroner’s mind. 

Lancer. No, Christopher had decided to remain by the necromancer’s side. He had proven himself, at the very least in this fight. Other encounters in the future could be a different tale. 

Weakly the man spoke through their mental link. “Yet you stayed anyways. Perhaps I should just get you a collar and leash, maybe throw some ‘good boys’ in there too.” A stiff chuckle was barely audible as the man joked with the Saint in this dire situation. 

“So, if we both end up in hell after this… drinks on me? If we even do.” Marcus spoke once more through that link held between master and servant. Weakly his body moved, yet the blood loss and fatigue of an extended battle were showing. 

“<strong>Show them the true strength of a saint</strong>.” His voice however was audible. A glow coming from the back of the Coroner’s Neck. 

A command spell was activated. It’s intention to drive away both Archer and Lachlan. While Marcus’s own corpse-like form remained behind that of Lancer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100052995619696750 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100052995619696750><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 24, 2023 8:37 AM">8:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill&#39;s shots were swift, and while he was at the end of his rope, he wasn&#39;t firing blindly. If anything, he was far more calculated, and far more methodical about where his bullets were heading. 3 more followed behind, Christopher&#39;s perception able to pinpoint exactly where they were headed. Each shot was fatal. Combined with the mass of flesh that that was crawling for his Master, and Christopher realized just what the Archer wanted. Not a stalemate. No, he&#39;d never agree to lay their arms down...he wanted to see Lancer bleed. 

&quot;You bastard...&quot; He growled before he ran forward, keeping the bullets close as he tried to make a quick dash. He wondered if Marcus was even aware of what was happening...that was a lot of blood, but how much of that was his? He passed Leapfrog, sucking at his teeth as he shut his eyes tight, reaching out for his Staff as it kept flying towards Marcus&#39; head. His hand gripped the hilt before quickly recalling its length, managing to prevent the club end from crushing Marcus&#39;s skull by mere centimeters. 

&quot;I was admiring your tenacity, Marcus, but I&#39;m starting to think it&#39;s going to be more trouble than it&#39;s worth...&quot; 

<em>SHNK</em> 

His eyes shut tight as a growl ripped from his throat; one of Bill&#39;s bullets found itself lodged squarely in his side, blood seeping into the cloak that rolled along his back, obscuring his form and giving him enough time for a short twist of his hand as he swung at the remaining bullets. One deflected itself, right back at Lachlan. The other...

Found itself in Lancer&#39;s chest, the Saint taking a knee as his frame blocked Marcus from view, leaving him panting. Micromovements prevented it from puncturing his heart, but good lord, did it hurt. In fact, all of him hurt. He didn&#39;t want to admit it, but the fight had definitely taken a toll. The few shots Archer had managed to land were decent ones.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He would need a miracle if he was going to push forward...

<strong>Show them the true strength of a saint.</strong>

And if you ask, it shall appear. Power overflowed his senses, Lancer himself trembling as his bleeding stopped and his muscles bristled against his armor. The sounds of ripping fibers allowed his muscles to bleed through in patches, revealing that the carpet did not, indeed, matche the drapes. It was smooth, bristling musculature, and the power coursing through Christopher caused his eyes to glow. It was so much stimulus all at once, that the Lancer couldn&#39;t help but throw back his head and howl, long and loud. His voice carried across the graveyard, shaking a few of Marcus&#39; corpses from their aimless shambles to turn back at the creature, his eyes now bright white and his maw and tongue red with intent to kill. 

Christopher threw his cane at Leapfrog, the tip puncturing the mottled flesh and digging the staff deep into the earth, skewering the creature. With a tug, a patch of earth came along with Leapfrog, with Christopher holding it aloft like a trophy before quickly flinging it towards Bill. His true prize was Lachlan, his eyes Lazer focused and his teeth gnashing as he ran, on all fours, for the Master.

He was fuming, still thinking about how he had the perfect setup to get rid of Lancer, only to be forced to come to his Master&#39;s rescue. That brat was lucky to have him around!

He was about to send more telepathic messages. Strongly worded letters designed to convey exactly how useless Lachlan was being.

He received a roar instead, one echoing loud enough to drown the voices of thousands. A murderous shrill filled with killing intent, begging him to finish off a single target: Lancer&#39;s Master. They needed to die. No matter what, they couldn&#39;t live. Even if it cost Lachlan his own life.

Of course, Bill didn&#39;t care about his Master&#39;s wants. How could he focus on that when Marcus was now surging with mana? The old man&#39;s hand flashed a deep crimson as Lancer soon matched that shade, their aura overwhelming the graveyard and causing ripples of red static to course through the ground.

As a Servant, it wasn&#39;t difficult for Cherokee Bill to realize what had happened. Lachlan had taunted him plenty with those before. A Command Spell had been used and Lancer was now looking a lot better despite his bullet injuries. He breezed past Leapfrog and overpowered it, before turning it into a projectile headed straight for Bill.

&quot;Goddamnit.&quot; Bill spewed, furious as he crouched down before the fleshy abomination could hit him. As the puppet rolled past, his eyes adjusted back to Marcus, who was still dying. Command Spell or not, a Master was still a human. His gun was loaded and ready to fire. One shot would end it-

-But Christopher had already made the first move, using Leapfrog as a distraction in order to make a beeline for Lachlan. The little prick couldn&#39;t even move, still clutching at his face and writhing in pain. All it would take was one hit of Lancer&#39;s staff to crush Lachlan&#39;s head into a fine paste. They were just steps apart.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100178348644241509 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100178348644241509><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 24, 2023 4:55 PM">4:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

<em>&lt;YOU get away!&gt;</em> Bill snarled, the sound of his shoulder bones cracking as he put himself between Lachlan and Christopher. The wolf&#39;s strength was far superior, the cowboy feeling like he was a rock trying to stop a bullet train. Bones were cracking and blood was seeping through his clothes, but he held his head strong. 

<em>&lt;Get away, before I kill you myself!&gt;</em> He gave Lachlan a nasty glare before turning around to face Christopher.

&quot;Hah...Don&#39;t think I care much for your new name, Fido.&quot; Bill chuckled, hiding his pain as blood dripped from his lips. &quot;Not like it matters, since you&#39;ll die like a dog anyway.&quot;

&quot;Ya hear that?&quot; Bill asked, a shit eating grin covered by his mask. If Christopher were to look down, he would notice that Archer&#39;s gun was pointed forward, albeit not to the wolf&#39;s body, but to what was behind him. If he turned around, he would notice that it was at the perfect angle to take a shot at Marcus.

&quot;I&#39;ve had a gun pointed at that fossil of your Master before we even crashed. How far would ya say we&#39;re from him? Thirty meters? Fifty? Sixty? Well, whatever the range, I can say that at this distance, I&#39;m a real sharp-eye.&quot; Bill laughed, his body shaking, yet his hand remaining steady and firm. His shot would not miss.

&quot;Now, you could lean down over here and give me a nice little smooch,&quot; Bill stroked at Christopher&#39;s neck. &quot;Or ya could go back to your cooch, like a good little doggy-&quot;

<em>BANG!</em>

He fired, distracting Lancer with small talk as a bullet was now just half a second from hitting Marcus.

&quot;Time&#39;s up, Fido.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Spiked when he felt a great tremor around him, the body of the Dancer shuddering and twisting as it moved on autopilot, relying on nothing but muscle memory as it soaked up the stray bullet that had been intended for its master. The bullet pierced its back and left its throat in a blazing hot trail, nearly severing its body in halves. 

<em>&#39;PLEASE NO MORE MAKE IT STOP&#39;</em>

<em>&#39;SHUT UP,&#39;</em> snapped Lachlan. <em>&#39;KNOW YOUR PLACE!&#39;</em>

Head swimming with voices and flashes of vision, Lachlan crawled out of the Dancer&#39;s embrace. The puppet was little more than a useless sack of flesh now, as it had been abused beyond recognition: even though it could still move, its body had been turned to swiss cheese, and could provide little in the way of cover.

Lachlan lowered himself onto the damp grass. It felt warm against his skin. Bill continued to scream into his mind without a care, threatening to split his head with his sheer volume. Lachlan gritted his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to limit his sensory input to a minimum. 

<em>The insolent prick, didn&#39;t he tell him not to boss him around?</em>

He took a shuddering breath, trying to focus on the sensations of his own body instead: hair tickling his face, molars grinding against one another, fingers digging into slick, soft skin.

<em>I am here, I am me, my thoughts are my own...</em>

Another gunshot. This time so close to him he could taste the sulfur in the air.

<em>Did he do it, did he take the shot, is the doc dead...</em>

Then he heard Bill&#39;s voice again — but this time it came through his ears rather than his mind. The words all sounded jumbled to him, but the fact that he had the luxury to talk could only mean one thing.

<em>He&#39;s done the deed...</em>

He kept his good hand firmly planted on his face, allowing the gash in his stomach to bleed freely.

If his Master was on the backfoot, how could he abandon him? Especially with such a display of bravado against odds that were clearly far beyond him? If anything, the powered Lancer could leave Bill with one parting gift...

He hated to buy into the taunts, but he couldn&#39;t allow Archer to leave this confrontation with his pride intact. He needed to deliver some kind of mark, a reminder of just who he would be dealing with should they ever cross paths again. 

So he leaned forward for the smooch that Bill so desperately wanted, waiting just for the moment when he would fire the bullet. The moment the bitter scent of gunpowder reached his nostrils, Lancer opened his mouth wide and bit deep into Archer&#39;s shoulder. His fangs dug in, just enough that when the Saint tore away, a trail of blood and strips of flesh flew along with him as he followed behind the bullet. 

He kept it in his line of sight, able to track just where it would lodge itself. It seemed Archer truly was a good shot, as this was going right for Marcus&#39;s head. Hopefully that bite would be enough to dissuade him from taking Lancer for a fool ever again. On the very edge of losing the bullet, Lancer had to make a move. His Staff held aloft, he pointed it towards the very angle of the bullet&#39;s trajectory, managing to knock it by a hair as it passed by Marcus&#39;s ear, leaving Lancer the opportunity to shroud the Coroner in his cape and wrap him tightly in his arms. His body was still shivering with power, and arms twitched as he held his Master tight. He desperately wanted to use it, but it seems Archer&#39;s abilities would always pose a threat to anything around him.

Bill&#39;s usual wisecracking went silent for a brief, fleeting moment. A huge chunk of his shoulder came off, bones and all. Strips of flesh littered the battlefield as the cowboy&#39;s screams of pain sounded more like incoherent gargling, as if he was far too furious to scream.

<em>&quot;Cocksucker.&quot;</em> He whimpered, raising his gun as he attempted to fire another shot. He trembled as he heard Lachlan invade his mind once again, now giving him actual orders after that outburst from earlier.

<em>&lt;You&#39;re useless.&gt;</em> Bill scoffed, holstering his pistol and placing an arm on his bloodied shoulder. It was dripping red and blending in with his coat, much to his displeasure. He couldn&#39;t remember the last time he had been hurt like that, which further drove down the stake in his pride.

<em>&lt;If I could choose, I&#39;d have you crawl all the way back home.&gt;</em> The cowboy spat back, shuffling to his Master with discontent in his voice. <em>&lt;But you&#39;re a lucky punk, because I have a need for scum like you. Now, grit your teeth.&gt;</em>

He dragged Lachlan by the scruff of his neck, much like a cat at a vet. It was painful, and shameful. Old wounds started to reopen from the rough treatment, especially when Bill placed him on his bloodied shoulder in a fireman carry. It was disgusting. 

Then, either out of courtesy or just a case of being thrifty, Bill grabbed Dancer&#39;s leg with his free arm, dragging it towards him as he started to speed off into the night. Both puppet and Lachlan were being carried away while Christopher tended to his own Master&#39;s injuries. It was at this point that they all realized the fight was over.  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="hawaii117">@Soup Island</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

A cacophony of bullets, growls, and other noises didn’t even rouse the man. 

Was he truly dead? 

When Christopher lofted the body into his grasp, there was a slight sputtering as the necromancer showed he was alive. 

“Good job, Saint.” He mused within their mental connection. Limply hanging from lancer’s grasp, as if he were a raggedy Anne doll. It was certain that he’d need some time to recuperate.  And most definitely he needs a smoke.</span></div></div></div></div></div>
