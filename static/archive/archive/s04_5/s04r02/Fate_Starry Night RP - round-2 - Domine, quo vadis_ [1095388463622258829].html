With the wave of rumors spreading amongst the people of Berenice about the strange happenings recently occurring in and around the island came two more strange accounts:

The first being word that a doctor from the United States bought a derelict hotel infamous for being the site of a murder some years ago for the purpose of running an emergency clinic out of it in the wake of the recent blackout and the sudden surge in disappearances that has led to places such as homes and businesses - medical centers included - becoming abandoned (or short-staffed)… though many are reluctant to reach out to the doctor even in times of need, having heard that the area surrounding the hotel has become a hotspot for these said disappearances, with some even pointing to the foreigner as being the culprit behind them.

The second being the sudden rise in sightings of a “malicious ghost” whose very presence brings about a chill to the spine and a spike in one’s level of anxiety. Some claim to have even seen this ghost viciously tear apart one or multiple victims with a variety of weapons and tools, only to be unable to recall much of anything about the scene - the identity of its victim(s) and any discernible features of the ghost included - though these same people always seem to remember the presence of an awful, acrid and metallic smell, and/or the presence of a “silent watcher” that they were too occupied by the sight of the vile spirit to focus on.

Despite the worrying nature of these stories, there are just as many if not more locals who refuse to believe such things, going about their daily lives without so much as a thought of concern. In truth, however, this malicious ghost and the one behind a number of these disappearances are not just so, so very real, but are - in fact - one and the same…</span></div></div></div></div></div>

On that note, I bid you a good morning.”</em>

If the young mage this message was meant for were to respond to it by speaking, one would almost assuredly figure he had a loose screw or two. Then again, being woken up early in the morning by a voice inside one’s head isn’t exactly the least aggravating thing in the world - especially if that voice had nothing but business in mind - and would most certainly draw a violent physical reaction from a number of people. People much unlike Wilt.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 11:13 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1095743118223097967 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1095743118223097967><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 12, 2023 11:11 AM">11:11 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>”I’ve prepared a change of outfit for you, as well as a light morning meal and a mug of hot coffee.

Despite the immaterial nature of the man talking to Wilt, it would become apparent rather quickly that what he said was true. At the foot of the mage’s bed he would find a small pile of neatly folded and ironed clothes consisting of not only a single outfit, but a selection of them. Just as well, he would find sitting upon the bed table nearest to him a bowl of an oatmeal-like substance with a spoon atop a napkin and a tall glass of milk nearby, as well as a large porcelain mug filled to the brim, the steam coming from which having already carried a strong, yet calming and succulent caf&#233; aroma around the room. How this didn’t wake Wilt up… his servant <em>is</em> an Assassin, isn’t he?

<em>”I am uncertain as to whether or not the breakfast will be to your liking, but it is what I could find without having to travel too far from the hotel. I believe the vendor called it sweet couscous? In any case, I believe a quick inspection into the doctor’s workings is in order. Please be ready by the time I am back, master.”</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He moved his arms up, allowing himself to stretch them out as he slowly got out of bed, an audible groan eminating from the magus. Sixty dead already was certainly impressive in the short time they had been there, certainly not how he expected his heroic servant to have to do-but the inability to improvise was the death of a Magus. Not finding any signs of a Master or a Servant was hardly unexpected, they likely hadn&#39;t played there hand yet and certainly weren&#39;t going to go around writing their names all over the place or crashing airplanes.

The magus would take a moment to partake in the ambrosia left by his servant, bringing the hot mug up to his mouth-both hands focusing on stablising the cup. Despite the namesake of the familiar he summoned, he had hardly imagined they&#39;d be cooking for him- especially having abandoned any sort of maids or butler on his way to egypt-not wanting to attract any wary eyes and not having any real desire for wealth or the show of it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096285942823788584 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096285942823788584><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 13, 2023 11:08 PM">11:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Wilt would quickly change into of the pairs of clothes laid out for him, more than happy for the process to be as streamlined as can be,not that he took too long deciding what to wear to begin with-being as decisive as can be, taking a bite of the couscous between each article of clothing and finally laying the night gown he was wearing upon the head of the bed folding it into a very tight square. He&#39;d leave the half eaten bowl behind, taking just the coffee and a swig of milk with him, holding the hot cups with both hands. The silent watcher quickly made his way to the door and very <em>carefully</em> opened it, trying not to knock it off it&#39;s hinges any further than what it already was from his own entrance and stepped through. The halls were <em>much</em> more accostumed to the mage, his steps far more confident and much healthier than his first few strolls through them.

He had, frankly, not looked much into the doctor&#39;s work prior. Though healing magecraft was certainly an interesting theory to the magus, he simply had no talent in the art, and regular medicine was similarly inadequate, atop of that- being seen by the patients was a similarly brash action, being a potential accomplice to the shady doctor. Almost ironically, he had ended up following his own Servant&#39;s orders, something he certainly wouldn&#39;t have expected to have been doing prior- but he wasn&#39;t one to complain, especially with a very compotent servant at his call...though assasins were somewhat physically weaker he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about being killed in his sleep, or getting snuck up on by another servant, or being poisoned as long as he was on H.H&#39;s good side at least.

His pace down the stairs were, while not quick, purposed with a long stride to each one, his hands carefully restrained around the cup making sure it wouldn&#39;t spill any of it.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Unfortunately, the usual banes of the class container and HH’s being an anti-hero still haunted the pairing and would continue to do so until the end of the war, whether they liked it or not.

Nonetheless, the moment Wilt reached the bottom of the staircase, he would find himself approached by that same mustachioed, suit-and-tie figure that he was at least somewhat accustomed to seeing now, and - would the mage be so inclined to check - he would find that it was exactly ten minutes after they last conversed.

Which was more disturbing - the serial killer’s chipperness, or the proficiency with which he was playing this friendly role - was up to Wilt to decide. In either case, the serial killer had achieved what little he figured was still to be done at the hotel: Establishing the reason for which Wilt and himself were there to those other than the doctor, given that the cover story for the place was that it was owned by Dr. Florenstine and no longer acted as a regular hotel. Even if the mage had been careful in avoiding the prying eyes of the patients that now roamed the building, the lobby had been transformed into a waiting room of sorts, making it impossible to avoid them completely without some form of magecraft or a heavy distraction unless a window was used for a hasty and potentially dangerous exit. His Servant was well prepared for this, and it was his semi-loud proclamation that served to cause those watching them to just as quickly ignore them instead.

Without so much as a response, the serial killer - whose disguise seemed to be holding up quite well at the moment - would turn to the front door and begin walking at a brisk pace.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was perhaps too casual, and certainly a strange time to try and pick off random vagabonds within the street. Perhaps there was something he needed to show him, or a clue to where the next master could be? He couldn&#39;t be sure, and here certainly wasn&#39;t the place to be asking him about the holy grail war, surrounded by injured people.

&quot;Yes, It truly is a shame. I think that would be best. Fresh air, that is.&quot; 

He quickly absconded from the waiting room, though still a pace behind the servant which had chosen to hide himself within plain sight. He had in part considered hopping from one of the second floor windows, but the act seemed far more costly, and more likely to be seen, than a few sick people seeing him and his certain had asked for him within the lobby

As they breached the door, letting theirselves out into Berenice, Wilt gave a glance towards assasin, manuevering to his side as he casually began to speak to him alloud. &quot;Where are we heading?&quot; It was casual enough conversation, and certainly didn&#39;t need to be mentally broadcasted or so he assumed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Have you ever heard of a man by the name of Asa Gray?”

Instead of responding with a direct answer, Wilt’s servant dared answer back with a question.

“He happened to be the very first paid <em>and</em> permanently-positioned professor at the University of Michigan - the very same institution at which I earned the title of ‘doctor’ - though I must say I find the fact that such a pious man became a professor of the sciences rather laughable, if not severely ironic. Despite my ramblings, it is my belief that he is quite famous, given the notoriety of his works and those of his contemporaries, though one can never be sure of what history holds for your name and what fame or infamy you are regarded by, if any. Whatever the case, I do hope he makes for a believable True Name.” 

What was the purpose of bringing up some random name? What was the serial killer planning, and why was he being strangely secret about it? Did he want Wilt to figure out what it was, or did the man have something else in mind?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite his constant worries, it almost seemed like the serial killer was enjoying his time in the sun, taking the occasional break from scanning about in order to take in the many sights of both Berenice and the beautiful morning sky.

“The Throne stores more than heroes - which I’m sure you’ve realized by now - though I suppose you’re correct in more ways than I wish to ponder at the moment. As for that… I’ve my reasons. A plan, in fact. One that requires by all means that I am <em>not</em> identified, yet requires that I give a plausible name, one more plausible than a simple ‘Pratt’.”

 Wilt’s servant would suddenly stop, pivoting on one foot to turn to his master. 

“If there’s one useful thing I ever learned, it’s that knowing the right people tends to get you more than you ever bargained for, especially if those people happen to be the ones in power. “

Having finally answered his Master’s question (in his mind, at least), HH would pivot right back to face the direction they were previously traveling, continuing on their path to the destination of said plan.

“…You’re aware of simple prayers and the such, are you not? I doubt it really matters on your end, but I’ve found that being able to relate to those you are attempting to fool into a partnership tends to bring about better results.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;d stop as his servant does, intially confused at the proposition. There weren&#39;t many people in power, besides the church of course-but it wasn&#39;t exactly easy to get into their good graces of them (and especially trying to get them to break their oath.) 

He had certainly been against the idea of heading to the church, even if it was seemingly a safe haven amongst the city. Had he perhaps a stronger hold on the city, he himself would have watched the people coming in and out of the church, scrounging for information, and it wouldn&#39;t be a stretch to assume other masters would do the same as well as the murderer he had in tow. But H.H was elusive ,seemingly haviing a plan, and that was enough for Wilt to at least give it a shot.

&quot;I know a few, not well of course.&quot; Many routes of magecraft were deeply engrained in religion, and that Wilt did have his aresenal of knowledge. &quot;I can play the part, in any case.&quot; He wasn&#39;t entirely sure of what Holmes end goal was, but he figured that his answer would soon reveal itself, or he himself would-as he often did.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Grail War had started, but to Gabriele, it was just another Saturday. Normally, he would be working the crops. Sowing seeds for future harvests. However, sister Rosula had forbade him that, perhaps out of pride or shame. She insisted that it was her duty to tend to the garden, since Gabriele and Andreas were guests from afar.

Speaking of Andreas, he was currently missing, most likely busy setting up preparations for the Holy Grail War. He had already placed protective wards around the Berenice church, preventing passerby and non mages from noticing it, while simultaneously making it easier for the Grail War participants to notice it. But Andreas&#39; troubles did not end there, for he had lots of work to do: Not only did he have to prepare suitable cover stories for the stray deaths that had surrounded the island in the past week, but he also had to account for Ruler&#39;s presence. Truly, this was an arduous challenge for him.

Gabriele was only there as an enforcer. Someone to call in things went awry. In a sense, this was more like a relaxing vacation to him than an actual job. He should be pleased.

Yet he wasn&#39;t.

<em>&quot;Rook to A4.&quot;</em>

Memories of last week were still burned into his mind. While Rosula was breaking her back over the garden and Andreas was setting up wards, Gabriele stayed inside and kept Ruler company. They had many talks, usually involving board games, since the Servant couldn&#39;t seem to get enough of them.

They played chess, checkers, go, mahjong, UNO, battleship. Gabriele hadn&#39;t won a single game. Anytime Ruler decided that he would act a certain way, it was impossible for him to stray from the chosen path.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096903308846842026 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096903308846842026><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 4:02 PM">4:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
There was nothing inherently wrong with that. It was highly improbable for a human to beat a Heroic Spirit at a wide variety of things. Yet Gabriele felt perturbed all the same. Clairvoyance was one thing, but what Ruler did felt beyond that. It didn&#39;t feel like seeing the future, more so knowing that there was only one type of future available.

It wasn&#39;t impossible for a human to make predictions of that kind. Through knowledge, logic and reasonable assumptions, even a human could &#39;predict the future&#39;. Weather reports, gambling theory, the stock market: Humanity had constantly found ways to see ahead, for that was the biggest advantage a human could have.

But Ruler went far beyond that. They could make predictions that were lacking in knowledge, logic and reason. They could make guesses with no basis and have them happen. The world was an open book to them, and to Gabriele, that was scary. He knew Heroic Spirits were amazing, but something about Ruler unnerved him greatly.

<em>&quot;Nel nome del padre, del figlio, e dello Spirito Santo-&quot;</em> Gabriele recited his morning prayers, storing away his thoughts into a deep crevice of his mind. It was his coping mechanism to give himself to God anytime logic overwhelmed him. A human mind could not be dictated by that alone or they would overload. At least, that&#39;s what he believed.

Once he was done, he headed down to have breakfast. Rosula&#39;s bruschetta was dry due to the hot Berenice sun, but he could live with it. He downed it with some water and headed outside, smelling the garden and seeing the nun already hard at work. He admired her silently, wondering why his brothers back at Rome weren&#39;t as diligent with field work.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1096903368024268971 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1096903368024268971><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 15, 2023 4:02 PM">4:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He then wandered around, exploring more of the church&#39;s surroundings. He had already seen it thoroughly, but every scan revealed something new. The building&#39;s lacking interior, for example, that required quite a bit of renovation. The lack of funds in Rosula&#39;s tip jar and the church coffers. It was clear that the Berenice church was lacking in funds. No wonder he hadn&#39;t seen any clergy that knew of the Holy Church&#39;s true nature, beyond him and Andreas.

&quot;Recorded.&quot; He muttered to himself, fingers running across his circuits as he stored that information. &quot;I&#39;m sure sister Rosula will appreciate a letter to the Vatican asking for a transfer of funds to Berenice. Shouldn&#39;t have trouble setting something up for her.&quot; 

Gabriele then returned to the garden, noticing that Rosula was no longer there. Most likely working on something else. He wondered why he had come back, before remembering that there was someone else he was looking for. Someone he hadn&#39;t seen since the morning.

&quot;He&#39;s not here.&quot; Andreas had already left, doing God knows what. Gabriele looked frustrated: He hadn&#39;t told his colleague about his worries regarding Ruler yet, but now seemed like the time. Maybe he was being irrational, but there was something incredibly off-putting about the Servant, not to mention the murders that followed suit. The Holy Grail War had just started: Were Servants always so bloodthirsty, or were the Masters not involved in the recent slaughter?

Gabriele pondered, leaning on a wall next to the church&#39;s gate. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The last bit of interaction between the two during their walk would be a single nod from the Assassin in recognition of his Master’s response to the various questions asked. Eventually, the busy streets would turn quiet. Finally, without anyone in view, the serial killer would slip into a dark alleyway, urging Wilt to do the same with a quick and silent signaling motion. 

<em>”I would like us to stay hidden until the Church is in view. It should only be a short skip and a hop until we are to reach our destination, Master Wilt. Remember, I am the Caster Ada Gray, a Christian botanist. If you wish to come up with another guise for yourself as well, now would be the appropriate time.”</em>

Slowing his pace, HH would take his time scanning the area while focusing on magical energy readings, doing his best to make sure there weren’t going to be any other Church visitors that would prefer to harass the Assassin duo than to make their way to what the serial killer could only figure to be the holiest place on the island. How sickening. In any case, it was more than likely that there were those who preferred to divine the area around it to scout out opponents such as themselves… but what use would it be if the information they gathered was completely falsified? They’d learn what Wilt looked like, at the very most.

He didn&#39;t know <em>what</em> Assassin could do to tempt the priest, they didn&#39;t exactly have much leverage, but there <em>was</em> plenty for them to gain. The church could see more of the inner workings of the war than the contestants ever could, and with various masters checking in with the church-it could give them a well earned one up on the rest. He just had to trust in the plan, and so he would.

An alias <em>could</em> be helpful, but if his own track record has shown anything it was that he was poor at lying. If he wanted to get the trust of the priest, he ought to at least be <em>mostly</em> truthful especially if he couldn&#39;t lie. A bit of truth mixed in with a lot of mistrust could certainly be useful in it&#39;s own right (especially with someone so poor at lying.) It wasn&#39;t like his family was especially well known, only vague connections to very obscure companies and an involvement in the clock tower many, many years ago. His name wouldn&#39;t divulge much, true or not. Wilt&#39;s status as a nobody would once again be turned into a boon.

Wilt kept up with the slow pace of his assassin, as he sniffed out potential threats in the area, casually sipping at his coffee all the while. As the servant put his arm out, he followed him into the same defensive position. His gaze rested upon the priest, and looked him up and down attempting to get any sort of read on the man, and then to the church. It was hardly impressive, as far as Wilt could tell- he had assumed the church would have gotten some sort of assistance from the highers ups, having to deal with the Holy Grail and all, but perhaps that would draw too many eyes...or perhaps they were simply more frugal than Wilt had given the Holy Church credit for.

Where was it that he got such a thing? Easy. He stole it from one of Dr. Florenstine’s patients.

Continuing, the Assassin would step out of the alleyway, calling out to the man leaning against the Church’s gate as he did so. It wasn’t quite a shout, but wasn’t exactly quiet either, yet, as always, his tone was nothing but polite.

Wilt certainly didn&#39;t seem to stick out much compared to his servant, quiet and certainly much less of a pillar of fashion than him.

HH would reply to Gabriele’s initial inquiry with his head down and eyes closed for but a moment, trying to make it appear as though he abhorred what was taking place. Wilt, on the other hand, would simply affirm Gabriele as to his position in the war before brushing past, causing the sharply-dressed man to take a moment in order to stop himself from shooting a glaring glance at his young Master. 

“Ah, yes, thank you, Father-?”

A name was a good thing to get. It made conversation flow easier, and made everyone feel that much more familiar with one another. As long as Wilt remembered the name the serial killer was to go by here and didn’t attempt to come up with a false name for himself on the spot, giving their names in return would be just as simple.

The serial killer would continue closer to the Church, moving to slip inside the open gate, his young Master trailing ahead as HH stopped for a brief moment to speak with the holy man. As he did, however, any amount of focused observation would make it apparent to the executor that something was wrong with HH’s appearance. Though he would feel as if he were seeing a normal, everyday man in sharp dress… but there was nothing of note about him. In fact, it would feel as if the holy man <em>couldn’t</em> take note of his appearance even if he wanted to, as if there were some sort of mental block preventing it. If there was anything that would throw Gabriele off, it would be this strange function of the Assassin’s Presence Concealment.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097358348577419375 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097358348577419375><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 16, 2023 10:10 PM">10:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Stepping inside of the Church - which HH would quickly note as being just as dingy, if not dingier, than the pair’s own headquarters in the city - he would stop to stare at the largest holy symbol in the room.

To them, it was surprising. To Gabriele, it was simply standard overseer procedure: No Master should be turned away, unless they were a strict enemy of the Holy Church. Of course, Andreas was the one supposed to tend to that, but that&#39;s what brothers were for.

&quot;A pleasure to meet you. I can only hope the war has been pleasant for you thus far.&quot; Gabriele said with a nod towards Wilt. It felt like he was acknowledging the boy&#39;s age, realizing that it took a certain kind of mettle to willingly participate in such a slaughter. &quot;I assume your friend over there is your Servant, then. Certainly not a knight in shining armor.&quot; The priest slipped out, but they didn&#39;t seem to mind voicing their opinions in public. In fact, it sounded more like they were simply stating the truth.

&quot;Gabriele.&quot; He added. &quot;Brother Gabriele. I am but a humble assistant of this Grail War&#39;s overseer. I believe I am not worthy enough of the title of Father, but I appreciate your politeness.&quot; The executor said with a light bow, catching H.H. off guard. It was a practiced and well executed maneuver, something that rivalled even him in terms of etiquette. Gabriele truly gave the aura of a professional, which elicited some worries: Could they really fool a master in the profession?

&quot;A scientist? I suppose that explains your appearance: You seem rather recent.&quot; Gabriele continued on. He certainly wasn&#39;t wrong: Few people would have called themselves scientists back in the day. &quot;But even the stone the builder refused turned into the essential cornerstone. Psalm 118:22.&quot; The priest smiled. 

&quot;A once holy man can always return to their roots, regardless of how and when they were rejected. Please, friend, speak up.

If anything, Assassin would take a mental note of the holy man’s candidness. 

HH would put his hands together and bow his head slightly in falsified prayer for a few moments before turning back to Gabriele, who - to the serial killer’s surprise - was bowing to him. Many a pretender would have had their very soul frozen solid by such a display, but HH was more than just a proficient liar. Lying was to him as breathing was to the living. He was a man of many lives, many names, many faces. This manifestation of his ‘self’ was, in fact, nothing more than an amalgamation of rumors and lies. Wilt may have been given some pause, but the serial killer would find only solace in meeting a <em>somewhat</em> like-minded individual.

Instead of reflecting any sort of worry, the sharply dressed man would smile slightly in acknowledgement of the information he’d gained about the executor before bowing himself, matching the man’s grace and level of execution. 

On the flip side, the serial killer was internally grimacing at the idea that they’d picked some church boy to approach rather than the Grail War’s true overseer. HH would acknowledge that there was still something to be gained here despite this, deciding to continue on as if he had nothing but their conversation in mind.

The serial killer would look over to his much younger counterpart, nodding in approval of Wilt speaking the name that the serial killer had chosen for himself for this very moment. As for the priest, HH would smile back at him as much as he could without resulting in the inhuman overextending of his lips.

“Now that introductions are out of the way, speak up I shall: It is for that very reason that me and my master have come to see you. It is my wish to return to the faith, and to make up for the sins of my past life, but I fear that simple prayer will do little to redeem my soul, for it was my failure in preventing the spread of blasphemy that led to many abandoning Our Lord and Savior.

Despite his...distaste for conversation, it was crucial for him to at least engage the priest-even if he was not the overseer he was looking for. One simply couldn&#39;t climb to the top, skipping all the steps regardless of how broad their strides were. This was a start, and they <em>wanted</em> that bad.

&quot;It is good to meet you, Brother.&quot;

He copies the bow that the priest had taken earlier, lacking the same level of refinement that Gabriele had- stiff and unskilled in great contrast to the more well practiced but it seemed polite enough to the younger man...though he&#39;d be quickly outdone by his own servant-but likely took eyes off of his own lack of manners.

&quot;He is effective, if not self conscious.&quot; His lie was laced with the same monotone which had evidently infected the rest of what he said, and his lack of any real look planted upon his face made it similarly obscure. Luckily, he hadn&#39;t the need to fake <em>who</em> he was-making this significantly easier than his attempts at persuading the doctor.

As H.H shedded the visage he had adopted prior, he had assumed there was some sort of interference from the outside. Perhaps some other servant saw to it that he had been expos-No, H.H was far too consise to allow something like that, and he was far too calm now to have been placed in a predicament like that. Wilt&#39;s slight shock was met with a nod, one which could easily be mistaken with understanding-but rather simply that he picked up on the killer&#39;s cue, and his face returned to normalcy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1097759713619365928 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1097759713619365928><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 12:45 AM">12:45 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Of course.&quot; He&#39;d turn towards Gabrielle. &quot;This is Caster, perhaps better known as Asa Gray.&quot; He&#39;d then follow it up. &quot;I am Wilt Losfeld, his master.&quot; 

He&#39;d place his hand in his pocket, watching for any sort of expression or emotion to appear upon the executioners face and ultimately a response to his own servant&#39;s request. It was, frankly, bold to even request something like that from someone of the offical church- even if they were not the head of the operation. Though with a slight glance towards the rather decrepit church, perhaps the main association was more hands off with this go around. He couldn&#39;t be sure, not without expanded insight on the situation, but it seemed like a promising step forward in their plan-and potentially something they could exploit later.

Wilt was certainly behind on the details of this plan, but had to trust H.H&#39;s guise enough, and more problematically keep up his own, to at least get theirselves into the good graces of the father.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That didn&#39;t mean that he was docile: He was already at work, listening closely to H.H. and Wilt&#39;s words as he recorded all of that information into his own circuits. The analysis could come later, for now he could simply address their concerns and keep note of what people participating in the Grail War were experiencing.

Of course, no amount of caution could have prepared him for Wilt&#39;s bombshell. &quot;Asa Gray? That is quite the name. I didn&#39;t expect one of the world&#39;s most notable botanists to be summoned here.&quot; The priest said with a smile. &quot;I remember you from books in Rome. Quite the arduous life that must have been, exploring uncharted territory while being persecuted by your own brothers. No wonder you believe to harbor uncountable sins.&quot;

Gabriele did a small prayer as a gesture of goodwill, as if absolving &#39;Asa&#39; of their sins. It seemed like a nice, friendly gesture. If only it weren&#39;t for Gabriele&#39;s inquisitive eyes.

&quot;Though, as a Heroic Spirit, I am surprised to find you here. I can fully understand why you feel like you have sinned, but as a participant in the Holy Grail War, I am sure you know of what can absolve you of the sins of the past.&quot; The priest&#39;s voice sounded a lot more stern. 

<strong>&quot;The Holy Grail</strong> is within reach. Surely you know that much? Is this proposal of yours perhaps related to that?&quot; Gabriele pocketed his hands, assuming a far more relaxed stance.

HH would lightly shake his head, communicating his (faked) dissatisfaction with himself for (faking) getting so excited to the priest. There was probably something rather strange with the way ‘Asa’ was acting, given that the serial killer had never actually interacted with the man despite his knowledge of him, forcing HH to rely strictly on how he believed a man such as Gray would act in this situation.

Upon Gabriele’s tone becoming harsher, HH would then be forced into faking a sort of discomfort with his expression. Alas, it was a face that he’d practiced numerous times for similar situations, though the robotic nature of the way his facial muscles moved could prove discernible to the eye of a man such as Gabriele. He’d also failed to make a single movement with his body - breathing included - though it was possible to mistake such a peculiarity for pure nervousness.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098083635246153829 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098083635246153829><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 10:12 PM">10:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>HH was a man of words more than a man of action. A saving grace, one could call it.

“Despite the shortcomings in my knowledge of the arcane, I find it rather hard to believe that even an artifact as holy and powerful as the Holy Grail has the power to sway the divine judgment of my soul. If I am to drag this young man into a fight for our lives, during which we may have to commit all sorts of atrocities named and unnamed, there must be something I can do that will provide a more solid basis for my acceptance into Heaven. Brother Gabriele, what I propose is indeed related to the Holy Grail, but not in the way I believe you may be insinuating.”

A moment of silence. Of consideration. Now was the time, and what was about to be said needed to be worded as carefully as possible. The serial killer would lower himself to his knees in front of Gabriele, as if kneeling in prayer. Clasping his hand, bowing his head, and closing his eyes, the demonic anti-hero spirit now appeared to be begging something of the holy man. Pride was of no matter to HH. He would do anything it took to win, even if it meant something like this, or worse. Even if it sickened him to the core. What was left to sicken, anyway…</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098083685078667304 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098083685078667304><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 18, 2023 10:12 PM">10:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“What I seek more so than the Grail itself is the return of a Relic of the Son of God to its rightful place. <strong>Were Wilt and myself to win the Holy Grail, it would be delivered right into the hands of the war’s overseer</strong>, something the two of us agreed upon the founding of our contract.

Their body language truly inspired forgiveness. Their words made them seem regretful and their intentions were pure. Were Sister Rosula the one to witness this, she would have most likely accepted the man&#39;s proposal, if only out of goodwill.

But Gabriele was different. His devotion was far more profound than a need for forgiveness or regrets in the past. He worshipped God because in his eyes, it was the most logical thing to do. Asa Gray was a famous botanist and a talented scholar, surely they knew that God was more than just a well to pour your regrets in?

The mention of a relic was even more suspicious, Gabriele instinctively noting it down in his circuits in the blink of an eye. While H.H. performed, he recorded the whole exchange in his body, saving it for future use. The mannerisms were on point and the intention was pure, but it was clear that little oddities were starting to pile up.

&quot;I find that truly admirable.&quot; Gabriele replied, kneeling down slightly as he clasped his own hands around Asa Gray&#39;s palms. &quot;Your devotion to God, even as a Servant, is beyond I ever imagined. I had never expected for someone who has already died to still believe in our creator from above.&quot; The priest said with a serene smile.

&quot;It would be a sin for me to not assist in your repentance. That is why I&#39;ll offer you some words of wisdom.&quot; Gabriele rose up, his words most likely eliciting hope in H.H. and Wilt. Their plan had bore fruit and the priest seemed ready to turn into their keys to the Grail.

&quot;The truth is, <strong>this is not an ordinary Grail War.</strong> Unlike the previous ones, we have an additional Servant lurking around that is beyond the seven classes. They are known as <strong>Ruler</strong>. You may know them from magus textbooks or other research notes at the Clock Tower.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098696119644590131 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098696119644590131><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 2:46 PM">2:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
The two would have most likely not expected such a bombshell to come from the priest. It was knowledge that went beyond their wildest expectations. &quot;For now, I have treated them as a fellow overseer of the Grail War. However, I suspect their involvement is a bit more than that. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Ruler knew where the Holy Grail were located or where it would be destined to manifest. After all, the Class itself is deeply linked to the Grail.&quot; Gabriele added. The priest started lecturing H.H. and Wilt on Ruler more, pacing himself around the two in circles like a hawk around their nest.

&quot;I attempted to pry the information myself, but as a human being, my methods are very limited. Ruler is also only cooperative when necessary. I do not blame them for that, since it keeps this war impartial. I suspect, however, that if the Grail War were to progress smoothly, then Ruler would be forced to start their preparations for the Grail&#39;s arrival. In other words, they would give away its location. I am sure you understand what I mean.&quot;

Gabriele then stopped, standing right behind the Master-Servant pair.

&quot;To sum it up, if you were to survive the Grail War long enough, you might potentially see Ruler make their move. Of course, there are also various other alternatives, albeit riskier ones. The direct approach brings the highest reward. If you were to observe or confront Ruler on your own, perhaps they might reveal something to clue you in on themselves or the Grail.&quot;

The priest turned around, staring at the church&#39;s entrance. He slid his hands down the metal gate, slightly opening it.

&quot;That is, unfortunately, all I can do as a humble man of the cloth. The only other information I can offer you is Ruler&#39;s whereabouts: They are currently not at the church.&quot; He pushed a bit more, fully opening the gate. &quot;But their presence can be felt throughout the island. I&#39;m sure a Servant would be more adept at tracking them down than me.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098696214574272723 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098696214574272723><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 20, 2023 2:46 PM">2:46 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Without so much as an audible inhale or exhale, the serial killer would listen carefully to every word the priest said and how he said it. Even the revelation of Ruler’s existence wouldn’t draw any sort of reaction from the man, who held his position of prayer for some time in allowing Gabriele to grant them every bit of knowledge he would allow the Master-Servant pair. 

If he were upset at the fact that the executor’s offer in return for the Grail was limited to information, or that the two of them were being so openly scrutinized, there was no sign of it. Instead, “Asa” would slowly stand up once Gabriele opened the entrance to the Church in order for the two of them to leave. It was an obvious sign that they’d get little more from him. 

In the same brisk, businesslike manner with which HH approached the Church, he would make his way to the exit, stopping only once he was within arm’s length of the priest. Bothering not even to look at him, the serial killer would speak one more time to the priest before making his exit.

“Thank you for everything, Brother Gabriele. May the Lord be with you.”

A mere two sentences was little in return for such a deluge of facts and statements concerning the war. While retaining his politeness, the brisk nature of this exit was comparatively rude in the face of the serial killer’s previous interactions, making it a stunning act for his Master and the priest to witness.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099550489894457395 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099550489894457395><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, April 22, 2023 11:21 PM">11:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Such was the effect of weariness, however. HH had pushed himself to stay in the Church from the beginning of their conversation to the end. An infamous liar, many would consider him a master of the art of deception… but his persuasion skills relied heavily upon his ability to pull a victim’s heartstrings. Heartstrings that Brother Gabriele was rapidly perceived to have in short supply. The fact of the matter was that he was relieved to have made off with anything at all. 

If there was anything the serial killer could say he <em>truly</em> hated, it would be people he could liken to himself, and those who chose to live a life of devotion and piety to “God”. He’d had enough of both for one day.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A Ruler class servant was something that Wilt had certainly researched prior, though he had hardly expected to encounter one himself and the shock that such information was given out with relative ease was certainly palpable. A servant made to assist the grail would certainly be beneficial to have knowledge of, now they just had to find them. It didn&#39;t <em>massively</em> alter their plans for now, supposedly the ruler was going to not weigh too heavily into the war-needing to be impartial to even qualify for such a class-they still had the other masters to deal with in any case.

Knowing where the grail, and by extension the ruler, would form was invaluable , and while he understood Assasin&#39;s haste in wanting to get to it-certainly didn&#39;t expect him to leave so quick-and abruptly at that. He awkwardly would bow to the priest. &quot;Thank you for this, Gabrielle.&quot; Before following his servant out of the church with the same fast pace. They probably couldn&#39;t have gotten anything else from the priest at any case, and they had certainly gotten what  they had come for. 

He looked towards his servant as they began to leave the church, taking a short sip at the cup in his hands once more. He seemed to be attempting to read H.H, somewhat curious if he could have even seen through his lies without the perspective that he already had. Ultimately-his answer was no, he had fooled many more knowledgable and many wiser than himself. &quot;Do you think you can sense the Ruler?&quot; He had very little idea of the sensation of sensing, being mostly incapable of it himself aside from basic sensitivities-but the knowledge that there was something to sense could certainly help.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For but a moment, Wilt would notice a look of great annoyance upon the serial killer’s face, though it would quickly fade into his more usual dead-eyed scowl.

“Not at the moment, Master Wilt. Such would require us being at least somewhat nearby. While I ask that you tell me more about what this so-called ‘Ruler’ class entails whenever we have a good chance for such a discussion… for the time being, there are at least ten future corpses that still need dealing with.”

HH would quickly turn his head upon saying this, looking back towards the Church- or, more specifically, the gate through which they entered and exited the one place a person could escape from his blades. He’d have given little thought to looking back if it weren’t for their recent interaction with that damned priest weighing on the serial killer’s mind. If anything, it was to make sure he wasn’t standing in earshot of them. Not that there was anything they could do if he was, a fact that served to frustrate the generally emotionless man even further.

“Say, are there any other such holy places on this island? It would be quite the waste not to expand upon our spiritual horizons. Any faith will do.”

While anyone in earshot would take him word for word, Wilt would know better. HH was asking for a place to hunt. One where he’d be able to take out his ‘religious frustrations’ upon the world, victim by victim.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

I doubt many have been eliminated-and certainly not enough to begin to manifest the grail.&quot; Unless someone had been <em>very</em> efficient in their dealing with of other servants-it seemed like fairly smooth sailing for the two. A slightly less lethal, but equally profitable goal awaiting them.

Wilt would nod, explaining the role of a ruler would be easy enough- but the priest certainly had revealed enough of its role for the sheer weight of what the benefits were to sink in. He&#39;d think for a moment, the map of Berenice slowly forming within his minds eye. &quot;There should be another church, it&#39;s a big enough island for plenty of establishments like this.&quot;

He sipped at his coffee, gazing back towards the church. The brother had given up the information extremely easily-almost uneasily so, the church had chosen them to simply arbitrate the war. But he had no reason to lie to the two, and sending the duo on some sort of goose chase would also not bear much fruit...unless he decided to simply get his kicks off watching them struggle to find them.

His annoyance was very noticeable to the Magus, and even with his general inability to understand others-the cause of it was very apparent to him. &quot;Do not act rashly.&quot; His eyes seemed to blankly stare at the killer, his body as relaxed as usual-but what tone did deep into his voice was clear. His trust in H.H, while strong-he was a reliable and very calculating, was not absolute. &quot;I trust you&#39;ll be able to do it cleanly, yes?&quot; There had been a fair amount of people going missing, none of which could be tied to them...but in H.H&#39;s venting...as far as Wilt was concerned slip ups weren&#39;t unlikely. But it was better he get them out here than linger on them, professional or not-especially if it was as productive as the rest of the kills so far.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1101371642443214919 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1101371642443214919><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 27, 2023 11:57 PM">11:57 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Hed awkwardly pull out his flip phone, bringing it up very close to his eye  with both hands-before flipping it back into his pocket.

Gabriele gave a light nod. He said goodbye to &#39;Asa&#39; and Wilt, watching them leave as he slowly closed back the church door. He promptly locked it, slowly and methodically. 

&quot;Some souls require salvation to be purified. A man like Asa Gray, one who caused a rift between creeds, could possibly require that.&quot; The priest muttered to themselves, turning around as they breathed in the fresh aroma of the garden leaves. 

&quot;The possibility of that being the case is <strong>30%.&quot;</strong> He stated bluntly. &quot;But the possibility of Asa Gray discovering something about Ruler, a fellow Servant-&quot;

<strong>&quot;69%.&quot;</strong> Gabriele slicked his hair back, exuding confidence. He had finally found a weapon: A knife to cut through Ruler&#39;s skin and reveal the secrets underneath. He didn&#39;t see it as lying, nor as him plotting a wicked scheme. In his eyes, he was simply following the most banal human instinct: Curiosity.

Was Ruler evil? Were they good? Those questions filled his mind with unease ever since he had entered the Church. That confident aura, those accurate predictions. It was like he had come face to face not with a Servant, but with a God.

But there was only one <em>true</em> God. To prove that hypothesis, Ruler&#39;s true nature had to be revealed.

<em>DING-DONG DING-DONG</em>

The priest took one strong look at the church bell, staring at intently. It was noon, meaning that the countdown to night had now started. Sister Rosula would most likely need some assistance with dinner. So, without saying a word, Gabriele moved on, his heart weary but his mind free. All that he could think of was the joy of revealing Ruler&#39;s true colors. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
