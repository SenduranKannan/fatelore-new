His wound was still bleeding, though it had slowed to a crawl thanks to all the <strong>healing magecraft</strong> he and Roland had piled on over the flesh. Innards still hung delicately from their linings, occasionally poking through the gash when he moved. It was a gruesome sight. Even butchers, who handled livestock on a daily basis, exercised greater caution than he did.

But he refused to be treated like mere livestock, squealing on the ground when met with their end. Nor did he consider himself to be a butcher, hunchbacked over countless corpses, pouring water over freshly cut meat. He was neither. And so, he rose to his feet, and stepped out of the car.

&#39;Get my tools,&#39; he spoke calmly, even though his pupils remained dilated, smothering grey irises from within.

&#39;Roland,&#39; he called out feverishly, but the blonde was nowhere to be seen. It took a moment for him to remember that he had sent Roland to keep watch as he recuperated.

<em>Which remains...</em>

&#39;Open the trunk, Bill.&#39; He commanded with unprecedented calm, and slapped his hand against the car for support when he nearly tripped over flat ground. A few inches of intestine slid out of his wound. He really shouldn&#39;t be moving about.

&#39;Tools, now,&#39; he said, sliding down to sit with his back against the car.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110347489191669891 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110347489191669891><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:24 PM">6:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He looked worse for wear, hand still trembling a bit and his shoulder missing portions. Despite sitting, he towered above the dying Lachlan, who could barely remain standing.

Bill glared. He then stood up, heading to the car trunk and grabbing a leather bag from it. It looked rugged and weathered. When he opened it up, he was greeted by even more messier insides. Surgical tools, bandages, wipes and drugs of all kind. A miniature collection of life and death.

He tossed the bag back to the car&#39;s hood, loud enough for Lachlan to notice.

&quot;Go on. Fetch it. It&#39;s right there.&quot; Bill said with a hint of laughter. It was just a few steps away from Lachlan, but he knew that it required a monumental effort for him to keep moving. &quot;Or can you not even do that?

A surge of mana coursed through Bill&#39;s body like a bribe, coalescing around the gaping hole in his shoulder. Almost immediately, he felt relief, as if a warm compress had been applied over the wound. Slowly but perceptibly, his flesh began to mend, as his spiritrons replenished themselves with the fresh supply of mana.

&#39;Don&#39;t want to lose your meal ticket now,&#39; Lachlan spoke softly, his head tilting back to a more comfortable angle as he met Archer in the eye. Slowly, he struck a thumb towards himself. &#39;I&#39;m the best you&#39;ve got in a five mile radius.&#39;

Quite the bold claim, given the current number of Masters swarming the island. However, the mana flowing into Bill&#39;s body was nothing to scoff at. It was pure, concentrated, and overflowing with power, holding the promise of complete healing in just a few hours...

That is, <em>if</em> his Master could survive the night. 

&#39;So...what&#39;s it gonna be?&#39; Lachlan implored—or threatened, Bill, depending on how one assessed the situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Of course, that didn&#39;t mean that he was fully happy about it.

&quot;Hah.&quot; The cowboy laughed, letting the boy run their mouth. He got closer, walking back to the hood as he opened up the bag and took out a needle and silk. &quot;I&#39;m not good at this though.

Another day, perhaps. He flipped his hand over, so that his palm faced up.

&#39;Hand it over,&#39; he said, letting his hand drop into his lap. &#39;I&#39;d sooner jump out of an airplane without a parachute,&#39;

<em>&lt;than to trust an unqualified brute with a needle. You can play assistant for now.&gt;</em> He switched to telepathy in the last moment, in an attempt to conserve more strength.

&quot;Didn&#39;t we basically almost do that just days ago? Or was that the joke? Har-har.&quot; He mocked, extending his hand towards the boy&#39;s lap with the needle in hand. He closed it into a fist, about to delicately drop it on his Master&#39;s palm-

&quot;Nope.&quot; Bill quickly pulled his arm back. &quot;You look like shit. Your guts are almost spilling all over the car. You expect me to believe you&#39;re capable of stitching yourself?

Getting Bill to listen had always been a challenge: he often had to resort to coaxing or threatening, as if he were taming a dangerous circus animal. It was a stark contrast to dealing with Roland, who yielded to his authority without much of a fight. On another day, Lachlan might have found the experience refreshing.

But tonight, his patience was wearing thin, much like his blood. Unlike a Servant, he didn&#39;t have an unlimited amount of &#39;life energy&#39; to draw upon. Once he reached his limit, there was no way for him to continue without his body completely shutting down. 

All this dilly-dallying with Bill was only expediting that process.

<em>&lt;Stop messing around,&gt;</em> he warned the Archer. <em>&lt;I&#39;m well aware of my condition, and when I say I don&#39;t trust a brute to treat my wounds, I mean that my wounds are severe enough that I can&#39;t afford to allow the likes of you to try your hands at playing house, then screwing it up. I don&#39;t have nine lives to spare,&gt;</em> he scoffed, his fingers twitching in his lap. <em>&lt;This isn&#39;t my first rodeo. I know what to do.&gt;</em>

It wouldn&#39;t be easy. Or pretty. And he dreaded, every single time, having to perform the same surgical procedure on his own body that he had always done on his puppets. It raised certain questions that he found difficult to face.

Still beats dying in a ditch though. 

<em>&lt;Go on, try me. See if I&#39;m capable or not, eh?&gt;</em> He provoked the Archer. <em>&lt;You love these stupid little games. Why stop now?&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Didn&#39;t mean nothing by it.&quot; Bill replied calmly, playing around with the needle as he balanced it from his index to his pinky. He was just an arm&#39;s length from Lachlan, yet felt no fear. After all, any amount of effort from his Master would have been extremely painful. Unless they used a Command Seal, of course. Was he tempting fate?

&quot;Do you think I was born yesterday? I&#39;ve seen plenty people act tough: I was in a gang, for God&#39;s sake! You think a bunch of thick, bone-headed beasts like us wouldn&#39;t try to constantly one up each other?&quot; He chuckled. &quot;They&#39;d say the boldest of things, while still having the face of a pained dog like yours.&quot; He lurched two fingers forward, pointing right back at Lachlan&#39;s glare.

&quot;Do you still remember what we talked about before the flight? Or are that pissed at getting your pretty boy face ruined? Fucking whimp.&quot; Archer said, both disgusted and amused. &quot;I told you already: I&#39;m in for the big haul. I can&#39;t have my meal ticket dying on me just &#39;cause they thought my sewing skills were subpar.&quot;

As if to reinforce that, he forcibly grabbed Lachlan by the neck, dragging him forward until he could take a closer look at the wounds that required stitches.

<em>drip</em>

Lachlan felt an uncomfortable jolt as his Servant pricked him with the needle, starting the process of sewing up his stomach to prevent intestines from spilling out. It was rough and sloppy, but meticulous in the way that Bill would constantly reapply himself until he was sure that not even a single drop of blood could leave Lachlan&#39;s body. No wonder they called him momma back in the day. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan didn&#39;t even need to use his voice to give Bill a piece of his mind. Telepathy was far more effective than speech, as his own mastery in the skill allowed him to penetrate any mental barricade that Bill could put up, effectively stripping the Archer of any way of shutting him out. Every word he wanted to say would be beamed directly to Bill&#39;s mind, and Bill couldn&#39;t ignore any of it.

It didn&#39;t make his current situation any less humiliating, however.

Being pulled by the neck like he was some runt of the litter. It was a shameful thing, especially since it was his own Servant who had decided that he was helpless, and took it upon himself to stitch up his wounds.

Which was fine, except that the act was a direct violation of his orders and quite literally rubbed salt in the wound of his ego. 

<em>&lt;Let go, idiot.&gt;</em> Lachlan gave Bill a figurative kick in his mind. <em>&lt;Worried about me, are you? Think I&#39;m some helpless bloke from your gang?&gt;</em> He scoffed. <em>&lt;Stop hallucinating. You don&#39;t know a thing about me.&gt;</em>

Unable to see what was happening, he felt around the stitches with his fingers. The sensation he received, however, was nothing short of horrifying.

<em>&lt;For god&#39;s sake, you&#39;re going to kill me if you keep sewing the wound shut like it&#39;s a piece of fabric. This is going go <strong>scar</strong>, and that&#39;s if I&#39;m lucky!&gt;</em> He struggled to free the needle from Bill&#39;s hand. Failing that, he resorted to more drastic measures.

<em>&lt;Drop the needle right now,&gt;</em> he growled. <em>&lt;Or I&#39;ll use a Command Seal and make you snap those fingers one by one.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This twerp was getting on his nerves: How could he even hold his head high after that disastrous showing at the graveyard? Not only had he made an easy kill unnecessarily harder on himself, but he had also thrown away what little of an advantage Bill had by getting himself in trouble like the useless idiot he was.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m shivering. Sorry, your majesty.&quot; Bill joked, needle still in hand. &quot;Ya know, I didn&#39;t get along with those who didn&#39;t follow my orders. Bill Cook especially was a smug asshole about it, constantly doing whatever he pleased and ignoring whatever I said. But you know what? At least he <em>had</em> a plan. What&#39;s yours, to just act like you did no wrong? Why isn&#39;t a Master dead at our feet then? I thought that was <em>your</em> job.&quot;

Lachlan could feel the venom in Bill&#39;s voice, slowly coming out like a snake leaving its lair. The needle trembled as the cowboy stopped sewing, possibly out of fear of scarring Lachlan&#39;s skin. Instead, he reacted the only way he could: Rage.

<em>thwip</em>

Without batting an eye, Bill jammed a gun right up his Master&#39;s mouth, barrel poking right at the boy&#39;s lips and filling him with an iron-y taste. It didn&#39;t prod further than that, remaining perfectly still, yet still pressed on the Dowling&#39;s mouth.

&quot;What&#39;s your plan for this then? Still feel in control? Don&#39;t you realize how small you are, <em>you brat?</em> Think you can take the world on your own?&quot; Bill asked repeatedly, but his questions were erratic and repetitive. It felt less like he was awaiting Lachlan&#39;s response and more that he was probing for something. Something about the boy&#39;s demeanor filled him with disgust and unease. He didn&#39;t know how to react to that, besides the way he always did: With a gun in hand.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110348301246664795 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110348301246664795><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:27 PM">6:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I could pull the trigger right now, and nothing you ever said to me would matter. You must be the most jealous man in the world right now.&quot; Bill giggled with a deranged glare. &quot;Jealous of me, of course. Because in a few seconds, I&#39;ll still be here. And you won&#39;t.&quot;

The gun emitted a resounding <em>clic.</em> Bill&#39;s finger was steady and primed. The line between threat and action was blurring, but Lachlan could tell that the Archer didn&#39;t feel fully satisfied yet.

&quot;Well, what do you have to say to that? Anything at all, really?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan twisted and turned his head but Bill followed him along, bearing pressure with the gun against his lips as he patiently waited for him to open his mouth. 

<em>Speak the forbidden words and you will die.</em>

A death sentence. As blatant and banal as the one-liners heard in the classic Western films. There was a man who had lived and breathed the same code of &#39;kill or be killed&#39; that had dominated the Old West, and it dawned on Lachlan that he was not only up against his Servant, but the trail of violent history that Bill had embodied with every fiber of his being.

His guts churned, and his insides burned both from the haphazard stitches aggravating his flesh and his rage. He suppressed the urge to vomit as blood pounded in his ears, causing him to see shadows dancing at the edge of his vision.

<em>click</em>

The sound of the hammer being drawn back pulled him back to reality. The gun was still pressed against his mouth. Bill was a filthy, uneducated brute who only knew violence. Lachlan, privileged, sheltered, and ordinary, was entirely out of his depth. 

The weight of his own powerlessness bore down on him like a mighty wave, suffocating, relentless. Familiar.

<em>You know what you have to do...</em>

In moments like this, when he was reduced to little more than a wounded animal, trapped and cornered and at the mercy of another, there was ever only one option. 

Submission.

He lowered his head. 

<em>&lt;Nothing at all,&gt;</em> he managed to stammer out the words. <em>&lt;Sir.&gt;</em>

That&#39;s right. Be passive. Show no threat, no resistance, and earn the chance to walk away alive.

<em>&lt;It was my fault. I overreacted. Shouldn&#39;t have lashed out like that.&gt;</em> He continued, pushing a bit more earnestness into his voice. <em>&lt;You&#39;re a notorious outlaw, feared by many. Me? I&#39;m just...a nobody.&gt;</em>

He closed his eyes, hoping that the begging would work.

Saloons, banks and trains were filled with plenty of asskissers. Women moaning for their children to be spared, men talking about how they had families back at home. Amusing sights were to behold when you had all the power in the world. The power to decide whether someone could live or die, resulting in a dancing troupe of clowns showing their true selves in an effort to save their own skin.

Bill rarely went beyond threats. Usually a beating or two if he was having a bad day. Lachlan&#39;s whimpering, however, filled him with a sense of unease. Even though his &#39;Master&#39; was now behaving like a submissive mouse, he still didn&#39;t feel the same joy that he did back in the day. This did not feel like domination. It felt like pure bullying. The difference was minor, but significant enough to tick him off.

&quot;...Is this how you plan on winning the Grail War? Just sucking me off the moment I even stand up to you?!&quot; Bill whipped Lachlan&#39;s forehead with the tip of his gun. Lightly since the boy was still injured, but furious all the same. His rage was palpable, but even he didn&#39;t know why he felt that way. Lachlan&#39;s sudden change in demeanor disgusted him, but he couldn&#39;t tell why.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110348442095603772 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110348442095603772><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:28 PM">6:28 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Guess you&#39;re no different than a mutt, then. Willing to throw away your morals and values the moment a bigger wolf shows up. What a joke.&quot; Bill looked back, expecting a defiant glare back. Instead, Lachlan&#39;s eyes were still closed and the Dowling heir looked as pathetic as ever.

Great, now he felt pissed off at himself. This wasn&#39;t the act of dominance he had envisioned. There was a difference between holding power over others and exerting it. He instinctively hid his glare through his cowboy hat in shame. Why did he feel ashamed? Was it not this brat&#39;s fault that they were in this perilous situation in the first place? It was a simple job, a plain old assassination, yet Lachlan had already done plenty to block his line of work.

His Master deserved to be punished. Then why did he dislike being the punisher?

&quot;Whatever.&quot; Bill gave up on thinking. He wasn&#39;t born smart enough to discuss matters of the heart. &quot;You&#39;re still my Master, so just listen to me you little bitch. If you do, then the Grail will be ours in no time. Ya get me?&quot; He lowered his pistol and tapped Lachlan on the shoulder. A kind gesture, were it not for the manipulative tone behind his words. If playing bad cop felt sour, then maybe good cop would raise both Bill and Lachlan&#39;s spirits. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

God knew what gave him the strength to endure such humiliation, but in the face of certain death, anyone would do the same, right?

As the gun left his skin, he took a huge breath, allowing the rush of oxygen to fill his lungs.

&#39;I&#39;ll do whatever...it takes to win,&#39; he spoke slowly, as he unstuck his clenched jaw. &#39;Anything you want me to do...I can be a good dog...far better than the Cooks ever were.&#39;

He croaked and sputtered through those words, working his vocal cords and clearing his throat every few words to make sure they still functioned properly. The effort was clearly taking a toll on him, but he pushed through the discomfort all the same. Perhaps this was how he was meant to show his compliance...

<em>&lt;But what makes you so confident that we&#39;ll get the Grail?&gt;</em>

Or perhaps not. Perhaps that was the extent of his vocal strength, as the puppeteer immediately switched to telepathy next.

&quot;Good boy.&quot; Bill replied with both reassurance and amusement. All horses were designed to break, be it through whips or spurs. Even the Dowling had a breaking point, it seemed. That sense of unease was gradually leaving his conscience, or maybe he just felt like stuffing it inside a closet and tuning it out.

&quot;You&#39;re still useful to me. So let&#39;s be useful to each other, okay?&quot; He said, before feeling another prodding in his mind. His Master had returned to his usual manner of speaking.

&quot;You really gotta ask? C&#39;mon now,&quot; Bill relaxed his gun, twirling it around. &quot;if our goal is to kill every Master in this sorry ass Grail War, then we&#39;ll do exactly that. You know what I&#39;m capable of: My first shot will never miss. <em>Never.</em> Give me one good shot at a Master and you&#39;ll have their head.&quot; He boasted, pumping his chest out as he adjusted his hat. Despite the fight against Lancer, Bill&#39;s spirits were high. Lachlan couldn&#39;t tell if that was confidence or foolishness.

&quot;It could have worked great here, ya know? You got quite the potty mouth. Grabbed the attention of that voodoo guy real quick.&quot; Archer was most likely referring to the Adler heir. &quot;If you had just given me the okay-&quot; He grunted, biting his lip in disappointment.

&quot;See, this is what I don&#39;t damn understand: What is it with you sadists? Can&#39;t you focus on the prize at hand before indulging in your weird fetishes?

A noticeable vein could be seen on his forehead, something that often appeared when he could smell a bank teller&#39;s bullshit or a saloon owner&#39;s bias. Lachlan could sound as suave as he wanted to, but the outlaw was not pleased.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that then? Not my business, is it?!&quot; The cowboy snarled. This is why he hated Bill Cook at times. Always with the big plans, but kept them close to his chest.

&quot;A warning would have been nice, but I guess you didn&#39;t think of that. Just like how you completely ditched this so-called &#39;plan&#39; of yours the moment your face got scratched.&quot; Archer huffed out hot air, breathing down Lachlan&#39;s neck.

&quot;Don&#39;t act like I didn&#39;t notice. You were howling like a bloodhound, begging me to put a bullet in that Adler guy&#39;s skull. Don&#39;t try worming your way out of this one, &#39;cause we both know it&#39;s true.&quot;

He grabbed the boy by the collar as he inspected his wounds. He wasn&#39;t even sure if stitches would be enough, especially around the face. &quot;God, he did a number on your face as well.&quot; He stared feeling around the boy&#39;s cheeks, causing mild discomfort. Not only did the touch hurt, but it also felt physically revolting: Seeing Cherokee Bill &quot;&quot;care&quot;&quot; about his Master&#39;s condition felt utterly wrong. Even Lachlan felt off.

&quot;No wonder you wanted him dead. How the fuck are you still alive?! This looks awful!&quot; One couldn&#39;t tell if Bill was pissed at Adler, Lachlan or himself.

A long, ugly scar revealed itself, stretching all the way down the side of his neck.

The scar had stopped bleeding, due to the extra care he had taken while administering the healing spells. Though it still looked quite raw and disfigured, with bumps and wrinkles in places where natural human skin would have been completely smooth.

Noticing Bill&#39;s eyes on his face, Lachlan grabbed Bill&#39;s wrists, nails digging deep into skin and gaze averted to look at anything but his Servant. HIs eyes went wide with horror — but a second later he brought it under control. Torn between the urge to shrink away, to snarl, and to rip out his Servant&#39;s eyes. Indecision and sudden panic ate up his words.

<em>&lt;...Don&#39;t look. Everything&#39;s fine.&gt;</em>

<em>Don&#39;t dwell on it. Don&#39;t dwell on it...</em>

Heart pounded in his chest, though it wasn&#39;t all due to the blood loss. He summoned more strength into his trembling fingers and attempted to pry Bill&#39;s hands away from his collar.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not only was his face horrid, but the boy&#39;s attitude towards it gave him chills. He didn&#39;t whine, moan or cry about it like the gang members who called him &#39;momma&#39;. He didn&#39;t care about the pain, he cared more about Bill being a witness to the imperfections on the boy&#39;s skin. The scars that ran far beyond what he could even imagine.

&quot;Fine? You call <em>this</em> fine, you stupid fuck?!&quot; Bill spat back. &quot;I&#39;m not having a fucking leper as a Master, I&#39;ll tell you that. Now, how do I fix this? There should be some voodoo crap you can do to-&quot;

Despite his vicious attitude, one could tell that Bill&#39;s actions meant &#39;well&#39;. Lachlan, however, had other plans, digging his nails into Bill&#39;s wrists and trying his best to drag them away. An impossible effort, due to his nature as a human and a half-dead one at that. The act itself, however, was tremendous.

After all, could Bill really keep a straight face in front of Lachlan&#39;s unnerving gaze? Those eyes told him everything: They were palpitating, blood pressure rising as painful memories flooded back into the boy&#39;s head. He didn&#39;t need to know the details to realize that the face&#39;s injuries were far more than just a blemish on his Master&#39;s skin.

Reluctantly, Bill lowered his hands, giving them some breathing room. He wanted to know more, but was afraid that his Master would die from a stress induced heart attack at this rate. He slowly rose back up, leaving the car and standing outside as he took in the night air.

&quot;You gonna tell me what&#39;s up with that ugly ass mug of yours, or do I need to take out my gun again?&quot; He threatened, calmly. His throat itched. He could go for a cigarette. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

And just when had begun to feel nostalgic. The same old tactics, a bullet that could end his life in one shot. The first time Bill had threatened him with it, it had worked wonders, so why bother changing his strategy now?

Lachlan was no stranger to threats; he had been listening to them all night, from the Adler senior, from Lancer, from Bill. But hearing them spoken aloud each and every time still sent a shiver down his spine. The objective. Focus on the objective, he urged himself. No comebacks. No thoughts. Shut it all down. Only survival. 

He leaned back against the car, hand pressed against the window frame, and fumbled for the door handle. 

<em>&lt;It&#39;s a long story,&gt;</em> he hesitated. <em>&lt;Complicated. And before you start jumping to conclusions, I should warn you that I don&#39;t come out of it very well.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Despite his probing, the boy seemed insistent on keeping their secrets. To say that this annoyed him would be putting it lightly, considering how much of his problems had been caused by Lachlan doing whatever he wanted and keeping Bill in the dark. His fingers itched for the gun, until the Dowling heir conveyed one last thought: The reason for their secrecy was simply because it was uncomfortable.

Somehow, Bill found that a far more justifiable excuse than anything else. Almost as if he&#39;d have said the same in Lachlan&#39;s position. A gun wouldn&#39;t have accomplished anything.

&quot;I&#39;m not gonna judge you, kid. I got plenty of reasons to hate you already.&quot; Bill said with a tired smile. &quot;And frankly, I&#39;m not here to be your nagging wife. But if you let those secrets of yours hold me back, then you might as well stick this gun of mine in your mouth already.&quot;

A blunt statement, but a truthful one. Bill couldn&#39;t see himself ever working at 100% efficiency if his boss didn&#39;t fully trust him. What sort of gun could fire if its owner didn&#39;t have faith in its ability? To use a weapon that you held no respect for was insulting, both to the weapon and the gunman themselves.

Bill leaned on the car door, observing how Lachlan had shut himself off like a cornered rat. He wondered what sort of bait would work to pry the mouse out of their cage.

&quot;What? Do I look like a fucking skinwalker or something?&quot; He poked fun at his Master&#39;s behavior.  <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a supposed one-trick gun, Bill had an absurd number of demands. A firearm with a mind of its own? It presented a threat, a liability, prone to unpredictable misfires. Rather than a reliable weapon, his Servant felt more like a noose wrapped around his neck.

After a brief search, Lachlan finally located the car door handle and pulled on it, causing the door to budge. A slight movement came from inside the car, then a bloody claw knocked against the window, pushing the door open the rest of the way. The Dancer sat hunched on the other side of the backseat, one of its arms extended fully as it lent its assistance to the task at hand.

<em>&lt;Get a few more wounds like that, and I might just mistake you for one.&gt;</em> Lachlan&#39;s eyes briefly lingered on the hole in Bill&#39;s shoulder. Then he invited himself to the backseat, making himself comfortable on the edge.

&quot;No thanks. A bit packed for my tastes.&quot; Bill gave the Dancer a nasty glare while tolerating more of Lachlan&#39;s insults at his condition.

&quot;Wounds that you caused, by the way. Unless you wanted to get bit by that geezer&#39;s mutt.&quot; He scoffed. &quot;Mommy and daddy ought to be so proud. Raised a good kid.&quot; He kept the insults flying. He couldn&#39;t help it, since he felt a need to destress. He had always thought that he&#39;d be terrible with kids.

Fucking. Hard.&gt;</em>

Cautiously, he pressed against his wound, gingerly feeling around the skin for signs of fresh bleeding. Then, slowly, he tilted his head, and fixed his gray eyes upon the Archer. 

<em>&lt;Ever experienced the thrill of having your beloved twin brother make a desperate attempt on your life, all neatly packaged as a bloody <strong>accident</strong>? It&#39;s the kind of thing that really does wonders for your faith...in just about anything, don&#39;t you think?&gt;</em>

The smile dissolved from his face like sugar cubes in hot tea, replaced by a fleeting moment of uncertainty. He hesitated, fingers teasing the buttons of his shirt. Should he dare?

<em>&lt;We were eleven,&gt;</em> he said finally. <em>&lt;Out hunting together, our loyal Skinwalkers by our side. It was meant to be a celebration before I inherited the Family Crest...then everything spiraled. My Dancer, my own partner, went <strong>berserk</strong>.&gt;</em>

His fingers glided through the buttons, meticulously undoing each one.

<em>&lt;The next thing I remember, I woke up in a hospital bed, stripped of everything I was destined for. The Crest. The inheritance. Eight months had passed. My brother took it all while I lay helpless in a coma. And what did I get in return?&gt;</em>

The shirt fell away, revealing skin as smooth as porcelain...or so the Archer had thought. Instead he was greeted by a patchwork of scars and mottled tones, held together by invisible stitches that mirrored his Master&#39;s handiwork on the puppets.

Four long scars stood out in particular, running diagonally across his torso from the collarbone down to his right waist. They were raised and shiny with scar tissue, the size and shape strangely reminiscent of the gashes the Dancer had inflicted upon the zombies.

But now, what purpose would he serve by revealing them to Bill, aside from satiating the brute&#39;s mindless curiosity? Nothing but humiliation. A net loss.

<em>&lt;The Dancer was conditioned to be my personal bodyguard,&gt;</em> he explained mechanically, choosing to focus on the technicalities so he could distance himself from the memories. <em>&lt;Devoted to protect me at all costs.

It wasn&#39;t out of a sense of loyalty, but just a self-imposed rule that he had placed on himself. What made people tick? What made them want to wake up to see the next morning? He was always curious about such matters, be it with Bill Cook or the spoiled Dowling heir.

As Lachlan kept explaining his past, carefully pacing himself with each point as he unbuttoned himself, Bill couldn&#39;t help but frown: With each layer of clothing gone, he started seeing more and more scars. Ones that could not heal, both on the skin and in the mind. The type of injuries that would have made any member of the Cook gang quit. Yes, even Bill Cook himself.

He realized now how much of a gang of pansies he had coddled, compared to how utterly unspoilt Lachlan was. He was a Dowling heir, but that seemed like more of a prison than a throne. The cowboy patiently listened, noticing the details about Lachlan&#39;s brother, the puppet Magecraft that led to the disgusting Dancer, and then-

&quot;The mice danced while the cat was asleep. Nice.&quot; Bill chuckled, with a hint of sarcasm. This was no laughing matter, yet he couldn&#39;t help it. What else could he say in the face of Lachlan&#39;s injuries? Not even Lachlan himself wanted to dwell on it, going back to a lecture on his Magecraft and how it functioned. Bill saw it as yet another chance to flex his superior knowledge, until he realized the bread trail that his Master was forming.

&quot;So, you thought it was them? That your own blood betrayed you?&quot; Bill gave off a crooked smile. &quot;Figures. Who wouldn&#39;t, with the way you act?&quot; He spoke back, testing the waters with his boldness. He didn&#39;t know if Lachlan expected pity or compassion, but Bill would give him neither. He wasn&#39;t here to coddle him, after all. Understanding one another didn&#39;t mean licking each others&#39; wounds.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349151046225980 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349151046225980><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:31 PM">6:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror or listened to your own voice? Because with the way you act, I&#39;d shoot you in the back myself.&quot; Bill snarked. &quot;Look at me in the eye and say it. Say that you were a good brother. Shit, I can&#39;t even say it myself. It&#39;s just <em>that</em> obvious of a lie.&quot;

He giggled, his inhuman gurgling sounding like the cross of a rooster with a hyena. Lachlan&#39;s story wasn&#39;t even that funny. What was funny was the way Lachlan viewed the world because of it. That a great tragedy had struck him in the back. That he was completely undeserving of what had transpired so many years ago.

He was right.

But Bill would still rub it in. How could he not, when he had suffered as well? To see some brat claim that their life was suffering caused him to want to strike back.

&quot;You got stabbed in the back because he hated your guts, I bet. I bet your pet hates your guts even more.&quot; Bill pointed to the Dancer. &quot;It&#39;s still alive, isn&#39;t it? What do you think would happen if you let it loose? Would it be happy, or would it gut your ass like a fish fillet?&quot; Howling followed. A minute later, it stopped, with Bill adjusting his hat and regaining his composure.

&quot;Well, whatever. I&#39;d be pissed off too if that happened to me. But I know for a fact that I&#39;m a bad person. They call me an outlaw. I was hanged, even.&quot; Archer giggled. &quot;I had no room to die as a saint. Couldn&#39;t see myself living as one either, nope.&quot; He laughed.

&quot;I chose this path.&quot; He said with a confident smile, almost proud. As if to flash superiority in comparison to Lachlan&#39;s pity party.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349201797283841 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349201797283841><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:31 PM">6:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But did he? Did he really choose the life of an outlaw? What made him pick up the gun and enact vengeance? What made him pursue the life of blood and money?

He knew the answer, but refused to acknowledge it. He was being so hard on his Master and poking in all the right directions, because he knew which areas hurt. After all, how hard could it be to <strong>hurt someone just like him?</strong>

They were more alike than he&#39;d like to admit.

&quot;You can read it in the books if you want.&quot; Bill laughed, referring to his own fame. &quot;I picked up the gun because I wanted to. I <strong>chose</strong> to be bad. Are you telling me you&#39;re a total asshat because of your upbringing? Because I don&#39;t buy it, not one bit. You&#39;re no saint.&quot;

His lips curled into a snarl.

He sat on his seat, clenching and unclenching the Dancer&#39;s claws as he listened. The Dancer did not flinch. It sat docile in the corner of the car, hands resting in Lachlan&#39;s lap and allowing the young master to toy with them as he pleased. Whether it was scratches, pinches, or any other actions inflicted upon its flesh, the puppet showed no reaction, and simply lay dormant like a house-trained pet.

<em>&lt;So what if he hates my guts?&gt;</em> He rebuked Bill&#39;s words. <em>&lt;What if they all hate my guts?&gt;</em> 

He reached for the gun resting under his coat. Tapped it against the Dancer&#39;s hand, then proceeded to pull back the hammer, loading a bullet and aligning his finger with the trigger.

<em>&lt;Will compassion get me this far?&gt;</em> He taunted the Archer.

The Dancer did not so much as stir.

<em>&lt;Or this far?&gt;</em> With a flick of his wrist, Lachlan pointed the gun towards the Dancer&#39;s face. The puppet obligingly opened its maw, wrapping its tongue around the muzzle of the gun. If the young master wished to fire, then the Dancer would surely assist, pushing the trigger that would jeopardize its own well-being.

<em>&lt;Show people compassion, and all that remains is the looming possibility of betrayal.&gt;</em> Lachlan let go of his gun, allowing the Dancer to stow it away. He locked eyes with Bill, and as the Archer&#39;s judgment seeped through, something like unease settled on his features.

Then it was gone. Like always, wiped clean of the practiced mask that was his face. Years ahead, the Dowling heir would no doubt become a seasoned actor, impervious to anything that threatened to expose his true emotions. But for now, he remained young and malleable, yet to be molded by the world.

Or perhaps the world had already molded him. Lachlan clutched his shirt, drawing them closer as if erecting a barricade around himself.

Bill&#39;s accusations hit harder than they should have. What did he know, and how could he possibly understand? His twin did not die a martyr&#39;s death. Roland had not always been an innocent lapdog either. No free man would willingly collaborate with the devil. There had to be hidden motives, making them both tainted. But what did Bill truly know of the memories that Lachlan possessed? How could he comprehend the choices forced upon him?

Bill was just an outlaw, living a carefree life without obligations. In that, they could not be any more different, and yet, the Archer was right in a crooked way.

<em>&lt;I did choose this path,&gt;</em> he responded with a smile. <em>&lt;Roland took his life, and I took his face. That decision was mine alone. But I did not choose to get along with the likes of you.&gt;</em>

He pointed at the Archer, palm facing up. <em>&lt;You have to <strong>earn</strong> it. As I said before, camaraderie can be easily faked. I&#39;d work with you, hell, I&#39;d even work <strong>for</strong> you if our interests align. But do they truly align?&gt;</em>

He tapped his finger on his knee. <em>&lt;Your reason for being here,&gt;</em> he said. <em>&lt;With so little to your name, I find it hard to believe that you are here solely out of the goodness of your heart, to help me acquire the Holy Grail.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This was the essence of a true Dowling, one completely devoid of trust that was not earned. People were nothing more than marionettes without strings, Cherokee Bill included. The fact that Lachlan had chosen to display his power in such an overpowering manner was enough of an answer to Bill.

He had never thought he&#39;d be working alongside someone so manipulative, yet so fragile all the same. The need for complete control was a heavy burden to bear, something that Bill wasn&#39;t exactly keen on.

&quot;Dogs sleep, but they aren&#39;t dead yet.&quot; Archer laughed at Lachlan&#39;s description of control. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d feel safe around a pack of rabid dogs, but you do you.&quot; He joked, clearly referring to Dancer. He received some more probing and judging from Lachlan as a reward for his sharp tongue.

&quot;I&#39;m greedy.&quot; Bill delivered a simple reply. &quot;I see something that I could get, and I choose to get it. Anything wrong with that?&quot; He asked back, wondering if Lachlan was satisfied.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349367380037752 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349367380037752><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:31 PM">6:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;If the Grail can truly achieve anything that I want, then of course I&#39;d want it. Are you saying I need a reason to chase after it?&quot; He laughed. How silly of a question. Would an outlaw say no to a prize? Of course not! It was in Bill&#39;s nature to pillage, pilfer and steal anything that was within reach. To live today as if there was no tomorrow and enjoy everything the world had to offer.

...A lie, of course. A lie that even affected himself. Deep down, there was something Bill wanted, something that he wished to receive closure to. But these thoughts were locked up far, far away into the corners of his mind. They served no purpose to an outlaw, besides being a momentary source of strength. Not like he&#39;d ever reveal them to Lachlan, of course.

&quot;I guess the question is: Do you have any issues with me getting the Grail? Hmmm?&quot; Bill scratched the end of his chin. &quot;Once bitten, twice shy, is it? I guess betrayal runs deep.&quot; He joked, playing around with his gun as he said that. He made sure Lachlan could see it closely, trying to tease his suspicions of a possible betrayal.

&quot;Afraid of my gun, maybe? Is that what this is all about?&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If Bill&#39;s desire for the Grail was solely driven by its accessibility, if his motivation could change so effortlessly, then it would be just as effortless for him to suddenly lose interest in it. And that—

<em>&lt;—is the issue with you outlaws. Flippant, fickle to a fault.&gt;</em> Lachlan shook his head. <em>&lt;What if a bigger fish presented itself? Who&#39;s to say that you won&#39;t abandon your original plan and chase after the new one instead?&gt;</em>

A fair assessment, because he, Lachlan James Dowling, could not afford to lose sight of his prize. It wasn&#39;t just a matter of pride, but...

<em>&lt;I need to win,&gt;</em> He stated simply. <em>&lt;Even if it means stepping on a few lives along the way. All the riches in the world can&#39;t deter me from that. But once we get there, the Grail is yours. I have no interest in it, so you can put that away.&gt;</em>

He didn&#39;t mince words, revealing his true thoughts on how he viewed people like Bill. Those with no strings attached to obey to his every command.

&quot;Like I said, you gotta keep things interesting.&quot; Bill laughed, referring to their first encounter at the lake. He had promised Lachlan servitude...so long as their relationship kept things fresh. &quot;So, don&#39;t overthink it, and just keep doing you. If I ever get bored, you&#39;ll know. Heheh.&quot;

So far, he couldn&#39;t tell whether he felt disappointed or not. If there&#39;s one thing he could credit Lachlan for, it was that he was a very unique brand of Master. Most interesting was the fact that the boy was willing to give away the Grail.

&quot;A matter of pride, then.&quot; Bill said, as if repeating it to himself, before breaking down into a chuckle. &quot;Hah. So silly. I wouldn&#39;t have expected that.&quot; He added, holstering his gun after Lachlan kept glaring at it.

&quot;You know that pride is worth nothing, right? Money is. Power is. The Grail is. But pride? Who are you trying to impress? You&#39;ve got everything and everyone wrapped around your fingers already, no? All those puppets around your strings.&quot; He articulated by raising his fingers, having them wiggle in the air as he waved them in front of the car door, taunting Lachlan.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349529825427506 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349529825427506><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:32 PM">6:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t feel proud if you ordered a bunch of puppets to suck you off now, right? If trust is earned, then <strong>who&#39;s trust are you trying to earn back from.&quot;</strong>

His face leaned eerily close, poking his neck through the car window as he was now just a short distance away from Lachlan&#39;s chest.

&quot;Can&#39;t be your brother - The boy&#39;s dead. Can&#39;t be that wimp of your assistant. Maybe...&quot;

Bill&#39;s hat tumbled to the ground. The Dancer perked up its head. The young master, picking a fight? 

<em>&lt;I do this for no one,&gt;</em> Lachlan growled. His hand throbbed where it had struck bone, but Bill didn&#39;t even flinch. He might as well have struck stone.

<em>&lt;No one but myself. My father has no part in this, he...&gt;</em>

Cold steak. Acrid wine. Pale eyes staring across the table, indifferent and inured. So what if he died? A terrible loss, surely, but one that was replaceable with another decade of child rearing. A well-treated prisoner he was, but a son, he was not.

And so he fled. Journeying halfway across the globe. But freedom eluded him still.

Bill remained shook, his hat flying off for the first time in years. Messy and unkempt black hair trickled down from his forehead, covering his lost gaze as his focus disappeared. The spell lasted a second, before he recomposed himself and stared ahead. Lachlan&#39;s eyes had changed, grey as soot, with all the flames that came with. A deep resentment lurked beneath those weathered orbs, the kind that were inflicted on him by his own guardians. Something Bill could never understand.

Or could he?

&quot;...So I was right on the money.&quot; Bill said, almost as if trying to gain some leverage by restating that his words were correct. It was easy to appear confident if you knew that you were in the right. Perhaps due to the subject matter, however, he did not gloat nor affirm his superiority. Instead, he lowered himself and grabbed his hat, adjusting it around his head.

After all, his hat was none other than a modified accessory. A bastardization of the hats that Buffalo Soldiers wore back in the day, with the darkest hues of blacks to look even more menacing. Bill had specifically requested it at the store in question.

After all, his father was a Buffalo Soldier in the first place. A man of high status and importance, at least that&#39;s what his mom always told him. He carried those thoughts with him to the grave, no matter how wicked of an outlaw he was. No matter his feelings towards his father.

To see Lachlan harbor so much hatred towards a father figure filled Bill with confusion. How could you ever hate someone who was your own flesh and blood? Someone who participated in your conception? You&#39;d be no different than a mutt biting its owner&#39;s hand. Bill could never hate his dad.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349713393328258 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349713393328258><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:33 PM">6:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
...In public, at least. But deep down, when his mother wasn&#39;t looking, when he was alone as a child, or hell, even when he was away from Bill Cook and doing his own thing...

He hated that man&#39;s guts. He absolutely did. What did it mean to be good, noble and mighty if you left behind those that cared about you the most? That was far more vile than stealing, pillaging and looting the entire West. He had stolen his family&#39;s heart and gotten away with it.

Archer couldn&#39;t be any more different from the spoiled Dowling brat. Then why did his heart ache when he saw Lachlan&#39;s same disgust directed towards his own father?

&quot;You got daddy issues. What a surprise. Guess the little prince isn&#39;t so blessed after all.&quot; Bill said, but he couldn&#39;t smile. Not even he was capable of joking around with his current feelings. &quot;But if he&#39;s scum, then why care? You don&#39;t need his love. You don&#39;t need to be his <em>pride.</em>&quot;

He got closer, leaning on the open car door.

&quot;I&#39;d never be the man that I am now if I kept chasing after that old bastard of mine. Look where I am now: You can find books of me everywhere. I&#39;ll be here when you&#39;re nothing but bones.&quot; Bill said in a way that was both a boast and a statement.

&quot;But it don&#39;t have to be this way. Why not follow my lead and leave that pride of yours behind? He may be your father, but he ain&#39;t your daddy.&quot; He extended an arm, tempting his Master. &quot;There is no need for pride once you have the Grail. C&#39;mon boy. Shake this poor sinner&#39;s hand.&quot;

It hung there like an olive branch, but what did that mean to him? He didn&#39;t need acts of generosity. He didn&#39;t need a lifeline he wasn&#39;t ready to grasp. But above all, he utterly <em>despised</em> these gestures. Even if he didn&#39;t pity himself, it was always gestures like this that made him feel downright miserable. 

<em>Treat me as an equal, you bastard!</em>

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t you dare look at me like you&#39;ve got it all figured out,&gt;</em> he seethed. &#39;I told you, I&#39;m not doing any of this for him. <strong>He means nothing to me,</strong>&#39; he spat out the words, his voice merging with the telepathic message in Bill&#39;s mind. <strong>&#39;Absolutely NOTHING!&#39;</strong>

<em>That&#39;s right...nothing.</em>

But before he realized it, his own hand had clasped itself around Bill&#39;s wrist, in search of a connection that should not exist. The irony wasn&#39;t lost on him — that Cherokee Bill, of all people, would validate his deep-seated resentment towards the man who held the biological responsibility for his existence. 

Was the idea of mutual understanding even conceivable? The mere possibility filled him with warmth, only to be extinguished as a chilling realization drenched him from head to toe.

<em>No...he&#39;s just trying to get to you. Trying to get in your head.</em>

Instinctively and mechanically, his brain picked out those words, key phrases that had slipped from Bill&#39;s mouth. <em>Follow my lead,</em> the Archer had said. It all boiled down to this, a perpetual game of tug-of-war. Lachlan recognized those tactics all too well: the art of tearing people down, only to lift them up at the last moment, thereby fostering an unhealthy dependence...

It was one of the first lessons he had been taught. Had he allowed himself to let down his guard?

It had felt good, the sensation of holding something firmly in his grasp, without the need to force it into his possession. The illusion of brothers in arms. It had felt good while it lasted.

<em>Make them depend on you.</em>

Lachlan looked up at Bill. <em>&lt;That&#39;s as good a handshake as any,&gt;</em> he said defensively. <em>&lt;Seriously though, there&#39;s no need to shake on anything. We&#39;re not kids anymore.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The boy prodded at Bill&#39;s arm, as if attempting to swat him away, but to no avail. Instead, Lachlan&#39;s fingers reluctantly wrapped around Bill&#39;s wrist, clung on him like a dog to tasty bones.

&quot;I&#39;m trying to <em>make you</em> an equal, dumbass.&quot; Bill sneered, though his laughter sooned stopped once he felt his Master&#39;s mind fracture. He was correct, for better or worse. The relationship between Lachlan and his father was most likely strained and vicious, something that he could barely grasp the surface of.

<em><strong>&quot;He is nothing to me!&quot;</strong></em>

A classic phrase. One that felt like an echo. To Bill, it sounded eerily familiar, to the point it pissed him off.

&quot;If he&#39;s nothing to you, then same here.&quot; Bill gripped at Lachlan&#39;s wrist. &quot;I don&#39;t give a damn about your dad, but if you really want to leave his shadow, then why the <em>fuck</em> are you against me? I&#39;m your golden ticket out of here.&quot;

Bill was a gun. He was meant to be fired, but that also meant that he was powerless with no owner. Lachlan was the closest person who could fill that role, if only he were brave enough to grab the pistol and escape his father&#39;s influence.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110349827776184360 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110349827776184360><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:33 PM">6:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But the voices eventually won out, causing Lachlan to release his grip as he recomposed himself with the usual cold and distant glare. That&#39;s when Bill realized that the boy had been trained far too well.

&quot;Not a kid? You certainly acted like one.&quot; Archer joked, but with a tinge of unease. He wasn&#39;t a people&#39;s person, but even he could tell that enough damage had been done to Lachlan&#39;s psyche. Everyone was either beneath him or a potential threat. The word &#39;ally&#39; never crossed his mind. Whatever training the boy had endured had massively shaped his worldview, perhaps even permanently.

Could a bullet really pierce through the darkness? If anything, the window of opportunity had passed, like the flash of gunfire.

&quot;A handshake means we agree on something. I can&#39;t say we do, though.&quot; Bill replied, tilting his hat. &quot;I don&#39;t really care for prying into your daddy issues, but you do realize that your pride is holding us back, right? All we need is the Grail. You can think about what to tell to your dad after that.&quot; He proposed, as if setting new terms for the contract.

&quot;Are we clear? If you wanna be equals, you could at least agree to things instead of doing them your own way.&quot; He spat. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was confused by Bill&#39;s demeanor. He didn&#39;t necessarily disagree with Bill, but why did he sound dissatisfied, as if Lachlan hadn&#39;t met his expectations? What game was Bill playing? 

And what was all this talk about pride? He had lost that long ago, from the moment he&#39;d been cast aside like a mere pawn. He had made up his mind back then, hadn&#39;t he? Perhaps Bill was just trying to provoke him, see if he&#39;d crack under the pressure?

&lt;I&#39;m not afraid of getting my hands dirty, if that&#39;s what concerns you. You&#39;ve seen my work plenty of times already,&gt; he asserted. &lt;Of course, I can make an effort to be more transparent about my intentions.  I&#39;ll also pay closer attention to your input. Looking back, it was an oversight to treat you the same as Roland...the fault...it lies with me.&gt;

Admitting that was no easy task, especially when he had to convince himself to genuinely <em>mean it</em>. Bill had shown to have a rather keen sense for spotting insincerity.

&lt;We can make a fresh start,&gt; he stared at his own hand, thought hard, then tentatively held it out towards Bill again. He had once had someone whom he could call a brother. Surely he could recall what it felt like to work <em>with</em> someone, if he willed it? If nothing else, it should at least make his actions more believable, no?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

All that remained was a slight grumbling, as he felt every ounce of tension in the brat&#39;s voice, followed by the muddied thoughts that were indecisive and lacking conviction. Part of Lachlan really wanted to collaborate with his own Servant. It would have been incredibly easy too, due to how mutually beneficial their relationship could be. Despite that, some habits were simply impossible to unlearn. The entirety of Lachlan&#39;s life experience was crashing down on him, warning him of potential red flags that Bill exhibited.

Bill couldn&#39;t sense all that, of course, but he could still feel the unease in his Master. It finally defused as the boy took the first approach, extending his arm for a handshake. 

&quot;No issue at all, boss. Just let me get back to work!&quot; Bill said with a smile, slapping down hard on Lachlan&#39;s hand and giving him a tight and firm handshake. The boy&#39;s fingers were practically being squeezed.

&quot;No need to worry about the past. I&#39;m more of a forgive and forget type of guy, if you believe that. Heheheh.&quot; He laughed, looking down on Lachlan with a wide grin that was barely noticeable through the depth of his mask. It was the &#39;nicest&#39; Bill had been to him in a while, as if he was trying to look trustworthy once again. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill was physically superior, that he was well aware of, having experienced it firsthand on multiple occasions. But he couldn&#39;t just back down from a simple handshake.

Let bygones be bygones, eh? He chewed on those words. Bill had uttered them so effortlessly, but Lachlan couldn&#39;t bring himself to believe a single word. How could anyone? If they were hurt, the pain remained a void, waiting to be filled. There was no easy reconciliation unless one resorted to lies. There was only ever one way to truly start anew...

&lt;I&#39;m the type who prefers settling debts and balancing the books, rather than to forgive and forget,&gt; he confessed to Bill. &lt;Since we&#39;re being honest with each other, I won&#39;t hold back either. There&#39;s something I have to do before I can move on.&gt;

He steadied his breath. The back of his neck prickled. Then he spoke, his voice raw and cracked from the toll of his injuries.

<strong>&#39;I order you with my Command Spell, Cherokee Bill. Break your fingers.&#39;</strong>

Nonetheless, the ritual had been completed. A faint red glow silhouetted the puppeteer&#39;s hair as a surge of mana, more dense and potent than anything BIll had experienced, suffused his being.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill was willing to stick it out with his Master a while longer, especially if they had come to a mutual understanding. Judging by Lachlan&#39;s trembling and lack of refinement, the boy was legitimately pondering Bill&#39;s words. A good sign, no doubt! No more lies or deceit among the two. Just an actual Master-Servant pair for once with a common goal.

At least, that&#39;s what he was led to believe, until Lachlan forwarded him another message.

&quot;Debts? What, I spent too much of your slave&#39;s budget or something?&quot; Bill mentioned Roland, unaware of what his Master truly meant. It wasn&#39;t until the Command Spell flashed that Archer realized what exactly was going on. He freaked out, body trembling as his arms moved with a will of their own. His knees stumbled and he lost balance, falling to the ground as his dominant hand was already lunging for his left, grabbing his index finger tightly until-

<em>CRACK!</em>

<em><strong>&quot;MOTHERFUCKER!&quot;</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350063118585917 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350063118585917><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:34 PM">6:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill howls were louder than those of a dying lion. Proud and boisterous, yet pathetic all the same as the Servant was left grovelling outside the car with his Master being able to fully experience the miserable sight from a safe distance. Lachlan could consider it primetime entertainment, watching the Archer whimper and moan with each finger crack, counting down the number of snaps like candles on a birthday cake.

Now, the bad thing about fingers was that there were only ten of them. Not enough to last an entire show. Perhaps Lachlan should have included toes, but his Command Spell was unfortunately already spent. It didn&#39;t matter though, since the second act of the show was about to start: How would Bill react?

<em>&quot;I&#39;ll kill you. I&#39;ll kill you, kill you! Not even the maggots will feast on your corpse!&quot;</em> Bill&#39;s mouth was bloodied, being forced to use his mouth in order to make the finger breaking &#39;easier&#39;. He spat out his own blood, staring at his own reflection in a nearby rainy puddle as he plotted out his revenge. Breaking Lachlan&#39;s fingers one by one. Forcing the boy to eat their own nails. Anything but an easy death.

&quot;YAAAAARGH!&quot; Bill screamed, regaining control of his body as he stood up and marched back to Lachlan. He was filled with strong emotions: Hatred, rage, revenge. Anything to make up for the powerlessness he felt in that instant. That was the whole reason he had become an outlaw in the first place, to never feel that again. Lachlan had stolen that safety from him, which made him his enemy, regardless of him being his Master. The cowboy was ready to stick to his laws, inching closer to his target...

...But in reality, he felt conflicted. As horrible as Lachlan was, the shaking from before was genuine. The uneasiness as well. Those behaviours didn&#39;t make sense to Bill at first, until he tried imagining himself in the brat&#39;s position. If he were Lachlan-</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350112904986775 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350112904986775><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:34 PM">6:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
-He&#39;d be shitting his pants.

There was a reason Bill always wanted to be an enforcer. It wasn&#39;t like other members of the gang couldn&#39;t do the job, they could always hire more after all. But Bill was quick to dissuade them, always telling them that it was cheaper to rely on the almighty Cherokee Bill instead. Guns were meant to be used, after all, not to be kept as display trophies. That&#39;s how Bill viewed his life: To not only be of constant use, but to be the &#39;special&#39; one of the bunch. One nobody could replace.

That&#39;s why Lachlan couldn&#39;t trust him. Bill&#39;s presence alone was a threat. He was strong, fast, and worst of all, a wild card. Completely outside of his Master&#39;s sphere of influence, being neither a puppet nor a family relative. The moment Lachlan had realized that Bill was nowhere near as spineless as Roland was the moment Lachlan too had started viewing him as an enemy.

No wonder Bill reacted the same way. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, with the two propping up the other as someone to defeat. He wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they cannibalized each other if they kept it up.

Which is why he needed to stop, as the &#39;mature&#39; one of the two. Or at least, he knew that he&#39;d look more mature if he didn&#39;t take the brat&#39;s bait. What a pain in the ass that kid was.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350159612739734 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350159612739734><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:35 PM">6:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>THUMP!</em>

Bill kicked Lachlan&#39;s car in a fit, causing a small dent on it as he leaned into the open door with a bloodied scowl. &quot;You call this settled, then? <em>Huh?!?&quot;</em> He shouted in loud growls. &quot;I hope that felt good, kid. Savor it, &#39;cause I don&#39;t know what the <em>hell</em> I&#39;ll do to you if you pull this again.&quot;

He then threw a coughing fit, spitting out blood into the car. If Lachlan looked closely he would notice that pieces of Bill&#39;s fingers were caught in the blood, no doubt the result of the outlaw biting them off.

&quot;There&#39;s been a lot of lies said tonight, but <em>THAT</em> you can believe.&quot; He shouted, delivering his ultimatum. He was loud, abrasive and downright unpleasant to talk to, but the fact that he hadn&#39;t immediately tried to kill Lachlan after the broken fingers already showed the amount of restraint Bill had in that moment.

&quot;Now then,&quot; The cowboy took a seat, making sure to avoid the blood that he had just puked. &quot;if you can heal yourself, then you can heal me after. I&#39;m gonna nap. We&#39;re even.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead of exhilaration, a wave of exhaustion washed over him, sapping his body of strength. Lachlan slumped against his seat. It felt as if he had completed some monumental task: the sheer relief from a job well done had eclipsed any sadistic pleasure he might have derived from watching his Servant squirm.

Meanwhile, any trace of joviality that might have lingered in Bill had all but vanished, replaced by an overwhelming surge of hostility. He screamed obscenities in Lachlan&#39;s face, fangs bared and eyes ablaze with anger, resembling a rabid dog. The once pleasant atmosphere they had so gingerly cultivated was gone at once. For a split second, Lachlan wondered whether he had made the right call. Bill seemed more agreeable before, back when his mood wasn&#39;t so sour.

Half-expecting his Servant to retaliate, Lachlan braced himself. But to his surprise, and perhaps bewilderment, the Archer held himself back, as if restrained by an invisible leach. 

Lachlan was taken aback. Bill had been provoked for far less in the past. Had the Command Seal managed to instill a genuine fear in him? It was hard to tell from his erratic behavior, but whatever the reason, it seemed that he had found Bill&#39;s limit.

Strangely, a sense of comfort greeted him after this realization. Though it would seem that he and Bill had reached a new low in their relationship, it was here, at rock bottom, that he felt the most secure. It was as if he had stumbled upon a hidden safe room just before reaching Bill&#39;s breaking point, or at least that was what he had believed. If Bill was still willing to work with him after allowing him to &#39;settle the past score&#39;, then perhaps there was credibility to his words yet.

The flesh, the blood...everything would turn into spiritrons soon enough, leaving no trace behind. Bill, however, would remain alive and in the flesh, and no matter how he convinced himself that this hound would no longer bite, his heart still palpitated with nervous energy as he confronted his Servant.

It had been far easier to face Bill when his emotions were fueled by blind rage; it seemed that he, too, responded to fear with anger.

But unfortunately for the Dowling heir, he couldn&#39;t summon any of that anger right now. Tension had completely drained out of his body the moment his Command Seal had been invoked, leaving nothing but fatigue behind.

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t double-cross me. Never aim a weapon at me. And please, let&#39;s not waste another Command Spell again...these things don&#39;t come cheap, you know?&gt;</em> He leaned his head back and stared at the ceiling of the car.

<em>&lt;Keep those principles in mind, and I&#39;ll lend a ear to whatever you have to say. We can work together,&gt;</em> he hesitated slightly.

He was sure Lachlan would be fine, since the boy was confident enough to suture himself if needed. But thoughts still kept rumbling in his head, coming from his Master who wasn&#39;t as satisfied from Bill&#39;s pain as they had thought. However, they did seem more comfortable, comfortable enough to start barking orders again.

&quot;Shut the hell up and lemme sleep in peace.&quot; Bill said strong words with a quiet mouth, clearly refraining from giving in to his impulses. &quot;I already gave you my word: We&#39;re even. You ever read stories of me shooting Bill Cook in the back? Nope? Thought so.&quot;

He puffed out hot air, as if wondering how someone as well-prepared and intelligent as Lachlan could look so insecure when it came to the little things. No outlaw worth their salt would be scared of their own gun, after all. But in Lachlan&#39;s eyes, Bill was not a gun, but a hungry wolf needing to be fed. If they planned on making any headway in their working relationship, then he needed to erase that reference in the boy&#39;s mind.

It wasn&#39;t like he <em>needed</em> to do that. He owed Lachlan nothing, considering their already sour relationship and how he couldn&#39;t stand having such a prick of a Master. Yet, despite his best attempts to detach himself from the kid&#39;s troubles, he couldn&#39;t help but see a glimmer of kinship in his Master&#39;s eyes. 

Perhaps that was why he had been summoned. To be forced to take a close, long look at a mirror.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350293339738226 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350293339738226><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:35 PM">6:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I made up my mind ten minutes ago. I don&#39;t need to repeat myself.&quot; Bill said, turning his head to his Master. &quot;I&#39;m already your gun. You think guns can betray you?&quot; He laughed, before patting Lachlan on the shoulder, with no fingers of course. Blood splattered on the boy&#39;s suit, a harsh reminder of the punishment Bill had endured, but also a message from the cowboy on how far he was willing to go.

&quot;...Well, if your aim is crap, they probably can. Hahghahgha.&quot; He laughed and coughed at the same time. &quot;But let&#39;s make things clear: You work for me too. I say something, you listen. If you got doubts, save them for after I&#39;ve saved your ass.&quot; He warned.

&quot;Unless you&#39;d rather give me a lil&#39; speech in the middle of a fight, of all things.&quot; He rolled his eyes. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Mind games happen to be a specialty of mine, if you haven&#39;t noticed.&gt;

He didn&#39;t need to brag; his mastery over manipulation was evident in the creatures accompanying him 24/7. Be they human, monster, or something in between, the Skinwalkers performed their duties, even in the face of agony. They were truly the definition of corporate slaves.

Bill, on the other hand, was anything but. He would never be, and deep down, Lachlan knew that. It would normally take him weeks or even months to fully condition a puppet and bring it under his control. A strong personality like Archer, without only days to spare, couldn&#39;t possibly be tamed.

And that was why the Command Seals were necessary.

Lachlan didn&#39;t regret expending that first stroke. It had served its purpose in multiple ways, but most importantly, it showed Bill that he could and <em>would</em> use them if he ever felt the need to.

He reached into his mana reserves, flexing his magic circuits and readying a Healing spell. Bill&#39;s sloppy patch job had stemmed the bleeding, even though he would most likely have to fix the needlework later. For now, though, he should focus on healing the insides.

&lt;Switch to Spirit Form to conserve your strength,&gt; he nudged Bill with his knee. The back of the car was becoming rather cramped, with the cowboy wedging himself between the Master and the Dancer. &lt;I&#39;ve still got a lot of patching up to do, so that hand of yours will have to wait.&gt;

Shifting gears, he turned his attention to their next steps. &lt;You and that Lancer really did a number on my Skinwalkers. It&#39;s going to take some time to repair them as well.&gt; He paused, as an idea struck him. It made his eyes twitch as he tried to suppress his amusement.

&quot;Yeah yeah. Not like you&#39;d want my help anyway.&quot; Bill scoffed as Lachlan tapped him. He dissolved into particles, leaving his corporeal form as he was nothing more than an invisible cloud of Spiritrons now, observing his Master from a close distance.

<em>&lt;I&#39;m pretty sure the Lancer is more relevant to this than I am.&gt;</em> The cowboy added as Lachlan started criticizing him for his treatment of the puppets. <em>&lt;You&#39;re barking up the wrong tree here.

<em>&lt;A horse? Don&#39;t make me laugh! Do I look like a Rider to you?!&gt;</em> Bill spat out instantly, much to Lachlan&#39;s surprise. <em>&lt;You summoned an Archer.

After all, Lachlan didn&#39;t seem like the type to offer something, unless it directly benefitted him in terms of amusement.

<em>&lt;Bottom line is, don&#39;t give me a horse. <strong>Ever.</strong> I don&#39;t need one.&gt;</em> Bill groaned to the point that Lachlan could envision his Servant&#39;s face, visibly cringing on the outside. <em>&lt;Now are you done with your questions?&gt;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

They don&#39;t offer bundle deals where you come from? I thought summoning services should come with some added perks. Like a complimentary steed. You don&#39;t strike me as the expensive type, after all.&gt;</em> Lachlan still sounded amused. Perhaps Bill&#39;s transformation into a bundle of spiritrons had minimized the threat he had posed; it seemed that the Dowling brat was feeling rather bold now...

<em>&lt;Sounds like someone&#39;s in denial.&gt;</em> Lachlan found the needle Bill had used somewhere on the car seat - thank god no one had sat on it - and dumped it into the med kit. Several thoughts crossed his mind while he fumbled with his tools, but they refused to surface, and thus remained elusive to Bill. Something was brewing, and Bill could tell that he wasn&#39;t privy to all the details.

Hadn&#39;t they just agreed to be transparent with each other? But on the other hand, did he really <em>want</em> to know? Dilemmas, indeed...

<em>&lt;We won&#39;t be seeing the Lancer again.&gt;</em>

Lachlan looked rather pensive. <em>&lt;I&#39;m not foolish enough to send an ill-matched Servant against that wolf. Once was more than enough. You and him, never again. That wolf possesses something, something that counters your bullets. Let the other Servants deal with him.&gt;</em>

It wasn&#39;t a declaration of defeat; rather, he was making a clear-headed judgement after breaking down the current situation. Bill had shown the extent of his capabilities tonight - or so he had thought - therefore, it only seemed logical to minimize the risks. 

Besides, with so many Servants roaming the island, it was only a matter of time before Roland&#39;s videotape started generating a buzz.

<em>&lt;For now, we keep a low profile, and pick off the weaker targets. Should be right up your alley, no?&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

You&#39;re the one who summoned me. Should have prayed for a Rider instead.&gt;</em> Bill grumbled at Lachlan&#39;s teasing, wishing the boy would just go back to stitching themselves. Despite their condition, however, they seemed to be lively enough to indulge in both jokes (at Bill&#39;s expense) and plans.

<em>&lt;I&#39;m telling you: I had that mutt under control.&gt;</em> Bill spat back, still insistent that he could have taken down Lancer were it not for Lachlan&#39;s issues with the Adler heir. However, he refrained from taking it further as Lachlan explained what he envisioned next.

<em>&lt;Hmmm,&gt;</em> Bill was deep in thought. <em>&lt;That sounds good. Not too different from my line of work, really.&gt;</em> He laughed. <em>&lt;But you get rid of all the riffraff and the strong ones start thriving. It&#39;s better to let some of the small fry tire out the actual threats, dontcha think? Lancer can be one of them, but once people take the bait and he&#39;s gone? There&#39;ll still be plenty left.&gt;</em>

Bill&#39;s logic made sense, but it also didn&#39;t offer a solution. If getting rid of the weaker Servants was counterproductive, then what exactly could he and his Master do?

<em>&lt;We could just wait.&gt;</em> Bill proposed. <em>&lt;Wait until the rest of the competition killed each other and are now headed for the Grail. Then we swipe it off them.&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350469164970074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350469164970074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:36 PM">6:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It only took me a decade to become somewhat proficient at it.&gt;</em>

What were a few days of twiddling his thumbs compared to the long wait he had endured to crawl back into his own shoes? In a matter of days, he would awaken to a much quieter Berenice. With the dragon wreaking havoc in the center of the island, unsolved murders popping up left and right, and innocent convicts like Marcus and his monstrous Servant who were being framed, the Church and its allies would undoubtedly spread themselves thin in order to hunt down the suspects.

Before joining in on the action, it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to gather some...<em>human</em> resources first.

&lt;Suppose information holds significant power in modern warfare. Stay sharp then, Archer, and be a good scout for me. Since you <strong>aren&#39;t</strong> a rider, it should be fairly easy for you to blend in with the crowd and gather intelligence that way, yeah?&gt;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Cry me a river, pal.&gt;</em> Bill replied, noticing the slight twitching in Lachlan&#39;s face. Clearly, he had been planning this Holy Grail War for a long time. He didn&#39;t know why at first, but upon seeing how strongly Lachlan felt about his father, it felt pretty obvious.

<em>&lt;You can either dwell on whatever crappy past you had, or take up the gun and win this war. I&#39;m not going to let either of us hold us down.&gt;</em> Bill warned. If they were truly equals, then Lachlan could take a bit of ribbing. They went back to discussing work just seconds later, with Lachlan noticing that his supplies of puppets were slowly dwindling. In cases like this, someone needed a good butcher.

<em>&lt;Heh. Sending me into the trenches? Why am I not surprised?&gt;</em> Bill joked, staring at the road ahead. It was only a few miles to reach Berenice&#39;s more populated districts, which meant a fresh supply of bodies for Lachlan to take advantage of. He had to give the Church credit where it was due: The island&#39;s size and general unimportance made it easier for rumors to coalesce into one big pot. It also meant that if anyone went missing, few people around the world would care about them.

Plus, it meant that Bill would be able to wander on this own. Unsupervised, hopefully. It seemed like a more than fair trade off in exchange for his services. 

<em>&lt;Sure. I can do that. It&#39;s pretty easy for rumors to spread, no matter how tight you and your group are. Believe me.&gt;</em> He laughed, remembering the rumors spread across the West about the Cook gang, especially when it came to Bill&#39;s nature. Being half Cherokee was quite unpopular, so by that same logic, witnessing a man with a wolf as their head would make quite the splash.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1110350656075743255 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1110350656075743255><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, May 22, 2023 6:37 PM">6:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;But for now, get yourself patched. Not like I&#39;m gonna go asking people questions at midnight.&gt;</em> He groaned, Lachlan hearing a deep yawn in the corner of his ear. <em>&lt;I&#39;m going to sleep. If someone bothers you, just give a good scream or I won&#39;t hear you. Hahah.&gt;</em> Bill gave a weak laugh, before Lachlan felt as if something had been severed from his mind. It felt relatively quiet, to the point he could hear his own thoughts again. Finally, he was on his own. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill had disconnected himself from the telepathic link and went offline. All that remained was the faint buzzing of the puppets he had compartmentalized in another corner of his mind. The Dancer, now calm and docile, curled up on the other side of the car.

Lachlan rubbed the back of his neck. It still prickled slightly where the Command Seal had activated. Two more bindings remained on Bill before he could reclaim his freedom. Until that day arrived...

<em>He could do this. He could work with the man.</em> Lachlan psyched himself up. <em>Like the Archer said, there&#39;s no point in dwelling on the past. Just a few more days, then he&#39;d get to the end, and then...and then it&#39;s over, right? Simple. Grail attained, and all&#39;s done.</em> 

He glanced at the car window, his gaze drifting beyond into the sky. Though the clouds had passed over the moon, he could still imagine its presence above — round, radiant, and ever watchful.

<em>Simple,</em> he said to himself. <em>Yes.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>
