That was the knowledge the Grail imparted onto Philoctetes, at least. It was smart to make swift contact with where information pertaining to the War made a beeline for— the logic held up. So the moment he left the McDonalds with Charlotte, Archer made a beeline for the Church.

Or at least, he was supposed to. He kept it a secret to his Master that he ended up a tad bit distracted and took the long path to the place.

Even if Philoctetes didn’t know beforehand that Berenice only had one Church, it wasn’t particularly hard to the location using his Clairvoyance. The same excellent eyesight ended up being his downfall, though. From something as remarkable as sightseeing towers to something as mundane as a gas station, almost everything was a source of curiosity that pulled Philoctetes away from the quickest path to the Church.

By the time they had arrived, it had already turned midnight.

“We still haven’t found a place to play this bad boy in. You think the Church would have a CD player?”

Charlotte’s collection of her favorite music still went unheard. Turned out it was surprisingly challenging to find somewhere to stick a CD into in public. Most people kept theirs at home, after all.

Although, considering the time, it seemed like a bit of a challenge to get an audience. It didn’t exactly sound too appealing waiting until the next morning with no lodging either, though… and they were already here.

“… Yo, we need to wake up whoever’s in there anyways. Wanna start blasting music? I’d rather save my voice until we go into battle.”

Archer wasn’t exactly sure if his voice could even grow hoarse, but even if it couldn’t, they’d probably prefer it to his yelling. Without a second thought, he threw the troublesome responsibility onto his Master.

“I <em>will</em> shout if you don’t play, though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She agreed that meeting the overseer would be a logical course of action after summoning ones servant and a nice nigh time stroll was always pleasant. 

the time of night when they arrived at the church read on Charlottes watch as 9pm where she still had no adjusted it for the new time zone, it certainly felt like midnight however. She assumed that Philoctetes would have been curious about the surrounding area in their walk however even if he was he certainly didn&#39;t seem it. 

&quot;No we haven&#39;t found a cd player, there dont tend to be cd players dotted about for you to just chuck music into and i doubt a religious establishment would have one, they tend to have organs etc&quot;

she wasn&#39;t sure if the overseer would need waking, a relatively young night coupled with the wars events usually taking place at night gave her the impression that overseers were night shift people.

The discovery wasn&#39;t surprising, of course, considering that midnight was fast approaching. Most sensible people with an equally sensible schedule would have retired to bed by this time.

As they ascended the steps, however, two things happened at once.

The first thing that caught their attention was a construction sign hanging prominently on the front door, bearing the following message:

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">⚠️ HEADS UP ⚠️
WE ARE UNDER RENOVATION
We are renovating the Berenice Church to make it a more enjoyable experience for you. See you again next year. Thank you for your patience!</code>
To an unsuspecting traveler, it would appear that the church was temporarily closed for renovations. However, to any seasoned magus or Servant, it was easy to sense that something else was at play. Faint traces of magecraft lingered in the air, and as they neared the inner perimeters of the building, it felt as though they had passed through a barrier — not intended as a trap, but it was clear that some sort of detection magecraft had been triggered by their presence.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1094035835755708497 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1094035835755708497><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, April 7, 2023 6:07 PM">6:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tachipoyo">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="saltmine.5433">@saltie</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The silence was much less welcoming, though.

“You left them? Why not bring it around? If its your main medium for Magecraft, might as well keep yourself defended.”

It wasn’t too much of a trouble, though. At least as long as Philoctetes was around. While it was a bit inconvenient to his impatient personality that an easy way to cause ruckus wasn’t readily made available, he was good at adapting.

“See? No response. Would be much quicker to just… you said this building echoes a lot, yeah?”

Philoctetes took a calm, controlled tone as he began walking over to the nearest tree. Maintained the same relaxed atmosphere as he shot a quick arrow at its trunk, separating it in half, and grabbing the trunk with both of his arms.

Easily lifting an object twice his own body length, he began bashing the tree into the side of the building with a completely straight face.

<strong>”Heyyy! Wake up! You’ve got visitors!”</strong></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The silence she had expected as it was an unsociable hour of the night and unless one was out drinking most would be either in bed or about to be. Although she had expected the overseer to be awake at least.

&quot;Yes i did leave them. I didn&#39;t plan on fighting anybody or playing generally so left them behind i didn&#39;t want the extra weight. Besides we are on church ground now anyway and combat between masters here is prohibited although I dont need to tell you that.&quot; 

she poked his nose as if she were bullying him for his concern. Although she believed part of this concern to be him not being able to hear any live music the night of his summoning - what a shame. 

&quot;Yes id expect it to echo a lot , the inside tends to be a large hall with stone structures causing the sound to reflect a lot, wait what are you-&quot;

The loud cry that jumped out of his throat and through the church doors caught Charlotte off guard in the sheer volume of sound piercing her eardrums like a sharp blade. 

&quot;Don&#39;t wake up the whole street you numpty!!&quot; Charlotte of course did not want to draw attention to the pair outside a church with construction signs, they&#39;d look like lost drunks although not with a yell as clear as Philoctetes was

Upon the second &#39;knock&#39;, pieces of paint chipped off the wall, the entire building seemed to tremble in response. The Berenice Church wasn&#39;t particularly big as far as churches went; it clearly felt the force of Philoctetes&#39; blow, betraying the seemingly sturdy appearance of its exterior.

Impatient for a response, Philoctetes raised the tree trunk again—

Complying with the tired Sister’s request, Philoctetes dropped the large tree with a thud. Blissfully unaware of the structural damages he’s caused, and to the amount of stress Rosula had been subject to, which he’s only added on top of.

Although, it <em>was</em> her job. He imagined late arrivals were more than accounted for.

“I’m Archer, and the young lady over there is my Master. You were expecting us, yes? Catch us up a little bit here.”

There were a few dozen questions worth asking to the overseer. Information such as how many Servants have been summoned, and… establishing a backup plan for when his Master dropped out of the war. Last but not least…

“… By the way, you don’t happen to have a CD Player anywhere, do you?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Philoctetes obsession with getting hold of a cd player in whatever odd place he could was certainly peculiar, he could just wait for them to return home and she&#39;d let him use hers afterall.

What a privilege it was to be young!

&#39;It is as you said,&#39; she nodded to them both. &#39;I was informed of your visit, though I wasn&#39;t aware that by late, he meant past midnight. But still, better late than never.&#39; 

She managed a reassuring smile before turning aside to open the door wider. 

&#39;Would you like to come in?&#39; She asked, gesturing towards the inside of the church. &#39;Though we have wards set up around the building, it&#39;s still a good idea to be more discrete.

Didn’t sound at all like he had his priorities straight.

“Downtown, is it? I’ll try my luck there tomorrow.”

He set the CD away carefully for the time being— these were supposed to be quite delicate, right? Best to treat it as such.

“I’ll be letting myself in, then~ This place is supposed to be a place to communicate with ‘God’, yeah? Still, seems pretty meaningless to talk to an unresponsive deity to me.”

For someone who lived in the Age of Gods, often getting direct answers from the divine, the concept of a ‘Church’ seemed bizarre. Sure, they had temples in Greece, but those seemed a lot more… practical.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Contrary to their haphazard greeting, her words seemed to flow more effortlessly this time, as if she had answered many questions of a similar nature prior to Archer&#39;s visit.

“Maybe a good start would be to ask how many Servants have been confirmed by the Church at the moment. That way, this one gets a better image on how many heads she’s going to need to take in the War.”

Philoctetes laid himself back on one of the chairs, getting a feel for how it felt. He was curious as to how the chairs of this era were created, after all. Plastic had a much different feel to the wooden chairs he was used to… still wasn’t entirely sure which he preferred, so wherever the opportunity arose, he made sure to seat himself down.

Her lack of mana seemed a little odd for an overseer however that was to be expected, the Grail war doesn&#39;t usually occur in this nation after all. 


She found the next question Philoctetes asked to be a tad disturbing - particularly in the way it was phrased. She didn&#39;t want to kill people as if it was some sport. 

&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t phrase it like that at least respect the act of killing. It&#39;s not some shallow deed like putting a bed together&quot; She knew killing was difficult but the way he acted as if it was some game upset her a fair bit. 

However she did also want to know how many servants the church had confirmed for this war so she could prepare herself more easily for the conflict. 

&quot;However, that information would be most useful for our strategies&quot; clearly a bluff as Philoctetes was aware she didn&#39;t have any plans at all.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The act of taking a life. It was quite the sacrilegious topic to discuss within the confines of a holy ground, but Rosula had no choice but to come to terms with it as the Holy Grail War loomed. Her perception of the Holy Church had changed quite a lot in these weeks. The meeting of eclectic Masters and their even more enigmatic Servants only served to challenge her beliefs more.

There were Masters like Marcus Adler, who openly expressed their willingness to kill in order to fulfill their self-proclaimed, noble wishes. Then there were Servants like Philoctetes, who hailed from a time when death was rampant and killing was normalized. The stark contrast between the values of the modern world and those of the past was overwhelming.

Yet amidst the chaos, Rosula found solace in encounter Masters like Charlotte, who still behaved like ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances. A reminder that not all participants of the Holy Grail War had lost their human touch. 

However...

&#39;The Holy Grail War is a gruesome affair, as far as I&#39;m aware,&#39; Rosula looked at Charlotte with a worried expression. &#39;We have already received reports of casualties, both from within Egypt and overseas. As much as it inconveniences me to speak of violence, I&#39;m afraid your Servant has the right idea. It&#39;s best to remain vigilant, especially for a lady like you.&#39;

She shifted her attention to Archer, and recalled the reports she had been diligently compiling earlier in the evening. &#39;Including you, as well as those who have already been disqualified, my colleagues and I have confirmed the presence of 18 Servants so far. However, there are still more who have refused to announce themselves to the Church. <strong>Ruler</strong> is tracking them down as we speak, and he estimates that there are at least 10 more in hiding.&#39;

You should really listen to her. Best to look out for your self sooner. ‘Later’ might be after your head gets severed, after all.”

The grim reality was that after once you got conscripted, you had little leeway for hesitation. It was a reality his Master had yet to accept, and while he had originally dropped the topic, he’d take any opportunity to get to drill it in. It would greatly inconvenience him if she died, and he had already silently promised to keep her safe, after all.

In that order.

Only after Rosula revealed just how many pairs there were did it become exceptionally clear how little leeway <em>was</em> available. The Holy Grail War was supposed to be a system designed with 7 Servants in mind, wasn’t it? An upwards of 28 was irregular.

“Nice. Means we have plenty of targets.”

It was far from an ideal situation, but he didn’t come here to do an easy, cushy job. A bit of turmoil was more than welcome.

“I missed out on all the fireworks during the Trojan War, it seems like I’ll get to have some casual fun around here.”

His nonchalance was a little bit scary, in a sense.

“… I’ve been thinking since earlier, but you don’t seem all too happy, priestess. Isn’t this what you signed up for?”

Given the circumstances, it was shocking that Rosula was able to keep up a professional outlook. But in spite of her best efforts, it wasn’t all too surprising that her unwillingness to oversee what was effectively organized murder would peek through.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She insisted that she was capable of killing other masters when the time arrived however she didn&#39;t want the act of it to be referred to so lightly. 

&quot;I&#39;m perfectly capable of killing thank you sister however I just didn&#39;t like the phrasing as it seemed to be treating the deed as if we were playing some game&quot;  

The casualty reports Rosula spoke of were quite upsetting indeed, &quot;Were most of the casualties civilians then?&quot; as far as she was aware the war was to be kept away from the innocent civilians and between the masters however these reports suggested this rule was not being kept to at all - perhaps they should track down the perpetrator(s) of these crims.

The information regarding the number of servants certainly caught Charlotte of guard, as far as she was aware the grail war consisted of 7 masters and servants not around 28! It was quite a shock for her as the realisation that shed have to kill far more people than she expected crept into her thoughts - well only for a second she quickly went to ignore this pushing it out of mind, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people are participating as she only has to kill those she encounters. 

She found Philcotetes&#39; carefree attitude toward the fighting a little nerve wrecking he really did see it as some game, she got a tad lost in thought zoning out trying to justify his attitude toward it all, surely other masters felt as though it wasn&#39;t some act of amusement? Surely they felt it was quite a heavy deed to take ones life and not similar to that of sport?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Confused, then flustered as she realized what Philoctetes had been calling her. Awkwardly, she waved her hands. 

&#39;Please, call me Sister Rosula,&#39; she said. &#39;While I&#39;m a member of this church, I&#39;m not the one in charge of overseeing the Holy Grail War. That responsibility falls on Father Andreas and Mr. Gabriele. As a local, my primary role is to assist them in acclimating to living in Berenice, and any other way possible.&#39;

She lowered her gaze and fell silent for a moment, as if collecting her thoughts. When she looked up again, there was a renewed hint of hesitation in her eyes.

&#39;I have been serving the church for years, and I have seen my share of the good and bad. But this Holy Grail War...&#39; She bit her lips. &#39;It&#39;s on another level entirely, to call it &quot;dangerous&quot; would be an understatement. I don&#39;t have the exact numbers, but Father Andreas suspects that some of the death reports coming from the island and beyond were caused by the actions of Servants. For what purpose, I cannot fathom.&#39;

Rosula smiled ruefully. Within the walls of the Berenice church, she was shielded from the ugliness of the War. But beyond the safety of this sanctuary was a battlefield with no designated rules, where the strong preyed upon the weak, and in turn met their end at the hands of someone stronger still. It was a world she was not familiar with, and frankly, a world that frightened her.

&#39;Forgive me for asking, but I have to wonder, what toll does this endless cycle of violence take on a hero like yourself?&#39; She asked Philoctetes.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 12:10 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098342572671389776 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098342572671389776><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 3:21 PM">3:21 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tachipoyo">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="saltmine.5433">@saltie</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I think &#39;priestess&#39; is less of a mouthful, but I&#39;ll oblige if you insist, Sister Rosula.&quot;

Perhaps in some places, the information given from the Grail was a little bit too formalized, with less regard as to the societal norms.

... Either that, or Philoctetes himself paid little mind to the social information given to him. It was hard to tell.

As he listened to Rosula&#39;s words, the situation became clearer. The lack of mana signature coming off of her wasn&#39;t a mistake. She was no different from a civilian who got dragged into the mess out of circumstance.

&quot;... Its honestly shocking that you can afford to stay worried about others in such a dire predicament.&quot;

Philoctetes himself wasn&#39;t sure if he could do the same. While the Archer had been trained as a warrior his whole life, he was more familiar with feeling powerless than he wanted to admit.

Partly because of that familiarity, he was able to answer Rosula&#39;s question without much pause.

&quot;I&#39;m just a person the same as you are, Sister. Which is to say that the toll itself doesn&#39;t change much. You never really get used to the smell of blood, all you can do is distract yourself from it.&quot;

&quot;The difference is that for me, the distractions were more accessible. Achilles was drunk off his own power, Odysseus was too busy trying to go back home safely to bother... and when I was younger, making sure I lived up to Heracles&#39;s legacy was more than enough to let me not bat an eye towards the falling corpses.&quot;

He spoke with the slightest bitter smile, as though reminiscing old times. Back when he was even more thoughtless.

&quot;As for this one, she came into the War with a solid &#39;distraction&#39; of minimizing unnecessary deaths, it seems.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1098392466513739847 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1098392466513739847><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 19, 2023 6:39 PM">6:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Continuing, he began forcefully patting Charlotte&#39;s head.

Parts of what they said found themselves scattering into her thoughts such as Rosula&#39;s name and Philoctetes inquiries about the church. 

She was still puzzled however and found herself pondering how someone could so easily kill so many just to live up to some legacy or perhaps even for the sake of it, that had to be why other servants had been killing civilians - their masters must have been unable to reign them in and the servants simply had a thirst for blood.

But why? why would they so carelessly massacre innocence - people unconnected to the war entirely. 

These poor souls caught up in a conflict they have no knowledge of, it was something that didn&#39;t sit right with Charlotte. 

It was about here she felt Philoctetes pushing down on her head exerting far too much force causing a sharp pain in her neck as he pushed down on her

&quot;Hey! Stop that you it hurts&quot; she had tried to grab his arm to push it away while rubbing her neck where the pain had stemmed from. &quot;You really are such a brute sometimes try to be a tad more careful wont you&quot; 

She felt as thought this was very much an accident on his part where he was still adjusting to the modern world however that didn&#39;t mean it was pain free for her far more fragile body. 

&quot;Sorry to intrude&quot; 

now speaking directly to Philoctetes in response to his questioning of God 

&quot;People keep trying because the teachings of the past that are passed down through religious books are what people have faith in, its not the response itself (or lack of) that matters it&#39;s that fact that people simply believe that it will get better&quot; 

She felt a tad rude interjecting as she did however she was worried he would offend the sister and wanted to avoid such a development answering herself 

&quot;I think that sums it up sister Rosula - right?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was well past the age where she wore he emotions on her sleeve; unlike the young Master who was trying to hush her Servant for speaking out, Rosula simply smiled and shook her head as she considered his question.

&#39;When it comes down to it, prayers really are just a matter of personal faith and interpretation. There&#39;s no inherently right or wrong way to approach it. If you find solace in communicating with God, then that&#39;s beneficial in some way. It&#39;s not much different from confiding in a close friend or a loved one.&#39;

She paused, lost in thought as she recalled the words of the Masters and Servant who had come through the doors over the weeks. They too had expressed a range of emotions, from confidence to sadness, from indifference to reluctance. But despite their differing attitudes towards the War, or even a member of a Church, weren&#39;t their words also prayers in some way?

&#39;...in the end, I believe that it&#39;s the faith behind one&#39;s actions that really makes the difference.&#39;

Rosula let her gaze drift to the stations of the cross that adorned the church&#39;s dimly lit walls. 

&#39;As someone who is excluded from the War itself, I am helpless to intervene,&#39; she explained. &#39;There is little I can do aside from worry about the safety of the participants, which I admit, feels like a futile effort sometimes. But if this is the only way I can contribute, then I&#39;m always happy to do so. Besides—&#39;

She held out her arms and gestured around her.

&#39;—the Church is a sanctioned area where fighting is strictly prohibited. I believe any violation to this rule would lead to persecution by the Executor and other rule-abiding Masters. So please, allow me the pleasure of prayers, as insignificant as they may seem.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1099744059125415976 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1099744059125415976><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, April 23, 2023 12:10 PM">12:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tachipoyo">@Tachi</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="saltmine.5433">@saltie</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Charlotte comprehended Philoctetes’s rather careless actions as a result of him not being used to his new container.

In reality, he was just bad with people. Nothing more, nothing less. Philoctetes being oblivious on how to interact with others was a trend that existed even when he led an army in the Trojan War.

Not a habit he ever really broke out of.

“I wasn’t really planning on going as far as to say you shouldn’t pray. No reason to rob that away from someone. I just didn’t understand <em>why</em> you did. For that matter, confiding in a close friend… don’t really get that one either.”

It still didn’t make perfect sense in his head, in spite of both Charlotte and Rosula’s efforts to illuminate the issue. Perhaps it should have been no surprise— Philoctetes had been historically bad at understanding other people.

But still, the conversation helped him get a rough idea.

“‘Faith’ is way easier to understand, though. Its a matter of the heart, yeah?”

Prayers were a matter of personal faith and interpretation.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100012573669212224 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100012573669212224><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, April 24, 2023 5:57 AM">5:57 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“… If I’m thinking about it like that, it seems a lot less glamorous than how the Grail made it out to be. I’m guessing its a way of taking some emotion and expressing the wish for it to come true.”

Praying for safety. Praying for forgiveness. Praying for prosperity. Human desires gathered to form emotions, and those emotions were expressed outwards as prayers. That’s how Philoctetes decided to understand it.

“The image of the Church was a lot more glorified in the social impressions I’ve gotten, but I couldn’t understand why. I understand it even less now. Its just a ground for people to gather and wish, and human wishes are rarely ever perfectly pretty.”

The Holy Grail War was good evidence of that fact. That realization sank in for everyone present, listening to Philoctetes’s nonsensical rambling. The casualties already shown was a good example of the lengths people were willing to go to in order to turn their prayers into reality.

“Not that I’m any exception. I guess I got disqualified from saying anything from the moment I’ve been willing to bloody my hands.”

Philoctetes stared at Rosula for a short moment, lost in thought.

“… I wonder which you are. If you have something to pray for, that means you have something to wish for, right? If you’re willing to go far enough for it, I’m sure you can figure out some way to snatch the Grail out of the winner’s hands. Not that it’d be easy without a Servant.”

Praying for forgiveness.

“I guess it doesn’t really matter to me until I win the Grail, though.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She felt as though it was a careless accident however that did not elevate the pain itself.

She spent a few moments tending to her sore neck while the other two spoke, The internal questioning of how other masters may view killing had left her mind as she listened more intently to Philoctetes relentlessly questioning the point of her prayers and her defending her faith. She felt as though she could provide an alternate reason for the importance of the church however wanted to wait until a significant pause occurred in their speech.  

&quot;Well religion in the past was also used to explain many questions such as the origin of the earth for example as we had not yet understood the real causes of these things that modern science has revealed to us&quot; Philoctetes interpretation of faith was certainly a reasonable way of looking at modern religion however one must consider its place over all of human history too. 

She certainly understood where a glorified image of the church could come from, during the medieval eras the church held considerable power over European monarchies for example, in fact the Pope&#39;s would declare several &quot;crusades&quot; over the time frame essentially amassing and army in the name of Catholicism (something Charlotte found grossly distasteful when studying) 

 &quot;Personally I saw religion as a bit of a comforting way to explain things that frightened our ancestors and therefore it became a bit of a well rooted tradition whether the Gods truly exist or not the act of trying can be comforting for some&quot; She wasn&#39;t overly religious herself finding what those found in prayers in her music. The art of making music was what comforted her most during trying times.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1100455380959645736 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1100455380959645736><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, April 25, 2023 11:16 AM">11:16 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;Perhaps we should be on our way Archer?

Though Rosula supposed it was only to be expected. After all, no Heroic Spirit would deign to answer the Grail&#39;s call if they weren&#39;t driven by wishes and ambitions of their own.

At the end of the day, no matter how many lofty ideals were exchanged, the reality was that everyone still existed in a world where self-preservation was paramount. And so the nun nodded agreement, deciding to be honest with her thoughts as well.

&#39;I believe that having a wish is a fundamental part of being human. Which is why I must admit, I too have my own wants and needs. But not every wish is strong enough to require the power of a Holy Grail, just like how you don&#39;t always need special tools to tend to a garden. Sometimes, a simple pair of hands is more than enough.&#39;

She clasped her own calloused hands in front of her chest, and bowed her head slightly. 

&#39;As someone who has neither the strength nor conviction to engage in battle, I would be more than happy to offer my meager support from the sidelines. And, of course, I wouldn&#39;t mind to the occasional visit. The prospect of meeting legendary figures of the past still fascinates me to no end,&#39; she extended her offer.

Perhaps it was best someone like that was picked as an overseer. It seemed like he wouldn’t have to worry about the Grail being snatched away… at least not by <em>her</em>. That was one faction he could tentatively worry about less.

It didn’t seem like she was lying either, as far as Philoctetes could tell. She responded to most of his questions with fatigued neutralities. He decided to trust that she had no desire for the Grail. 

In stark contrast to his Master who, in spite of her naiveties, showed energetic enthusiasm to get her wishes granted.

“Just like how you make music, and I chase after glory, faith is just another way of tackling your fears… huh? I can accept that.”

Getting up from the chair, he nodded towards the door while looking at Charlotte. He had both fulfilled his personal curiosities, and managed to judge how amicable the Overseer would be. Their act here was done.

“I’ll let girlie over here pick the time next time, then. It just seems foreign to me that someone would be asleep at this hour during wartime. I hear once, the enemy King slipped into our camp while everyone was sleeping. Crazy stuff.”

“I enjoyed our little conversation. I’ll make sure we can have another one day.”

He had no intention of losing to begin with, but it was a nice little cherry on top.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She started to follow Philoctetes toward the door he had bashed in with a tree, maybe the church should have some real work done after his shenanigans. 

&quot;Girlie?&quot; This sort of nicknaming caught her a little of guard however she didn&#39;t mind it, &quot;also remember this war is kept secret and fighting on church grounds is forbidden - only someone insane would dare break these rules&quot;
