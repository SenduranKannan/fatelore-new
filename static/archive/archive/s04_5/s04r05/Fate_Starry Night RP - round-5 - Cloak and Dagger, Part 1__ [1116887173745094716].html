The blaring sirens of vehicles carrying those fighting for their life.

The cacophony of whispers, sneezes, coughs, and cries of both sorrow and joy distracting enough for one to not notice the endless buzzing of phosphorescent lights.

All instruments in the chaotic orchestra that makes up the atmosphere of a small hospital.

Such as the one in Berenice.

While well-lit and well-furnished, the pale, bleached color of every wall, every tile, every ceiling tile made the waiting room seem like some sort of nuthouse, especially for those whose wait has long since eroded any amount of patience they once had in waiting for their loved one’s return from the gloves of the nurses and doctors desperately doing everything they can to keep them alive, giving way to fear, anxiety, and an overwhelming sense of dread.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was the scent.

Cleaning chemicals, aging medical equipment… the irony scent of blood… all worked together to create a cocktail of olfactory unease for the American doctor. 

Days had passed since what he believed to be the complete and utter annihilation of the decrepit hotel he’d been running an emergency clinic from. Another casualty of the Grail War. A war that had - since its beginning - seen a rise in disappearances and fatalities on the small island. If there had to be a positive in all of this, it was that the hospital’s director had been more than willing to take Dr. Florenstine’s charitable offer: He would stay at the hospital for as long as need be, and, in return, he would do everything he could to help.

New bodies - some living, some not-so-alive, some fresh, some long rotten - had been piling in nearly every hour of the day, to the point that even a big city surgeon like him began to feel overwhelmed. Dehydrated, famished, and weary from a lack of sleep, he’d navigated through the halls of the hospital by simply stumbling around, until finally finding himself in the waiting room.

He was uncertain of how much time had passed since then. To those who’d had a quick trip in and out of the building, it may have seemed to them as if he were a painted statue, unmoving and seemingly unaware of anything going on around him. If only that were the case.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116887555355463731 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116887555355463731><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 7:32 PM">7:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was maddening to the doctor that he’d seen little to no sense of urgency from the locals since all of this began. Hell, it was as if there were no cause for concern at all. No one seemed to notice the undying rush of people coming and going, those forced to wait either isolated in a pod or absorbed into some cheap form of entertainment. Sickening was the word for it. Then again, he knew better than to judge people like that. In a place where tourism is equivalent to livelihood, it isn’t rare to see poker-faced and iron-willed individuals doing as much as they can to act like nothing is happening, even at times like this. 

Yet, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something far, far worse than what had already transpired was just on the horizon. Something that would shake this place to its core.

Just as that thought would pass - as if on-queue - a foreign man dressed in a trench coat would burst through the doors, screaming incomprehensible bloody murder. One glimpse of the coat, and the doctor would sink down into the chair, his instincts screaming at him to get out of there as soon as possible. But what kind of doctor would he be if he fled a hospital?

Quickly enough, Florence would regain enough composure to get a better look at the man, whose screaming and yelling seemed to have had a similar effect on just about everyone else present. In that moment of silence, the doctor would realize the difference between two halves of the audience. To the man’s left side - the side he was sat to - the occupants of that half of the room seemed little more than suddenly surprised, with many having already gone back to whatever it was they were doing before. To the man’s right side, however, there was a sea of horrified expressions, with one woman sitting closer to where the man was standing having failed to prevent herself from vomiting on the floor.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1116887604160372786 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1116887604160372786><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 9, 2023 7:32 PM">7:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A trail of blood too thick to be from a simple, small wound led from the door to where the man had now collapsed… he’d… collapsed… 

Before he knew it, Florence found himself at the man’s side, tearing a piece off of his shirt to wrap as tightly as possible around the small stump that once led to the rest of an arm. Though the man struggled against the doctor, no attempt at physical harm was made… only an attempt to crawl further into the hospital before passing out. That or-

Farther away from the entrance.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A shadow would appear over the doctor and the man whose life he was attempting to save with a mere scrap of cloth. The natural reaction was to turn his head to the person speaking, but the voice gave the doctor pause.

“...<em>Ahem.</em> Doctor?”

It seemed as though everything had gone quiet. If the waiting room hadn&#39;t been asylum-like before, it surely was now. 

Assassin - awaiting Florence’s reply - would stand there, unmoving, tens of pairs of eyes staring upon him.

One moment of silence would pass. Then another. Then another.

<em>Step. Step. Step. Step.</em>

Crouching down at the side of the fainted man, Mudgett’s appearance would finally be known to the doctor. The same appearance that had shaken the rest of the waiting room into silence, for it looked as if not one moment had passed since his fight against Sri Kalki. 

Assassin’s right arm was missing entirely, as was a reasonable portion of the suit and skin around it, the damage spanning from his face to the center of his torso. How he had remained so unperturbed despite these injuries was beyond those watching, the same unknown that beckoned them to shut their traps and keep an eye on the situation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Dark warmth would envelop Florence’s face, leaving him completely blind as to what had occurred. Taking off his glasses, the doctor would reach for what remained of the bottom of his shirt. 

Everything was fuzzy, completely blurred as a result of the doctor’s steadily worsening sight. One thing remained perfectly clear, however: A bright crimson covered nearly everything he could see.

Shrieks would erupt throughout the room, as if they were in a movie theater and had been jumpscared by the horror movie they were watching. Sensing something wrong, the doctor would rush the cleaning job on his glasses before setting them back on his face.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a single, swift kick to the jaw, the doctor would be brought down. Pleased with his performance, Assassin would store his knife back into his coat.

“Easy to know who is in danger when <em>you</em> are the danger, isn’t it? Now, then…”

Reaching his now open hand up to the sky, a weapon would materialize out of thin air and into his grasp. The remaining Tool of Desecration - a surprise tool he knew would help him later - had been summoned.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The events of the week before this one were nothing short of exhausting, if not mortal.  Time was needed to convalesce, to get over the hang-ups of all the drama that had occurred, to reform and renew one&#39;s self, and all other manner of pseudo-philosophical nonsense - now, it was time to hunt.

The faint glimpses of a greater reality manifested from the mind of Ruler had been what the two had to go off of, even after all this time.  Those butterfly constructs on paper wings were best used to solidify the lead, as they&#39;d yet to <em>directly</em> lead them to the next target of the two.  This time, it was a combination of both - the notion of a date and time, and a general area seen with an expanded consciousness, alongside obscure notices about unusual movements generated from the constructs - that had lead Triboulet to the hospital.

She wasn&#39;t going to leave anything to chance this time.  Sanitariums were crowded affairs, and if the Servant or Master really did lay in the building&#39;s wings, they could be anyone.  To find a needle in a haystack is one thing, to find a needle in a haystack that&#39;s covered in sick and white linens was...this metaphor wasn&#39;t perfect, Assassin would admit, but really, it would be easy to blend in.  Fake a cough, get put into bed, and then you&#39;re suddenly that much harder to find.

Assassin came to the hospital&#39;s front door and waited, bound in the invisibility of both her unmanifested form and her concealment.  She waited, hoping to slip in the moment that another left and grant herself that bit of extra deniability, and she got it...from someone running out in a hurry, shock on his face.  Triboulet paid it no heed; the doctors of her time would engage in butchery that made even the strongest man blanche.  She slipped inside...

...and was immediately, <em>immensely</em> disappointed.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117593297020534784 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117593297020534784><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 6:16 PM">6:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>There, standing in the foyer of the hospital, was a man in a coat.  His demeanor was ghoulish enough to be readily discerned from his fine grooming, and in his hands he held a bloodied piercing implement.  This man had already let bodies hit the floor, and in an instant, the matter of who might be the Servant had its field narrowed down with incredible speed.  It could just be a random mad-man who had a suspiciously magical aura about him, but what were the odds?

James heard the mental projection of a forceful groan.

<em>I wish to speak truthfully and honestly, James.  I imagined that this would be an exciting game of cat and mouse, trying to put my brain to use and decide who might be our opponent...he&#39;s standing right there!  Blood coats his hand.  There&#39;s about to be more murders; he&#39;s looking like he&#39;s about to gut that doctor before him,</em> she said, not at all mentioning an attempt to intervene.  <em>Why, oh why, did it have to be so easy?  We&#39;ll never impress our competition with these kind of low-effort searches...</em>

Triboulet remained hidden, watching the ongoing events from a ceiling corner of the waiting room as she braced herself between two walls.  A mixture of disgust, disenfranchisement and disillusionment welled up in her gut.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 6:19 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she took the role of the spearhead, James tailed not too far behind. 

His body still felt the stings of his encounter with the Dowling kid. Thanks to the impressive healing of the ally they made, as well as his own magecraft, James was able to recover enough to go on the hunt again. There was a noticeable limp to his step, though. That wouldn&#39;t be going away for awhile longer. 

<em>&#39;Just be careful, alright, Tri? This could very well be a lure meant to bring us in. Remember, I&#39;m following your lead with this one. Just don&#39;t get me killed, alright?&#39;</em> James made his single plead before he found his way inside of the hospital through the back. Thanks to the panic caused, he had no issues getting in. All he needed to do now was to keep low and listen to Triboulet.

With his trenchcoat lost, James had no way to hide his Silver Nails that were holstered behind his back. His shades were broken too so, with no backups on hand, he did his best to prevent any eye contact from being made with others. Fortunately, he was used to it so it wasn&#39;t too debilitating for him. It was just like riding a bicycle, after all.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117612474947088394 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117612474947088394><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 7:32 PM">7:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With the mana from the patients, H.H possibly recovering from the wounds became a possibility and something that they essentially had to do, and quickly. Even if it was risky, far riskier than Wilt would have done without his back pushed to the wall. A command seal lost, a use of his ace in the hole gone,Their base of operations gone and H.H having lost an arm..though they had at least claimed victory it was a bitter one, which put their chances of winning the war massively down.

Wilt had been silently sitting in the room, plainly watching the events occurring without a word, his eyes lazily gazing towards the amputee and then Dr. Florence in stark contrast to the civilians. It was unfortunate that they had lost the Hotel, but stagnancy would certainly have came to bite them in the back regardless. The Hotel, despite the strategical advanatges that it <em>did</em> carry didn&#39;t mean much against someone with much higher destructive capabilities like Rider. Being on the move would be optimal, with Assasin&#39;s capabilities and his own weakness towards sensory magecraft. But first they&#39;d have to lick their wounds, and where better than a hospital?

His face was donned with a simple surgical mask, though he had been around H.H and was somewhat accustomed to the stench of rot and chemicals he doubted he&#39;d ever fully grow numb to it. More so, it was simply to hide his identity further. 

The young man didn&#39;t look especially different from the rest of the patients there, bandages and the like wrapped tightly around his arms, perhaps once there for the burns but now there to hide the changes which the wedding ring had enacted upon him. Stone replacing flesh and blood.

A decision had to be made, and quickly. The serial killer calmly scanned the room around him, taking note of every single person, camera, and potential exit he could, until the yells of two much larger, rather burly men barreling down the single pair of double doors that lead into the hospital forced him to turn his attention away from the chaos he’d caused. 

The front desk workers were nowhere to be seen - almost certainly cowering out of sight - and were apparently quick to notify security of the ghastly intruder, if not the police as well. 

Assassin paid no heed to the works of the two men, both of whole would stop a good twenty feet from the murderer, tasers in lieu of guns in hand.

They weren’t exactly foolish to believe H. H. a normal man. Apart from the paleness of his figure and ungodly stench, what was there to distinguish him as something truly paranormal? Yet, that would be all he would need.

Despite being called to not move, lest he want a taste of the modern militant torture devices, H. H. would turn to face the two men confronting him. One of the men would begin to pull his taser’s trigger… only to drop it as his head was sent from his neck to the ground. 

The two prongs of the now decapitated man’s partner would come flying towards the bloodied killer, only to be swiped away by H. H. saw in the same motion he’d use to bring it down onto the man’s head, splitting it in twain.

<em>”Excuse me. Make that one-hundred and ninety-eight. In any case, I will take as much life energy as I can get. Otherwise, this might end up being overly taxing for the both of us.”</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>The moment the Master makes themselves known, that&#39;ll be the target,</em> Triboulet said to James, watching dispassionately as one more man met a hideously violent end before her eyes.  More and more, it seemed like she&#39;d never meet a good soul among the Servants of this world.  <em>I will take a shot at him, and if it doesn&#39;t work?  I shall withdraw and try again.

There was a show made of some modern invention of weaponry, a box that produced an arc of lightning within its tiny prongs!  Triboulet would&#39;ve been excited to see it in action, if only for the possibility of making lame electricity-based jokes, but the dullard of a killer denied her that all the same.

With the speed she possessed, if this was anything but an attentive man she was facing she might have succeeded...

...of course, in this moment, any ability she had to hide from the man was gone.  It was no surprise to see that he could turn about and block it at the last moment, a burst of sparks issuing forth as his saw crossed her knife.  He was then face to...not face, as she was a good foot shorter than him, but you get the image.  She looked up, her muscles tensed beneath her brightly colored tights as she strained to keep their weapons in a deadlock, and gave him a smile.

The lack of any smirk or indictor made it difficult over this telepathic link of theirs. Though, to some, failed attempts at humour were funny in their own right to the correct group of people. So, perhaps, it was a joke!

One hand held onto a Silver Nail as he traversed the hospital. If the building was evacuated, for the safety of the others or just generally out of fear, then the only person remaining had to be the master. Right? It was sound logic to James, at least. That much made him feel confident with his criteria of who to poke first.

Though, it wasn&#39;t like he blended in naturally to his surroundings. His weapons and unique eyes were bright red flags to anyone smart enough to notice them! 

But, what was most peculiar about his whole outfit that made him stick out the most wasn&#39;t the sole command spell on his hand; it was the pink bunny secured tightly to his belt. Each step caused it to bounce slightly. Without the trench coat, there was nothing hiding the location of his most sacred tool. 

Sure, one could say that bringing along Mister Fluffybuns to an actual warzone was tempting fate with its safety. And they would be right! However! Mister Fluffybuns knew of the occupational hazards that came with coming along. That and he couldn&#39;t risk it now after someone very clearly broke into their shop while they were away.

For now, the doll simply hung and bounced around while keeping a watchful eye behind James. <s>To no actual effect, of course.</s></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1120717108528029727 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1120717108528029727><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 20, 2023 9:09 AM">9:09 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="tunaguy">@Tuna-wik</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="jimmythejohn">@6 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="kasualtee">@Illinois-chan</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;A few extra wouldn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;d be a shame to leave it on a number like that anyways.&quot;

Wilt&#39;s eyes wearily travelled across the room from the guard, or so he assumed-vague memories of a taser being all that remained, to the clashing of metal on metal. A very unfortunate outcome indeed. The Jester&#39;s appearance and weapon didn&#39;t seem to inspire any sort of name to Wilt, a small click of his tongue leaving his mouth

A servant able to elude Assassin was a curious sight. Perhaps they had some degree of presence concealment? Direct combat in any case was a poor outcome, perhaps it&#39;d be safer to disengage until they had properly recovered? No...even with the various patients there was no telling if H.H would be able to properly convert them into mana while engaged and an arm down.

The bandaged boy began to scan the room, looking for any sort of vantage that he could...when his eyes began to be drawn towards James. Anybody choosing to simply walk in while this was happening had to be crazy, especially with a limp such as that-he certainly wouldn&#39;t be able to leave easily...or more than likely the master of the strange jester. His eyes...and the needles that were haphazardly strapped to him, did he want people to know that he was a master? The bright rabbit like paraphernalia gave him pause, unable to piece together the significance of it, perhaps a familiar? He had to be weary of Mister Fluffybuns, that much was obvious.

Almost instantaneously, the serial killer’s telepathic conversation with his Master would be severed by the knife of a small woman.

Deflecting the blade of the small, costume-clad blonde came to H. H. almost instinctively, the man still wary from his clash with the… resurrected… Rider. She was fast, could hide her presence, and almost certainly a weakling. 

“Not at all madame. Or, should I say, Assassin?”

I’m the midst of speaking, H. H. would throw a push kick at his fellow Assassin’s torso, hoping to give himself a bit of distance to make his next move. He’d deal with her, but the priority was bodies. 

“What need is there for me to relieve myself when I’m to be entertained by a foul-mouthed floozy?”

With a crazy smile, the one-armed man would make a break for the main entrance/exit doors of the waiting room, where something of a crush had begun to happen as a result of one too many souls hoping to escape while the man was distracted.

If nothing was done, more heads were going to role in the next moment than words could be spoken.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

And a--OOF&quot;

Her back bent at an unpleasant angle, a boot to her chest pushing her away and freeing their locked blades.  Triboulet turned this from a blunder - having been deprived of her undoubtedly hilarious joke - into a proper backflip, coming to rest on a three point landing.  She looked up, perturbed.  &quot;You&#39;ve got a terrible sense of timing, my friend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not here to entertain you, for I fear that no one is entertained by a comedienne as useless as I am.  What I can promise thee, instead,&quot; she bowed a little to him, &quot;is relief from the vagaries of life.  To forget your worries, and no longer have to d--HEY!&quot;  H.H. didn&#39;t bother waiting for her full speech, instead making a run for the crowd!  What did she <em>just</em> say about timing?!  The absolute nerve...

Turning his back to her could&#39;ve been a terrible fault, and a baffling one when faced with a professional backstabber such as her, but it wasn&#39;t to be taken full advantage of.  He&#39;d be able to run up, throw his arm in the air with murderous abandon, and be all but prepared to take his hand down to cut into the back of the screaming woman before him...

...and he&#39;d suddenly feel his vision tilt and invert.  The culprit: the most basic gag possible.  The banana peel.

Triboulet had taken that little stick-with-a-head that she calls a scepter and changed it into a fruit rind, and then tossed it underneath his foot with expert precision (for someone who&#39;s never thrown a banana peel before)!  A stupid tactic, yes, but infalliable in its classic nature.  Were he only a little less eager to run in and murder innocents, maybe he wouldn&#39;t be slipping, now would he?

Running up behind him to capitalize on it, Triboulet threw herself at the madman from the side, launching into a dropkick with the intent of keeping him as far away as possible from the front door as she could.  Naturally, she had a shitty joke to follow this with: &quot;Slipping up already!  Shameful!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There, while his sights were avoiding the direct gaze of others, something stood out among the rest. 

A man. 

There was no sense of terror in his movements. No fear nor panic. Not like the rest of the crowd. 

This man saw how someone, even on the edge of death, fought to preserve his life. How hard they fought despite the wounds placed upon them. This unassuming, bandaged man had none of that. It was a shot in the dark but the pain still felt throughout his body from his engagement with Lachlan reminded him why being overcautious is better than being careless.

But if he was wrong...

&#39;<em>I think I found him...</em>&#39; James spoke to Assassin through their link before turning to close the distance between his target with each limping step.

He couldn&#39;t allow himself to focus on the skirmish between the servants, such a thing would assuredly give away his one and frankly only plan.

Then the nail began to glow shine.

Wilt had some sand on him, naturally, but such a weapon could likely pierce through any sort of defense he could muster. Could he even take on a master in his state? 

No, the man had every advantage as it was. He couldn&#39;t let him get the first move. 

In a moment, a small blade made of sand would form in his hand- reaching down no longer than his forearm and he swung it-taking a lunge forward.

He was well out of reach of the attack possibly hitting, as though he was mearly aiming at the air itself, and would likely leave himself open for a counter attack. Then the blade began to shift radically, in a moment it shot out towards the Dreamer&#39;s chest like that of a thin spear, aiming to stop the momentuem of the swing by imbedding itself inside. It was a cheap tactic, but it played upon the assumption that his opponent was far more experienced than him, and their senses keen enough to realize that the blade would never reach them as it was.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He’s been expecting to be attacked one more by little Assassin… but with a banana peel? 

Initially, it would appear as if her comical trap was going to have H. H. flat on his back. His oversized saw would go flying out of his grip and into the air above him in a similarly comical fashion, furthering the idea that Assassin’s gamble with her scepter had worked as intended.

Yet, at the same time, all of his power would go into forcing his body to turn midair, in rather cat-like fashion. He wasn’t a human at this point. He hadn’t been a human for a long, long time. And - unlike a human - he had the reflexes, speed, and strength to react to Triboulet’s actions in a way a living person never could. To the serial killer’s surprise, the minuscule jester had decided to go on the offense by basically tossing herself at him.

A poorly though-out move, given her apparent weakness and lack of knowledge concerning her opponent’s physicality. 

The moment Assassin (F)’s kick would meet Assassin (M), H. H. would lock his newly freed arm around one of her legs. Then, with the momentum of her own strike, H. H. would continue to twist, using his opponent’s own velocity against her as he misdirected the attack, letting go at the apex of the throw in order to fling her across the room- where she’d intended the serial killer to end up instead.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1124438093303382136 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1124438093303382136><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 30, 2023 3:35 PM">3:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Unfortunately for H.

The true disaster here.

Instead, she rolled off, somersaulting from the ground and bouncing back into place with a call of &quot;And that shall be the last slip-up allotted to thee!&quot;

How splendid, her opponent hadn&#39;t even had the competence to get back on his feet after this meager strike!  She was going to be done with this killing before the end of the day at this rate.  Holmes was given ample time to move himself back into position as Triboulet had opted to lollygag, standing...no...<em>preparing.</em>  Her hands were held in a strange position, braced to the side, and she spoke dread words.

&quot;This will be your curtain call...face this, my Noble Phantasm: 「Shatter, O--&quot;

While Triboulet would&#39;ve adored the opportunity to finish this joke, it too was robbed of her - James called her along, providing a much more proper target.  Really, it would&#39;ve been just <em>hilarious</em> to make up a fake Noble Phantasm on the spot and then just kick him in the nuts, but being Triboulet was an exercise in pain.  Triboulet paused for a moment, eyes wide and frozen in a stupid-looking pose, before she...simply ran away.

And, no, by the looks of things and by Holmes&#39; supernatural senses, she wasn&#39;t just feinting.  She really had fled.  It wouldn&#39;t be a major stretch to guess what she really was doing, of course, but even that would be her downfall.

Another one rushed into the fray and changed the outcome drastically. Both weapons were knocked away, one by force and the other by reflex. James&#39; heart sunk for a moment before he saw who&#39;s the third blade belonged too; it was his Servant. 

Just how many injuries could he have avoided if they just fought like this from the beginning. This man was truly foolish indeed.

&quot;Kill him, Assassin!&quot; The man shouted while he took a step back to remain on guard. &#39;<em>Seal the deal, Tri.</em>&#39; While he spoke to hide her true name, he made sure to make up for it by calling out to her by her nickname that he appointed her with.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The Injury would be enough to end this here, changing the form of the spear while it was inside would certainly kill the older man, tearing through muscle and nerves-even if he couldn&#39;t get a deep wound. But the blade would never meet the flesh, as the strange Jester interfered. Dying here would be a pathetic way to go, but where was his Servant? He had to buy him time, whether to recover or to prepare the last of the mana needed.

The knife would shatter at the point it was deflected, in part due to how frail it had become in it&#39;s stilleto like state and in part due to the mana rapidly leaving the blade. He couldn&#39;t do much with it in this form, so with a simple change once more, it seemed to fling itself, using the momentum of both the swing and the displacement to create a sort of fine cloud to attempt to blind the Jester. It wouldn&#39;t do much, but he doubted that the servant was especially trained in combat-much less fighting blind.

Wilt would stumble back away from the two of them. His eyes wide and his teeth grit, the injuries from before hadn&#39;t faded so running was completely out of the question-he doubted he could even dodge the advances of one adversary either-much less two. His time was running out, and quickly as he backed up towards the wall.

<em>&quot;Hurry.&quot;</em> A quick and immediate command was sent to his servant through their connection. H.H had to come through, less their chances to obtain the grail completely fade away in this damned hospital.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In return for being shown so many faces of fear… his own expression would not change whatsoever. 

He was a mere couple yards/meters from securing victory. But, until that time came, there was room for neither boasting, nor even excitement. The pain he felt throughout his body… the phantom pain of an arm burned to ash… it was a reminder of the risk that came with prolonging a fight with another Servant. 

No pomp and circumstance was needed here. It was time to bring things to an end.

Raising his remaining weapon into the air, H. H. would give himself the power he needed to cleave through as many fleeing future corpses as possible, regardless of the effect it would have on Wilt’s strength and well-being.

“With your sacrifice, let my legend grasp the hearts and minds of men with fear once more. 「Tools of--! …No. <strong>「Tool of Desecration」</strong>!”

Through the screams, there was silence. Through the silence, the serial killer would catch on to the motion behind him. He would turn his head to look over his shoulder, allowing a mass of black ooze to drip from the tip of his weapon as he continued to hold it up in the air, causing a hole to be melted into the floor with a strangely satisfying sizzle.

There would be no reaction from the serial killer as his opponent began a mock True Name release for her supposed Noble Phantasm, only a sharp, silent glare. Just like that, she would cut the release short, opting to make a break towards the Masters’ side of things instead.

Going after Wilt, was she? Hmph, not that it mattered. In fact, should that be the case-

One body would fall, now missing a head.

A second body would fall, having been bisected diagonally from collarbone to opposite ribcage.

A third body would fall, thoroughly disemboweled.

A fourth person would go down, having had his legs taken off. A scream of pain unlike any other would erupt from the elderly man’s mouth… only for it to end moments later as his flesh and blood quickly carbonized before sloughing off, leaving nothing but a skeleton that would disappear in mere moments. The same would occur seconds later with those rendered dead or mortally wounded by H. H.’s Noble Phantasm. One moment, they were living. The next, their bodies had ceased to exist.

<em>”It is time. That being said, if you would- *

Inhale. Exhale. It wasn’t that he needed to breathe, but… it wasn’t as if he enjoyed the smell of his lair either. He was simply used to it.

“To all of you within this room… to those that nearly escaped… to the bystanders unaware of the horrors they are about to face… to my Master, and our fellow sinners… Let it be known, that you are <em>all</em> invited!”

Triboulet coughed, fine particulate doing as much to choke as blind, and Mr. Losfeld&#39;s life was extended by a moment.

She was at a brief disadvantage, her head pointed down as she tried to blink away what was there - but she wasn&#39;t wholly blind, either.  The enemy Master was still a locus of mana, and he had just expended a good deal of it.  To find him without eyes would be a matter of filtering out the expended energy in the air and seeking its source.

James gave her the order to kill, and eyes still clouded, she nodded.  Wilt was still detectable, and his retreating steps were also plain as day.  The only distraction was a voice in the distance, so there was nothing left but to make it a done deal.

&quot;<em>Au revoir,</em> but at the same time, I sincerely hope you don&#39;t.&quot;

She flashed a bright smile of contempt and came at him, knife held in both hands to plunge deep into his chest--

Triboulet, still blind, reacted quickly and stabbed Wilt a few more times.  Thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk.  How odd, the man must&#39;ve had some wooden armor underneath those bandages.

She blinked away the debris in her eyes and found that &quot;Wilt&quot; was just a wall - yellowed, aged wallpaper, a thick grime of something foul-smelling and deep-set.  Several thick puncture marks from her knife were included.  She turned around.

James was there, but the rest of the hallway they were in had disappeared.  Indeed, now where there was a hospital, a completely different building sat in its place.  The whole room appeared...slanted, intentionally so.  The lines of its construction would be ordered and parallel in any normal place, but here, there was a sense that every line that could skew off in its own direction, just slightly, would do so.  There was a window that had nothing behind it besides bricks, and the door was placed above themselves, in the ceiling.

As well, there was a thick grey fog...smoke?  Triboulet couldn&#39;t identify it at first scent, but additional sniffs brought it closer to mind - and the wracking cough, exacerbated by her earlier issues, made it clear that this acrid fume was harmful.  She controlled herself, blinked further to clear her vision...

&quot;...I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve somehow gotten us lost.&quot;  She forced a smile as she fought down the coughing fit.  &quot;So incompetent that me and my knife have ended up elsewhere entirely!  Forgive this useless Servant, James.&quot;

Exhaling deeply, she kept her body from coughing by force, and her breathing came to a controlled pace.  It still burned her lungs, however, just...manageably.  Her head came upward, and she went to work immediately.  Triboulet lept upward, reaching the ceiling-suspended door with ease and grabbing the doorknob - it opened into a dim passage, leading who knows where.  But where else was there to go?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127026338302271628 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127026338302271628><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 7, 2023 7:00 PM">7:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She dropped down to the floor and repositioned herself, kneeling down and holding her hands out in front of her.  &quot;I&#39;ll let myself be stairs, much more fitting, aye?

The sight of the much smaller lady trying to give a boost to a stately man like Mr. Rellum was a strange one, but at least there was no one else around to notice.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There wasn&#39;t any possible way that they could avoid certain death in the condition they were in. That was what he thought before a bright light stole the sight of his surroundings. Did they mess up somehow? Was their another pair who caught both of them off guard? None of those questions were answered. Even more questions came up once their surroundings were brought into view once more.

&quot;...What just happened?&quot; The confusion was painfully clear on his face. From the looks of the place, he was sure that they must have landed in Purgatory. It was the only place that made sense in his mind with how the location looked like, after all.

There wasn&#39;t enough time to worry about it, though. The coughing fits, which started off simple, became harsh. James&#39; vision blurred which caused him to stumble up against a wall for support before he continued to cough out the rest of his lungs with how his coughs sounded like. The pain had his eyes watering. Whatever this place was, they couldn&#39;t avoid to stay for long.

&quot;Hey, first attempt is always a wash, right? Or something like that.&quot; Even with his lungs burning, James did his best to play off of Triboulet to ensure that her Noble Phantasm stayed active, seeing how he was the only one here. A hand was placed slightly over his mouth before his circuits activated. The cheap spell he casted wouldn&#39;t neutralize the poisonous air completely, but it would buy him more time before it could claim his life.

She found a starting point for them! It wasn&#39;t much, nor did it guaranteed their survival, but it was something.

James immediately doubted his ability to mimic what she did to reach the same point up there, especially on a still-limping leg. Though, her request to help him up relieved him of that issue. 

&quot;Just don&#39;t break your own neck trying to lift me up, alright? I don&#39;t think I could carry you around like you did for me if it came down to that.&quot; With the grace of a potted plant, James was able to use the boost granted by his Servant to reach the door and get up until he could roll his body over. The reminders of the wounds he accumulated so far flared up which brought out a groan.

To lift James up was trivial in the matter of strength; even her weak self could&#39;ve thrown him about like a wet rag.  However, with his feet alone being that much larger than her hands and the imbalance of size being an issue, she briefly teetered him backward, threatening to drop him.  A quick push forward got him stable enough to grab the edge of the doorframe, and Triboulet lifting him up the rest of the way got him out of this room.

The next place was dark, a narrow hall that required James to crouch to keep moving through.  Triboulet had no such issue, and the moment she leapt up after him, she took point.

&quot;Now,&quot; she said, keeping her voice low, &quot;if my paranoia is right, we must be under watch...this has to be a Bounded Field of some kind, maybe a Reality Marble...but he doesn&#39;t seem <em>that</em> competent, does he?  Only skilled in the field of moustache care.&quot;  What a strange man, that killer was.  &quot;To be safe, keep our secrets to ourselves.&quot;

The hallway came about at a bend, lit dimly from an uncertain source - to go around the other way seemed to drop off into a dark pit that ended even more uncertainly, so there was no real choice in the matter.  Triboulet kept talking as she crept forward at an even, measured pace.

&quot;And this poison...the only thing more noxious than its creator.  Can&#39;t dawdle for too long, or--&quot;

Looking over her shoulder, James could see Triboulet&#39;s hand snap up in front of her face between blinks.  She stopped dead in her tracks, and her breath seized...she turned to face him.  In her fist was a thin needle, only visible as a just-there gleam, at least a foot long.  She had caught it before it could strike her, and from the looks of it, she only intercepted it with a mere couple of inches remaining.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128133785637105754 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128133785637105754><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 8:20 PM">8:20 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She looked up at him with wide eyes...and then chuckled a little.  &quot;<em>Classique!</em>  The old hidden dart in the wall trick, there could be no greater trap in--&quot;

Triboulet&#39;s other hand snapped up behind her head.  She had stepped backward, and apparently, triggered a second instance of the same trap.  This time, the dart was close enough to brush against her hair as it quivered in her tense grip.

&quot;...Ahhh...&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;I&#39;ve been defeated!  I can&#39;t keep up the amusement if I&#39;ve got to keep so focused...let&#39;s just walk into our deaths with our dignity intact.&quot;

Triboulet didn&#39;t back up her words with action.  The rest of the passage was taken even slower, and from there, another three almost soundless darts came from the walls by the end - she had the agility to take these on without outside distraction, but strangely, she was silent.  The closest she came to a joke was an impatient tap of the foot as she expected a sixth, but she didn&#39;t make a single jest by the end.  Did she know she was putting her life, paradoxically, at more risk?</span></div></div></div></div></div>
