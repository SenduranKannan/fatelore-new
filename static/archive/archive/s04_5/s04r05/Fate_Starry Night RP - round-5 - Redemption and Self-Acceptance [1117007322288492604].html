But despite what these various footsteps on the sand might have said, the beach itself was deserted, not a single soul in view. Not surprising, given the countless murders that have taken place around those waters since the beginning of the Holy Grail War. As a matter of fact, the entire bay area around Aswan was considered dangerous and off-limits, but that didn&#39;t stop Ann from trespassing and bringing Prince with her by the skin of his pale neck.

Speaking of which, Prince had been skittish for some time. Perhaps he was just now feeling the weight and pressure of facing himself, Ann thought... but it had to be done. Just as he started to look a little too upset and unsure of himself, Ann walked up beside him and put her arm around his neck, pulling him forward with every step she took.

&quot;We&#39;re almost there, Prince. Don&#39;t chicken out.&quot; Ann ordered with a severe look on her face, tightening the grip she had around his neck so he wouldn&#39;t go anywhere.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though it made walking a bit more challenging, his hair getting snagged on her clothes and causing him some mild discomfort, it was a good sort of pain. The type of frozen fingers prickling from the sting of heat. A pain that was the result of healing, of torn down walls, an intimacy between comrades; friends even.
The fact that he no longer minded Ann’s rough treatment of him was a sign that he… started to tolerate her. Yes. That was certainly the word he would have chosen, and no other.

Regardless, even he could tell that this had been her attempt at cheering him up and dispel his gloom, and so who was he to discard the fruit of her efforts?

“Not like you have ever been nervous about anything in your entire life. The sky could fall and crush us, and you would still be able to find the time to smoke one of those stinking cigarettes of yours without a care in the world.”

He spoke with noticeably lighter shoulders, the tension that had plagued him all day gradually melting away. Though naturally he could not give Ann the pleasure of realizing the effect she had on him, hence his hurried remark meant as an attempt to distract her.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

You can&#39;t worry about every damn thing in life or your hair will turn white. See?&quot;

She buried the fingers of her hooked arm between the silky locks on Prince&#39;s head, playfully ruffling them until his bangs began to fall and block his pale blue dots.

Now that they&#39;d made it this far without Prince running away with his tail between his legs, Ann couldn&#39;t help but feel a jolt of pride swell in her chest... not unlike a mother seeing her child stand up for himself, she supposed. After all, how could she not? He had come a long way from his former ways after all. Self-pity and regret used to tear him down from the inside out, but fortunately, he wasn&#39;t impervious to change…

Or at least that&#39;s what Ann wanted to believe, but in the end, it was up to him to take the step. The two of them walked to the edge of the beach, the unruly waves of the calm ocean tickling the tips of their shoes as the rising sun bathed their faces and the horizon in a warm orange glow.

&quot;So,&quot; She lit the tip of the cigarette with her lighter and craned her neck towards Prince. As was often the case, Ann&#39;s expression fell back into a laconic lassitude, bordering on disinterest. Of course, she was anything but that, but looking like that might put the worried Prince in a more casual mood... or so she liked to believe. &quot;On a scale of one to ten, how bad do you feel when you look into the sea where you ate dozens of people? And when I say you, I mean you in a completely different body, with a mind that responds to impulses and instincts beyond your control&quot;.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He shook his hair after Ann released him, undoing the ruffled mess she left behind, and casually kicked off his shoes to the side before heading deeper into the shoreline, submerging himself up to his ankles in the ebb and flow of the Nile’s current. Drinking in the scenery of the yawning sun cresting over the horizon, Ann eventually broke the silence with an oddly factual recounting of the exact issue plaguing him.

“That’s one way to put it…” he sighed, wrinkling his nose at the sharp stench of smoke and breathing out heavily to keep it from reaching his lungs; the fresh breeze kept the worst of it at bay though.

“But I don’t know,” he ultimately admitted, his eyes fixated on the river’s shifting reflections, failing to spot any signs of the carnage that had ravaged these past few weeks, “One? Eleven perhaps?”

“It is hard to feel bad about the things you did in a dream. You don’t feel guilty for reading a sad story in a picture book, don’t feel responsible for the things that happened before you were born, but it is different if you know that the stories are real. If they are about you.
You know that you should feel bad and regret the things that happened, because if you don’t…

“A beast sees things a bit differently from humans after all. What they like, what they hate, what brings them joy and what brings them pain, all of these things aren’t all that different. If something smells nice, you want to treasure it, if something hurts you, you want to stop it, and you do that by killing it. Probably eat it too.
It is no different from how humans treat flowers and animals. A cigarette or a movie.
By wanting to keep it close or keep it away, you are effectively doing the same thing.

“So it’s not that I don’t understand. The problem is that I do… because I think not understanding and agreeing with what a monster feels like is supposed to be normal for humans.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was an ugly truth to face, but Christopher had to realize it sooner or later. He had simply chosen the latter. Marcus had been weak.

His former master&#39;s intention were noble, there was no doubt about that; of all the wishes one could make, curing a disease was definitely one of the more selfless. But even so, the methods to get there were too grossly self-absorbed. The disease was not the same that took his loved one...it was the disease of longing for someone. Even if it meant no one else had to die by one method, the war did not justify the abuse of this city. And so, Christopher had made the choice in the dead of night, when his master could not stop him. He left. 

For if there is one job a saint must uphold, it&#39;s to show the path of light and righteousness. Beauty in the caring of the weak. He had not been blind to the suffering; there was a monster in this war. One that sank countless lives alone, all by the river front. How fortunate then that this war brought with it a guardian of the river. 

He had spent the past 16 hours by the beachside, carefully watching for any signs of the creature once more, both on the shore and within the waters. He had thought to himself a beast must find itself at a loss of options when it runs out of food, and so he thought to try and ensnare it when it made the effort to breach in its search for sustenance. But what he couldn&#39;t have expected as he was stationed out here was a confession. 

&quot;That&#39;s all very touching.&quot; 

The soft shifting of sand beneath his feet signaled Lancer&#39;s presence. What he had thought might be simply trespassing teenagers became his purpose in this war. If he could not serve a worthy and strong master, he was to make sure another did not claim a wish. The lapping of the waves seemed to echo back against the growl building in Lancer&#39;s throat as the final wisps of his spiritual form faded in the low winds.

Uh, I see.&quot; She nodded to herself as she looked into Prince&#39;s back, not really seeing most of what Prince had just sprouted, but still making a thoughtful and profound expression. &quot;So, by understanding the beast you once were, you think it makes you less of a human... did I get that right?&quot;

What an oversimplification! Ann was no philosopher, that much was clear. And she was certainly not the type to dwell on questions of morality, ethics and other such <em>boring</em> matters. It just wasn&#39;t her thing... but that didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t think rationally, either. She inhaled into her cigarette as deeply as she could, holding her breath until it hurt as she picked out the right words in her head, then let the smoke slowly fizzle out of her mouth before breaking the silence.

&quot;What&#39;s so cool about being a boring human, anyway? You can turn into a dope dragon that breathes ice.&quot; She held up a finger. &quot;You can slough off your dragon skin and become a normal guy who&#39;s got looks for days.&quot; She held up another finger. &quot;You&#39;ll never have to worry about money again.&quot; She held a third. &quot;Aaa~nd you can wish anything into existence.&quot; She held a fourth.

&quot;That&#39;s like four whole reasons why you <em>don&#39;t</em> want to be a human! What&#39;s so wrong with accepting yourself and...&quot;

Ann&#39;s eyes widened as her attempt at rationality was cut short by the invisible figure speaking over her. The water at her feet splashed violently as she twisted her ankles and turned to face the unwelcome guest, who slowly revealed himself to be a rather... large human with a dog&#39;s head. No, not just large. He was <em>gigantic</em>.

Roaring like weighty thunder, coming from an absolute titan of a bass guitar. Its strings, taut and thick, seemed to possess an almost gravitational force, drawing sound waves from the depths of the earth. The rhythm, though slow, was never ending and never changing. Still as a monolith. Commanding attention, leaving an indelible mark on the sonic landscape, the one constant of the entire universe.

That was the kind of Servant she was looking at. Once again, she was reminded of the reality she was in: this was a Holy Grail War, and enemies lurked around every corner. She only wished the dog-man had chosen a better time to show himself. She spat out her cigarette butt and straightened her posture, looking up at the dog-man&#39;s head with a fiery stare.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with that face?&quot; She asked, diffusing the tension that had begun to build from Christopher&#39;s violent declaration of intent with a funny expression. &quot;What are you, some kind of furry? And what&#39;s with wanting to crack people&#39;s skulls open... is that a bit? Are we on tape?&quot;

She feigned ignorance, hoping it would at least buy them time until Prince could think of something, <em>anything</em>, to get them out of here quickly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<strong>THUD</strong>

Sand flew from the impact of his staff as Christopher brought the log down, glaring deep into Ann&#39;s eyes before slowly looking over to the Prince. It was practically a confession...they had laid it out cleanly. THIS was the monster that had taken so many lives. While yes, there were other Servants that might cause trouble, the gunslinger coming to mind first and foremost, this was one such Servant that had already caused bouts of anguish in this war. They had the potential to cause more. Did she not call them a dragon? And what is a dragon to a saint? But another challenge to overcome, a chance to prove their devotion. 

&quot;I&#39;m not in the mood for games, girl. I heard tell all through this war that there was a beast gorging itself on the people of this city. This city is supposed to be a respite for its citizens, but do you know all that they&#39;ve suffered since this war&#39;s commencement? It&#39;s become corrupted. All because there are monsters lurking throughout. So, as a Saint, it&#39;s my duty to be honest and swift. I am going to kill the beasts. You can either step aside, or I can force you aside, but this is an inevitability. <strong>Move.</strong>&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1117621214874189844 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1117621214874189844><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 11, 2023 8:07 PM">8:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

So his goal wasn&#39;t to hunt down any Master or Servant. He was after Lindwyrm specifically, and miraculously, he found himself in exactly the right place at exactly the right time to find the prince. How lucky for him, and how terribly unlucky for them.

&quot;Must be nice, eavesdropping on people and carefully picking out the words you want to hear.&quot; The water splashed as she took a few steps and placed herself between him and her Servant. &quot;Did you forget the part where I said he couldn&#39;t control himself when he was a dragon? I&#39;ll say it again: he couldn&#39;t control himself when he was a dragon. The beast you&#39;re talking about no longer exists, it&#39;s already been killed days ago!&quot;

Prince didn&#39;t do anything. She couldn&#39;t see him behind her as she followed the Saint&#39;s increasingly annoyed gaze, but she figured he might have been too stunned or surprised to do anything in this situation, which meant it was up to her to make the first move. She took a long breath and put her hands behind her back...

And immediately, the seals on her right hand began to glow a bright red, with a faint fizzling accompanying the oppressive light. She could feel the energy morphing and coalescing into a single point of power, just waiting for the right words to be unleashed:

&quot;I command you, Prince...&quot; she murmured, taking a step back. &quot;Summon a boat fast enough to outrun this dickwad!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He had no words, as the sudden shift in mood and threat was much too steep, and was fortunate that his Master at least kept a cool head on her shoulders, already working on a way to get them out of this situation. As she stepped between him and the new arrival, he too retreated by a few paces out of self-preservatory instinct, gradually adding distance between them and their self-proclaimed executor inch by inch, until-

The unleashed torrent of an invoked Command Seal washed over him, stretching and tearing at the core that lay deep in his chest to ask for a wish it ordinarily lacked the capacity to grant.

“Ehhhhh!?”

Not that he could stop it now that the process had begun, even despite his surprise at the sudden turn of events.

The air around him grew heavy, exerting an electrifying pressure akin to static electricity, ripples forming on the water and being pushed aside from the swelling weight of the magical energy processed by his body, leaving behind a faint silvery glimmer on his skin. It all only took a second. One moment a hazy outline imprinted itself into the space next to himself and Ann, and before one could even blink, something outrageous manifested out of thin air.

With a loud splash, a massive boat crashed into the riverside, but not just any random model.
Ann had demanded speed, and ever helpful wish-granting White Rose within Prince had answered.

It… did not look like an ordinary boat, but that was only to be expected, seeing as it was custom made.

The Spirit of Australia.
A wooden speed boat build by Ken Warby in his backyard, one powered by a genuine Westinghouse J34 Jet Engine meant for Jet Fighters which allowed it to reach speeds of upwards to 500 km/h, peaking at 529 km/h in 1978 when Warby set the Water Speed World Record.

It was a monster of human ingenuity, and the weight of its impact on the beach caused the water and sand by Prince’s feet to be violently catapulted into the air. Shocked by this unbelievable turn of events, it was only to be expected that he lost his footing and fell onto the ship’s hull, only then realizing that by nature of Ann’s wish to ‘get away’, the jet engine was naturally pointed directly at the enemy Servant to provide for the fastest and most direct way to get out of there. Which was without a doubt-

“...insane! What kind of crazy boat did you wish for, Ann!? Do you even know you to-”

<em>“Oh no.”</em>

The realization of what Ann was about to do stopped the words in his throat.
She wasn’t…
No. That would be crazy.
Surely she didn’t know how to control this thing.
Or worse.
What if she didn’t… but decided to try anyway?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A flash of red. Command seal. The sting of it he knew well as the Prince heeded their Master&#39;s command. 

&quot;Wait, what the hell are you-&quot; 

A monolith of human ingenuity, or human garrishness, popped in a display of Mystic apparition and swirling riverwater. It&#39;s massive hull eclipsed Lancer&#39;s view of the surrounding island opposite the river&#39;s shore, a wake rippling from its backside as if to mock Lancer&#39;s mission with a sudden escape.

&quot;Oh damn it, are you kidding me, you think it&#39;s going to be that easy?!&quot; 

Lancer dashed forward with his Staff in tow, aiming to bypass Ann and attack the Prince directly before they could board. Lancer was quick, but he was doubting he&#39;d be able to keep up with this machination, meaning this had to end quickly. His weapon swung above his head, it&#39;s club blocking out the early morning light as it left a shadow on the Prince&#39;s brow, signaling its destination across his scalp, Lancer&#39;s eyes trained on the boyish face with no trace of guilt for what he was about to smash.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1118045759212888064 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1118045759212888064><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 13, 2023 12:14 AM">12:14 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="Deleted User">@Deleted User</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="spiritssss">@Spirits</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ann had hoped for something small and nimble, like a jet ski or something. Not a massive ship that looked more like an airplane than a boat!

Christopher used the chaos caused by the ship&#39;s sudden appearance as a window to strike, blowing past Ann as if she didn&#39;t exist. It was obvious why he was doing this: his target was and had always been Prince.

She barely had time to catch her balance, turn and bark out the word &quot;Dodge!&quot; before Christopher&#39;s blow made contact with his head, crossing her fingers that her feminine command would move Prince&#39;s body faster than he could have on his own.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ann’s words rang loud and true, spurring on Prince’s own survival instinct and forcing him into action.

The deck of the ship had already been soaked in water, thus making its entire surface wet and slippery. With nary thought to spare, he kicked the nearest surface as hard as he could to shove himself off into the exact opposite direction, sliding off the pristine white boat’s smooth surface in an effort to evade the blow that would surely spell his death, yet before he plummeted gracelessly into the water, a short phrase escaped his lips.

“Rose, my wish-!”

His words were drowned out by the loud splash caused by the impact against the river’s surface, but the wish had been made, and the wish-granter answered. Manifesting simply what first came to mind, out of nowhere, a wheelbarrow suddenly appeared before Christopher’s vision, intercepting the arc of his swing and momentarily obscuring Prince from his sight. Not that such a paltry defense would offer much resistance at all against a Servant of nigh unparalleled strength, but it nevertheless served to buy Prince just enough time to escape his certain death. For now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A wheelbarrow was there, only to turn into a shower of slivers and splinters that rained down around the wolfed visage of Christopher, his form hunched and his cloak ruffling around his shoulders as the fibrous planks bounced from his mighty shoulders. The grip of his staff tightened with the impact against the sand, and the Saint turned his eyes to the water, flitting across the surface for a chance to see where the Prince would rise from. A growl slowly rippled from his chest and broke through his throat, his shoulders shaking as he turned to the boat. His chest rose and fell with shuddering breaths as the hair on his nape stood on end. Was it the numerous times of being made a fool of? Was it the defiance of his purpose in this grail war? Was he not meant to avenge the fallen, or to give guidance to those who lost their souls? 

Perhaps. He only knew that he was <strong>fucking pissed.</strong>

&quot;I could search every inch of this river until I found you, beast...but as your master might already have picked up on, I&#39;m on borrowed time. This is what I&#39;m meant to do...don&#39;t delay this! FACE YOUR SINS!&quot; 

The whites of his eyes eclipsed the dots of his pupils, his mind waning with it as Christopher grabbed the hull of the ship and <em>lifted.</em> His muscles bulged through his armor and a roar clawed from his jaws before they clamped shut and the yawn of creaking metal replaced it. The river came with it, dripping from the sleek bow of the ship. Good lord, the bow of the ship was above the water. But not for long, as Christopher arched forward and brought the machine back to the surface, aiming to slam into the Prince beneath the waves or send him further below to drown.

Could this mean that he had already succumbed to a glancing blow, rendering the Saint’s brutal judgment unnecessary? Either way, it would not stop Christopher from bringing the boat down regardless, something Prince was well aware of, and thus he decided on another risky gamble. After all, when faced with such a monster of a Servant in battle, he could not hope for much else than to buy himself precious few seconds of survival at a time, the notion of victory a cruel joke.

The water’s surface lit up dimly once more, marking the evocation of his unique ability, and it didn’t take long for his aim to come clear. 

The ground beneath Christopher’s feet shifted, or rather, only is left foot, as out of nowhere an old rusted water cylinder appeared half-buried directly underneath him, greatly upsetting his stable footing as his left side was lifted by a considerable amount, only for his heel to puncture the worn-out metal the very next second. The cylinder was in terrible shape, seemingly neglected and forgotten for years, which meant that it was ill-suited to support the weight of a battle-hardened Servant currently in the process of lifting an giant boat, and its appearance within the shore had forced the sand to be displaced, not enough to alter the landscape, but shifting the ground just enough to make it all the more likely for those standing upon it to trip, though naturally that would be without factoring in a warrior’s extensive experience and bodily control.

“What do you mean ‘face my sins’! What do you think I’ve been trying to do, you… you big idiot!”

Venting his own uncertainty and confusion at his assailant, the Rose in his chest answered, causing one sandbag after another to be flung against the wolf-man’ face, <s>annoying</s> ineffective as they may be.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a slight adjustment, but enough of one that when the ship crashed back against the water, he, too, crashed on his back against the sand and felt the impact of his own weight as the breath was knocked out of him for a split moment. 

He raised himself, brow furrowed more in confusion than in any lasting injury. He could create ships, but then just wasted water drums the next? He didn&#39;t get to ponder the subject to deeply, what with the sudden impact of a sandbag directly to his face. It was a mild sting at best, but still a sting. Even if you can withstand a mosquito bite doesn&#39;t make it any less troublesome.

&quot;I think-&quot; WHUMPH

Another bag blasted him, several now slamming into his visage and digging granules into his eyes as he tried to at least get some retort out. But much like an argument with the child, it was hard to get a word in edgewise with such a stream of garbage being flung. 

&quot;I think-<strong>whump</strong> I THINK <strong>whump</strong>

&quot;WOULD YOU STOP IT!&quot; Swinging his staff, Christopher caught the next sandbag, the sheer blunt force causing the bag to tear and deflate as sand blossomed and bloomed from the hole, clouding the Prince&#39;s gaze. Sand...Christopher was not unfamiliar fighting in sand...

A hand shot forth and caught the child&#39;s chest, raising him up before slamming him down harshly against the earth. All he could see were two crystal blue eyes seizing his own, and the rumble of a growl as it rolled along a barreled and heaving chest. 

&quot;<strong>I think</strong> you don&#39;t know what true penance is. To be mindless and conscious of your horrors is a true horror: I understand that. But, acceptance of your powerlessness is only forgiveness of yourself. Forgiveness from others is something that can only be earned through retribution...I paid a heavy price for my sins.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119304806608146553 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119304806608146553><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 11:37 AM">11:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;You think I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;ve done, but I do. All too well. I&#39;m a saint only because I died for the sake of others. THAT is how forgiveness is paid forward.&quot; 

His staff raised as he laid the truth bare for the Prince, giving him a glimpse of how retribution would be paid. 

&quot;This war was always going to cause countless suffering...I thought by pairing with a Master that sought to heal, I&#39;d find true strength. But I was wrong...there is no selfless wish. It always causes suffering. My purpose isn&#39;t to help one master, but to bring forgiveness and retribution for those that witness calamities here. You can only seek penance from those you&#39;ve killed with your own death.

Slammed so hard into the ground that he actually managed to slightly dent the wet sand, his back sinking into the a warm puddle of what felt like his slowly seeping blood, Prince could do naught but helplessly choke with his mouth wide open, desperately trying to swallow the air that was so ruthlessly crushed out of his chest. An audible crack could be heard at the moment of impact, though it was unclear whether it came from a fractured rib or from the harsh striking of his teeth as they slammed against each other from the jolt.

Disabled and utterly incapable of even lifting his fingers from the shock, he helplessly and defiantly glared at his assailant from below, forced to listen to his weary words of wisdom, but unfortunately not being in the right state of mind to properly digest them for their worth.

“...penance. Forgiveness. What a joke.”

He eventually managed to cough out under duress, his voice shaky and broken.

“The people I want forgiveness from are already dead. The only one who can give me absolution now is our Lord in Heaven, not some werewolf parading as His Saint and taking His name in vain.”

A monster that had shed his skin, that he might be, but beneath lingered the faith of a devout follower. Thanks to it he had found peace with the circumstances of his birth once before, and perhaps it could help him again.

Shivering, weak and cold, Prince raised his right arm and manifested a small gardening trowel, one which he slowly brought down on Christopher’s forearm pinning him to the ground. At snail’s pace it bumped against his skin, the contact so feeble that it was debatable whether Christopher could even feel it, only for it to be lifted, and dropped on his arm again. And again.
Such manner of futile resistance would have never occurred to the Prince of old, but already the influences of this life had dug their roots deep into his core.

Determination that burned bright and hot.
A desire to live that bordered on selfishness.
An indulgence to live one’s life in a manner of your own choosing.

No regrets. No guilt. Deal with that shit if you care so much, but just hurry up so that you can stop being such a downer.

“Curse you Ann…” Prince cracked a reluctant smile, trickles of blood staining his perfect teeth.

Red and white. Master and Servant. Ann and Prince.
Come to think of it, didn’t his tale begin with two roses of that self-same color as well?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, June 16, 2023 1:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her heart sank as she thought that Prince might have been hit by the fuselage, but relief quickly washed over her when he appeared on land and... lamely started throwing sandbags as a means of self-defence. His sound didn&#39;t lie, Prince was no fighter. He couldn&#39;t hope to win against this dog-faced titan. Not in a hundred years.

But despite the overwhelming difference in strength between them, Prince didn&#39;t give an inch in the ideological battle... as a matter of fact, he really went beyond Ann&#39;s wildest expectations. Pinned to the ground, blood staining his pearly whites, yet smirking and talking shit in his opponent&#39;s face all the same. The once skittish and panicky Servant she had come to know was standing up to someone almost twice his size. The balls on that boy, Ann mused as she slowed down to a walk and approached the Servants.

&quot;All it took was a werewolf pinning you to the ground to make you admit I&#39;m a great Master... man, I&#39;m both touched and slightly hurt!&quot;

She bent down and squished the boy&#39;s cheeks together with one hand, paying no attention to the Saint standing beside her. She had a carefree, if not slightly proud, smile on her face. As if to reassure her Servant that everything would be fine from now on, despite how urgent their situation seemed at the moment.

She turned her head to Christopher&#39;s arm, still pinning Prince to the ground. 

&quot;Let him go.&quot; She asked, keeping her gaze on the Servant&#39;s thick arm. &quot;You heard him, he doesn&#39;t give a damn about penance, forgiveness from the dead or whatever. And if he doesn&#39;t want it, you can&#39;t force him to have it by killing him yourself.&quot;

The two remaining seals on the hand Ann had used to grab Prince&#39;s face began to glow and sizzle slightly as she turned her head up to look Christopher in the eyes, not a hint of hesitation or fear coming through her.

&quot;If you wanted <em>revenge</em>, you should have fought and defeated the dragon who committed all these atrocities. But alas, someone else beat you to it... so let it go, doggy.

Lancer&#39;s grip slackened for a moment. His staff lowered to his side, his breath came in short gasps as his mind wandered. This was all for just a moment. 

&quot;What the <strong>hell</strong> did you just say?!&quot; Lancer spoke again, louder and manic as he threw his Staff aside and reaffirmed a tight hold on the Prince, shaking the boy vigorously with bared fangs. 

&quot;I am his Saint, you little punk! He chose me...he chose me, do you hear me?! What the hell would you know about Sainthood, don&#39;t talk like you know anything!&quot; 

His words quivered with anger, but it was clear this was a nerve being touched. Well, more like prodded. And poked. And ruffled. 

&quot;...Why is everyone in this war just so damn annoying...&quot; 

Lancer rose, picking Prince up by the scruff of his shirt and tossing him to Ann, his arm shaking as he reaches for his staff. The wood warped slightly as it stretched to meet his grip, letting both in on just what else the Saint had to offer besides pure strength. 

&quot;Life was so much simpler...now it&#39;s filled with necromancers, dragons that are princes and children speaking as if they know anything...&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re right, however. The simple matter is that I was too late...I&#39;m always just a bit too late. Who would have expected a murderous creature would be a boy that&#39;s moved beyond animalistic tendencies. Or that he would be able to shake some sense into me...&quot;

He paused, taking in the slightly battered ship on the shoreline before looking out on the rippling tide frothing at their feet. His frame slightly shrunk into the sand as his weight brought him down to his ankles beneath the granules.

Not before offering himself up to be on the receiving end of a rather rough shaking however.

His skittish survival instinct had ceased blaring, the fight was over, and this was simply his opponent&#39;s way to vent the remainder of his frustrations at the poor sport his prey had turned out to be. The trowel in Prince’s hand faded and turned into crackling fragments of magical energy, having served its purpose, but the boat yet remained for some peculiar reason.

It was then that he was unceremoniously tossed at Ann, her serving as his cushion this time, his body accepting being treated like graceless baggage as his wounds still left him incapacitated and unable to brace his fall.

“You…” his mouth struggled to form words from the lingering pain, forcing him to talk at a slowed pace, “...you’re going to let me go after all? You’re not… are you actually a good guy?”

“And no, I haven’t had the chance to pay the local Church a visit yet, have you Ann? But wait. If you are asking that… you really are a Saint, aren’t you!?”

Panic washed over his features as he remembered his earlier mockery, doubting his words when they had been nothing but the truth.

“B-but I’ve never heard of a Saint with a wolf head… ah! Not that having one is a bad thing of course! That is to say… I mean…”

Talking himself into a corner and tripping over himself, it would take Prince some time before he finally quieted down in shame, apologetically glancing at the Saint before him with hesitant eyes.

“...would it be alright if I asked your name?”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ann was taken aback by this visceral reaction, so unlike the solemnity and dutifulness that the Saint had previously shown. Had Prince hit a nerve?

With a swift movement, Ann leapt forward right as Christopher was done with her Servant, her outstretched arms reaching for Prince&#39;s limp body. Her hands wrapped around his waist as she caught him, holding him tighter to her body than was necessary. &quot;Don&#39;t throw him around like a dirty rag doll, he&#39;s beaten enough as is!&quot; She grumbled at the saint, annoyingly blowing a lock of hair that had fallen over her eye out of the way.

She shook her head no at the mention of a church, oblivious to any nuns or children that might be in their care.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t ring any bells... but you need to stop acting chummy with the guy who almost smashed you to a pulp with a boat! Why don&#39;t you ask for his autograph while you&#39;re at it?&quot; After Christopher, it was Ann&#39;s turn to grab Prince by his shirt and shake him vigorously from behind, hoping to physically knock some sense into him... although, she eventually stopped to look at Christopher curiously, expecting his answer more than she cared to admit. It wasn&#39;t every day you met a Saint after all, it would be a shame not to at least get their name.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;...Reprobus.&quot; 

He lifted the staff, hoisting it over his shoulder to lay flat across them, looking back to the pair as they gathered together. The Prince was bleeding, though even his Master felt it necessary to give him a few shakes to stir the pain around. They both seemed to truly understand each other, be on a similar basis with each other. Did they love each other? The beast was gone, but the carnage it left behind remained...but maybe that wasn&#39;t the beasts sins. 

&quot;...that&#39;s probably for the best that you haven&#39;t visited. You wouldn&#39;t have seen my face, regardless. But there is something in there I doubt belongs there...and that might be where my true purpose lies.&quot; 

When a rabid dog is unleashed upon a crowd of children, is the dog swiftly brained for his transgressions? Well, yes, but who carries that stain of sin? The handler.

Perhaps the dog can even lay out that very penance for such sin against them...

&quot;You were a beast. <em>Were.</em> That time is over now. You&#39;re right, but for the wrong reasons. I shouldn&#39;t be delivering judgement against you. I should deliver it against the thing that unleashed you. The Grail has a purpose, and so do I. Perhaps it&#39;s to stop its emissary...&quot; 

Lancer approached both, his shadow looming over them as he made his way past, tattered cloak swirling behind him as he turned back to the city of Aswan. 

&quot;And I&#39;m not a saint. I know that now. After all, I did serve Satan.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“Reprobus… and serving Satan?”

It would appear that despite his faith, his education had not quite covered Saints of Reprobus’ degree, and was thus left with a puzzled expression that tried to piece together the vague clues given to him.

<em>“I will have to look him up after this,”</em> he decided then and there, vowing to not make a fool of himself should they meet again.

His words were of more concern however.

“Your true purpose. To stop the emissary of the Grail…” he turned his head back as he brought his inquiries to his Master, “Do you know anything about that? I didn’t know that the Grail had one, or at least I wasn’t told when I was summoned.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Reprobus, serving <em>Satan</em>? She could only guess what the Saint meant by that.

“Kathleen said the Grail sometimes summons Servants of its own, to act as judges for the War or something. I guess that’s what he’s talking about.” She answered him, keeping her eyes on the Saint’s back. “But… she also said never to make an enemy out of them, unless I wanted to end my run prematurely.”

Reprobus had abandonned his Master, which meant that he was not only working on borrowed time, but was in far from tip-top condition. Still, he was determined to take on the Grail&#39;s emissary. 

“<em>It’s suicide.</em> That guy may have a powerful sound, but even I can tell he’s walking straight to his death.”

“Reprobus!” She shouted, her voice nearly swallowed by the unruly winds of the beach. “I may be a child who knows nothing, I may not have all the answers to your deep philosophical questions, but I do know this: life is too short to dwell on your insecurities and duties all the time!&quot;

She loosened her grip on her Servant and took a half-step towards the fading silhouette of the Saint on the horizon.

&quot;In your case, life is especially short! If I were you, I would think twice before going to your premature death right after you&#39;ve been given a second chance at life!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Prince had nothing to offer him as he made his intentions known, no advice nor words of comfort. He was in no position to, and doing so regardless would be nothing more than an insult to him. Still. Despite Reprobus’ bulking frame and mighty stature, his back seemed unnaturally small as he left. It was a sobering sight; a sad one. It meant that he was…

“... all alone. Unlike me he has nobody to lean on. You don’t suppose we could…? Nevermind, we would probably just make it worse if we followed him.”

The Saint’s tangible form dissolved, his magical energy melting into the rising sun and marking the start of a new day.

Had Ann not been with him, had he been forced to suffer alone with his thoughts, it would have been him walking towards his own death, welcoming the punishment it brought. The release of guilt and sin. Of the two mournful monsters that had clashed today, only one had been fortunate to be saved.

“Ann. I’m glad to be alive.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Why did he have to be so damn stubborn, Ann wondered, not noticing her own hypocrisy as she was just as stubborn in imposing her views on him.

Her Servant&#39;s words carefully pulled her back from the pool of frustration she had slipped into, her stern expression slowly fading, replaced by a gentle curve of her lips. She clenched her hand into a tight fist and gave the Servant a light punch to the chest, chuckling to herself as she did so.

&quot;Now you get it. That&#39;s the feeling!&quot; She said with an unusual note of warmth in her voice. &quot;Never let that feeling of being glad to be alive fade from your heart. Embrace every moment, cherish every breath. Life is a precious gift that should never be thrown away or taken for granted.&quot;

A mischievous sparkle suddenly flickered in her eyes as she noticed her Servant&#39;s minor injuries. Without warning, she quickly stepped into his personal space and scooped him up in her arms, giving the injured servant an impromptu piggyback ride.

&quot;Here, this is your reward for being such a good and understanding boy.&quot; She playfully said, tightening her grip on his legs as she began to walk away, deaf to any complaints her Servant might have about his current position.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

“But you are right. Once you die it’s over.”

A rather obvious realization perhaps, but one that he felt like voicing regardless.
All your comforts and regrets, memories good or bad, all would be washed away and lost, and with them, any opportunity to do better. To do worse. Or even just do the exact same thing. But it was the absence of that choice that was the most damning.

“...thanks for beating that into my head,” he whispered into the riverside breeze, half hoping that she did not hear him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was obviously becoming quite sentimental, and Ann didn&#39;t feel the need to stir him any more than necessary.

Step by step she walked along the sandy path, Servant in tow, their bond seemingly deepening with each step. An unspoken understanding danced in their shared silence, broken only by the occasional splash of a wave or breeze. Both Master and Servant were on the same page, in harmony.

&quot;...feels good.&quot; She voiced the fuzzy feeling growing in her chest, breaking the silence. Unseen, she let her grin fade and gradually became more aware of the weight and warmth of the person she carried on her back.

She had never been in a situation quite like this one before. Offering someone a piggyback ride? Keeping quiet so as not to affect their mood? How uncharacteristically considerate of her. She paused for a moment, as if it would help her to understand the logic behind her strange actions, and reminisced.

She had been captivated by the creature he had once been. Then he revealed his other, arguably lamer side, which at first lowered his value in her eyes... but somewhere along the line, Prince began to matter more than Lindwyrm, his mere presence having woven its way deep into her locked, cold heart.

It was hard to fathom, but the thought of him dying left a bitter taste in her mouth. Pity, compassion, attraction: whatever the reason, she was grew attached. She <em>cared</em> for him, deeply and unequivocally.

She chuckled to herself at the absurdity of this situation, picking up her pace again.

&quot;I&#39;m... glad you&#39;re alive, too.&quot; She said, her wide smiling coming through every word. &quot;So... maybe keep it that way for the foreseeable future. I&#39;d hate for you to bite the bullet before you could watch Ferris Bueller.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Prince chuckled at the nonsensical nature of his Master, accepting that he may never really get to understand her, but he was fine with that. He had no issue with all the things he did know about her after all.

“In that case I’ll agree to watch it after you win and get that sequel of yours. That might be a nice way to digest and put the craziness of this War behind us.”</span></div></div></div></div></div>
