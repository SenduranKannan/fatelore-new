The lights of its concrete spires and shops only illuminated what was a husk of a living city, the flashes of a soul that had long left its streets. The war had done its due part in stripping the core of this city, leaving its mark on its citizens and robbing them of their once peaceful tranquility. 

It was the Grail. It was the child. 

He had to be destroyed. 

The rays of orange that caught the church rose and bled once more over its simple structure as Lancer stood before its entrance, in the very spot when he first landed on the shores of this grail war. Tiredly, the very essence of his body slowly feeling the tug away from the earth, Lancer hefts his staff once more and pushes up the steps, noting the worn walls looking just a bit more weathered. The grace of God was not to be seen lifting these halls. Perhaps God had never been here at all. 

The creak of the door came with it the small billow of dust as Lancer pushed his way inside, ducking beneath the grayed and splintered frame before closing it behind him. He was met once more by the eyes of his fellow saints, their gazes turned upon him as candle light dwindled into melted wax beneath each visage, their brows seemingly twisted down and glaring down at the Saint of Travelers before they were turned back to darkness with the furling of his cloak behind him. 

<em>I&#39;ll be among you, soon.</em>

The galley of the church yawned, with stained glass once more casting the Saint of Travelers in hues of orange and pink as he trailed his hands along the pews, staring intently at the altar and the crucifix above. It dangled, lopsided, threatening to fall to the floor below and scuff the already torn rugs and splintered floorboards below him, each footfall of his own feet causing a strain of support and a puff of smoke to curl about his boots. The pews themselves were tossed on their side, toppling slightly at his touch.

Vines crawled across the walls as the church&#39;s garden erupted into bloom. Flower petals adorned the floor.

Sitting on the overturned dais was a man whose hair went down to his shoulders. It was normally tucked into a ponytail, but it had become undone somewhat recently. In his hands was a device, and earbuds snaked into it. 

An emblem of Atlas snaked on a device attached to his waist, and a twisted command spell was burned into his hand. This was no Sister Rosula.

Illyn looked up.

&quot;<strong>You came.</strong>&quot; Illyn said, unsurprised as he coughed into his hand. After a moment, he continued. &quot;A dog? I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, but at this point...&quot; Illyn shrugged. &quot;Little surprises me anymore. Welcome, and good day. I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for intruding upon this place of God.&quot;

Several vines coiled around Illyn&#39;s wrist, originating from the device as he considered Lancer for a moment. His eyes were bright, and alert. Yet this was a man who was weighed down by something great and terrible.

&quot;And,&quot; Illyn continued, &quot;<strong>I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for the smell.</strong> The noses of canines are supposedly a thousand to ten thousand times stronger than an ordinary man&#39;s. This place smells horrid to me. It must smell awful to you.&quot; 

Bloodstains were splashed all over the church, and to Illyn, it all smelled metallic and disgusting. Before, he could barely discern a difference in smells. Now, it smelled heinous.

&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Illyn said. &quot;I&#39;m aware, of course. Yet it&#39;s hardly fair to cut someone out of a conversation. Knowing too much ruins the ebb and flow of discussion, whether it be academic or not.&quot;

It seemed that more of Rider&#39;s powers had awakened: there was a tranquility in the atmosphere as they moved about, and not a speck of soil clung to their sandals, nor did their clothes catch on any unexpected thorns.

Soon the Servant was strolling up the garden, humming as they licked their stained fingers clean. They came to a halt before the back entrance, before conversation flowed from the inside. The air seemed to quiver; as they placed their hand on the doorknob, it briefly turned red under their touch.

&#39;See? What did I tell you? I can tidy up when I set my mind to it.&#39;

With a flourish Rider threw the door open. In one hand dangled a plastic pail, and in the other, a half-melted toy shovel. They looked every bit like a youth returning from the beach, bucket brimming with assorted treasures from the sea. With the clacking of heels echoing through the room, they happily marched over to join Illyn&#39;s side.

&#39;It was still hard work though,&#39; Rider wiped their forehead, before placing the bucket on a pew. It wobbled and toppled, sending a few chess pieces clattering to the ground.

&#39;Wanna play fetch?&#39; They waved the toy shovel around as they turned towards Lancer. Who was he to reject an innocent request from a child?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121099854345670667 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121099854345670667><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 10:30 AM">10:30 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Oh, his senses had been dulled by that strong purpose that first drove him through the doors, but now that this man brought it up...it <strong>was</strong> vile. The walls were stained with more than just warm filtered light from the sun, as the shadows slowly parted to reveal dried and brown stains of blood. His face remained straight and chiseled, but the hairs along the nape of his canine neck stood on end. It was a tinge of fear that rested in his gut, but something more festered in his chest as Lancer slowly turned back to the man, stepping forward slowly, his coat slipping over the dried and flaking blood thrown across the floor. 

He stepped to the altar, deliberately, with the deep thrum of his own heart loud enough to be heard between them both. The slow and methodical thump of an organ that was being activated through a dark and swirling fury. The glass above the altar had been stained as well, casting a dull red light over the pale eyes of Lancer&#39;s gaze. 

&quot;<strong>What happened.</strong>&quot;  

The door cast open brought with it a flood of orange light, Lancer squinting and shielding his face for a moment, studying the shadow that drew across the yawn of the entrance. Connected with bright sandals and a flowing summer dress, Lancer looked back once his eyes adjusted into the gaze of one that mirrored that early morning blood orange sun. 

What did they tidy up? Lancer couldn&#39;t even register the chess pieces as they clattered next to him, the saint mounting forward and looking down at Rider, his full height stretching as he flitted his gaze between the child and the open backyard door. It called to him, promising nothing but nightmares and misery, answers that he desperately didn&#39;t want but he needed to know. 

&quot;What,&quot; he began, gripping his staff tighter and holding it to his chest, &quot;is out there? What did you &#39;tidy up?&#39;&quot; 

&quot;Where is the Sister, little one?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121118166421090386 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121118166421090386><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 11:43 AM">11:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

In that precise moment, despite being dressed in the clothes of a child, that Servant looked more demonic than it ever had before. Rider just oozed a sort of vindictive aura that just spilled over everyone else.

&quot;I&#39;m glad. It&#39;s a sign of growth and good moral character to clean up one&#39;s messes, no matter how heinous they are.&quot; Illyn pushed his hair out of his eyes and behind his ears with a practiced motion. &quot;Don&#39;t chide our guest. He has been invited by fate, and by your own predictions.&quot;

Illyn stepped forward. &quot;<strong>An introduction, then.</strong>&quot;

&quot;I am Illyn Mariston, Master of Rider. You are Lancer. My fireflies reported your coming.&quot; A few fireflies blinked on the pews and dais. &quot;That over there...&quot; Illyn gestured towards Rider. &quot;Isn&#39;t important. Pay them no mind, <strong>my Rider does love attention.</strong>&quot;

After a moment, the magus sighed and took the earbuds from his ears. &quot;You can probably guess, Lancer. In fact, you probably <strong>know</strong>. Don&#39;t make me spell it out.&quot;

Then they broke into a smile. &#39;Juuust kidding.&#39; A giggle. &#39;I have even better snacks to eat now.&#39;

As Illyn extended his hand in Rider&#39;s direction, the petite Servant quickly ducked underneath it, aligning their head directly beneath the magus&#39; palm in a head pat. &#39;Not only do I adore attention, but I&#39;m also quite skilled at capturing it,&#39; they declared unabashedly. &#39;But it&#39;s alright.

This was a lie, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to utter the truth. If he did, he wasn&#39;t sure what he was going to do, and whether it would spell the end of the two before him, or himself. He closed in on Illyn, turning his eyes back on the Master as he bares his teeth and grips the man by the lapel, hoisting him closer to eye level. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you spell it out? A brute like me can be a little slow on an uptake, after all. <strong>Tell. Me. What. Happened.</strong>&quot; 

His staff raised as well as Lancer pointed it at &quot;Rider&quot;, following one piece of Illyn&#39;s advice by refusing to give him any sort of attention. Not yet, anyway. 

&quot;You be quiet. &#39;Rider&#39;...what a joke. I&#39;ve already met you, you little pissant, I know you&#39;re not a Rider! And I&#39;m not taking anything from you, so keep your hands to yourself if you want to keep them  while longer.&quot; 

His breathing was erratic, with the Saint attempting to hide it behind a fierce growl, but it was clear he was losing the battle for stability. It must have been clear to Illym as well that he was moments away from having his head caved in. 

&quot;ANSWER ME, DAMN IT!

He looked pointedly at Lancer. &quot;I expected a lot from a Knight Class. You are no Berserker, who bumbles around in the dark while chasing shadows. You are capable of something that many life forms envy: intelligent thought.&quot;

Retracting his hand from Rider, Illyn stood protectively in front of his Servant. He could easily calculate the rate of which Lancer flung his staff, once he elected to throw it. Using that, it would be easy to dodge with Rider&#39;s aid.

Besides, he was a married man. He wouldn&#39;t let a child be harmed. Heh, a &#39;child&#39;. What an illogical thought from a logical man.

&quot;Yet you apparently lack <strong>common sense</strong>.&quot; Illyn frowned, &quot;so let me enlighten you.&quot;

&quot;<strong>They&#39;re all dead.</strong>&quot; Illyn said casually, as if discussing an event that he had seen on the news. &quot;<strong>Sister Rosula is dead. Andreas is dead. Even if they&#39;re not dead at this precise moment, they will die. It is proclaimed. It is fate.</strong>&quot;

Illyn looked up towards the shattered cross.

&quot;<strong>It is an act of God.</strong>&quot;

He turned back towards Lancer. &quot;Yet I suspect that you will disagree. People always tend to fight against things that have been set in stone by the actions of fate. It is <strong>very</strong> annoying.&quot; Illyn&#39;s mouth became a hard line.

Lancer looked back to the open door, knowing full well what was out there and what &quot;Rider&#39;s&quot; pale and shovel had been scooping.

The sister was gone...Lancer hadn&#39;t expected she would approve his plan, but he at least had been expecting the chance to save her. And yet, even now, he was still too late. Still too weak. 

&quot;Why?&quot; He asked, pointedly, nostrils flaring. He didn&#39;t particularly care why, as he suspected there was no reason either of these two could give that would be satisfactory. God could not have ordained this. The Holy Grail...was God ever truly present in this war? 

&quot;What could possibly mandate this? Why would fate kill these people?

Rider peered at Lancer from behind Illyn. How fragile the magus&#39; body was, in the presence of the towering, muscular figure of Lancer. Yet he stood as a shield for Rider—was it out of protectiveness, affection, or perhaps some other hidden sentiment? Or was it merely a basic human instinct to safeguard the young? 

Whether the act had been driven by emotion or on autopilot, it didn&#39;t matter to Rider. They rested their forehead against Illyn&#39;s back. How comforting it felt.

&#39;The promise was never meant to be kept. I merely returned at the opportune moment and allowed them to break their word.&#39;

Rider stepped out from behind Illyn. They approached Lancer and playfully tapped the tip of their toy shovel against his staff, as if testing its strength. &#39;But that&#39;s not all. Now you&#39;re here too, with a broken promise of your own.&#39;

They looked at Lancer carefully, as if they were meeting for the first time and wished to commit every detail of his fur-covered skin to memory. &#39;Where is Mr. Adler? You promised to bring him here when we reunited. After preventing the city from unnecessary bloodshed.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121217692855189665 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121217692855189665><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 6:18 PM">6:18 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Broken promises? What kind of maniac makes promises they don&#39;t intend to keep? 

It seems he was one such promise. 

&quot;Given the circumstances, its probably a good thing then that I left him. He was weak. You knew what I valued the day we met...did you know that I would come back to kill you without him? Was that another promise you made that you knew I wouldn&#39;t keep?&quot; 

Lancer sat along one of the broken pews, his breath now a hoarse whisper as he kept his eyes trained on &quot;Rider&quot;. He wanted to save as much strength as possible, but it seemed he knew the truth. Time was running out. That girl on the beach had been quick on the uptake, and while he liked tk think this was for some grander purpose, the truth that he hid from himself started to seep in. 

He was here to die. Whether he could take Rider with him was the true test of his loyalty. The challenge for his sainthood. 

&quot;Many people died while I was with Adler. I stayed by his side, and in the process, this city suffered. So I broke my promise, yeah. But it seems to me that I could&#39;ve held my bargain had I just killed you the moment we met...<em>Astroboy.</em>&quot; 

The shudder in his chest held back the tingle of his own strength coiling beneath his skin, Lancer ready to begin his final test in this Grail War. 

&quot;You know, I have a sneaking suspicion God wants me to kill you, <em>Ruler.</em> What do you think about that?&quot;

It is noble of you to abandon your Master, but you have left yourself weakened as a result.&quot;

IBM clanged against the floor as it became a briefcase. As it unfolded, Illyn turned back to Lancer and shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t do it for God. Do it for you. If God wants you to do anything, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll make you aware of it as you lie, bleeding out on the floor.&quot;

As Lancer spoke of all the deaths that occurred during the Holy Grail War, all Illyn could do was raise an eyebrow. If anything, it was expected that a Holy Grail War would have many deaths.

The Fourth, which occurred only five years ago, had resulted in multiple civillians, including children, dead. The Church had lost its Overseer, and an entire swath of land was left burned. Lancer believed that Ruler was a blight upon the Holy Grail War? No.

<strong>The Holy Grail War was a blight upon the world itself.</strong>

It had no reason to exist.

&quot;I have killed hundreds of people.&quot; Illyn said casually. &quot;I have lost count. It was a statistic that was not worth determining. Was God telling me to do it? I hope not. I did so out of an obsessive desire I had forgotten. I will not atone. There is nothing I can do about it.&quot;

&quot;Which is why we will save everyone from a fate they cannot comprehend. For every person who is killed by an intoxicated driver. For every person killed in a random mugging.&quot;

&quot;We will break the binds of destiny with the bonds of comradery.&quot;

Illyn took a step forward.

&quot;<strong>Except you.</strong> No Servants should exist in the world of living. Goodbye.&quot; Illyn waved sayonara to Lancer, as if he was an old friend leaving for a far away land.

&quot;He&#39;s all yours, <em>Ruler</em>.&quot;

I liked Astro Boy a fair bit.&#39; Rider teased the Saint as he reverted back to addressing them by their old moniker, Ruler. When Illyn joined in, they couldn&#39;t help but place a palm to their face in an exaggerated display.

&#39;Not you too, <em>Master</em>... I&#39;m a bona fide Rider now.&#39; The petite Servant shook their head, though their words carried a hint of amusement rather than genuine hurt. An upward curl of the lips revealed their enjoyment. Rider had not lied—they truly relished every moment when all eyes were fixed upon them.

A greedy little gremlin they were.

&#39;How was I to know, <em>way</em> back then, that you would also be a deal breaker?&#39; Rider tilted their head at Lancer. &#39;Maybe if I had spent more time with you, as I did with the Sister. But then again, I&#39;ve been busy; Illyn and I have much to do in a limited amount of time.&#39;

They chided Lancer with a wag of their finger. &#39;But don&#39;t worry, even if you&#39;re just a quick stop, we&#39;ll still give you all the attention you deserve.&#39;

&#39;Plus, I still want to play some more!&#39;

<em>CRACK!</em>

A single piece of wooden board surrendered under Lancer&#39;s weight, as the once sturdy nails that held it in place seemed to have rusted away. Unlike earlier, Illyn didn&#39;t feel a dip in his mana reserves—not yet, at least. It seemed that he had made a wise decision in filling Rider&#39;s belly with food beforehand!

Lancer&#39;s foot plunged into the hole as splinters flew, disappearing up to the ankle.

At the same time, Rider &#39;vanished&#39;.

His arm pulled his cloak towards his face to block the shower, though it was also to hide the deep pull of his brow. Just how did Ruler do that? Some kind of explosive vision? Could they affect probability? It was too early to tell, but the plastic jabbing against his waist made it clear that whatever they were planning, Ruler was simply toying with him for the moment. Was that because they were a child, or looked like one? Maybe there was truly a malicious side to the young Servant. 

&quot;If only...don&#39;t you touch me, you parasite!&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s arm reared back and waived the end of his staff to Ruler&#39;s face, holding it tight as it suddenly shot forth like a bullet, stretching its length to pierce his enemy through the eye and mount him like a prize along its point. It couldn&#39;t possibly be that easy, but Lancer needed to gauge just the kind of caliber of Servant &quot;Rider&quot; was pretending to be. He had no doubt in his mind the child could have simply killed him there, yet they chose not to. Or rather, they didn&#39;t think it would be &#39;fitting.&#39; Maybe they were limited by their own preconceived notion of fate. 

<em>There has to be more to this...I can&#39;t have simply walked into my death. Lord...give me the strength. I can end this war, if you just give me the strength.</em>

Unpredictability would not save Lancer. He may have stronger parameters than Rider, but Lancer lacked the support of a Master.

&quot;All Servants are parasites.&quot; Illyn said in a bored tone. &quot;You siphon magical energy to exist. That&#39;s what makes you inefficient when compared to the might of Atlas. For example:&quot;

<strong>Clang.</strong> IBM fell to the floor with a heavy noise, before belching out a revolver. Quickly understanding that he was out of wooden stock for more firearms, Illyn shot the dangling cross, before kicking IBM under it.

The cross, composed of wood and metal, disappeared into IBM. Illyn smiled, knowing he had material to work with.

IBM beeped, printing out dozens of shotguns in a predictable arc towards Illyn. Calculating their direction, Illyn grabbed each one and fired.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG BANG!</strong> A wall of steel approached Lancer and Rider. Rider would dodge this, if he cared to check for it. Assuming he didn&#39;t know it was coming to begin with.

&quot;Lance like his?&quot; Illyn sighed as Thunderclap appeared from IBM. He tossed it towards Rider. &quot;Catch.&quot;

With his strength, an ordinary person—or even an ordinary Servant—would surely struggle to catch sight of the staff, let alone evade it!

But Lancer felt no feedback. The staff effortlessly passed through the space where Rider had been, except they were no longer there.

&#39;Parasite?&#39;

Rider&#39;s laughter echoed from above. Lancer blinked, and in the next instant, the petite Servant landed atop his staff, tiptoeing on the wooden grooves.

&#39;I like to think of us as talent agents,&#39; Rider extended their arm to intercept Thunderclap, before twirling it like a baton. &#39;And <em>my</em> client,&#39; they gestured towards Illyn with a bow, &#39;was a representative handpicked to participate in a game show hosted by the Holy Grail. It&#39;s like the X Factor! But with the Grail as the sole judge.&#39;

Rider leaped down from Lancer&#39;s staff, paying little attention to the bullets fired by Illyn. Whether it was the result of precise aiming, or a display of remarkable teamwork, the projectiles zoomed past Rider&#39;s body as if they held no regard for their presence whatsoever. They didn&#39;t even bother to dodge.

&#39;How does this thing work?&#39; Rider curiously examined Thunderclap. &#39;Electricity? What about the reverse? What if I...&#39;

Pure, unadulterated mana suffused Thunderclap. Electricity crackled, mirroring the sparkles in Rider&#39;s eyes. &#39;Ooh,&#39; they exclaimed softly. &#39;That&#39;s pretty. Quite the expensive toy you&#39;ve given me, Illyn!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121897433350287420 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121897433350287420><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, June 23, 2023 3:19 PM">3:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He was getting deja vu to a certain graveyard...

But, this was not just a battle between Servants. The crack of lightning from Rider&#39;s new toy was flooded through by the crack of his Master&#39;s orchestra, as Illyn&#39;s shotguns&#39; discharged and seized hold of his senses. The bullets approached Lancer, eager to shred through and flay his skin...but their trajector was taking longer than anticipated. If anything, they seemed to float in place as they approached Lancer, attempting to bore through an invisible miasma. Lancer rescinded his attention from Rider, no doubt annoying the childish Servant, but the bullets took a bit of priority, and offered a chance to take charge of at least one part of this battle. 

He bore his staff around, twisting his arm and aiming the instrument back at the bullets suspended around him, swatting them and swinging wildly at the field of steel. He looked like a savage beast, with each swing bringing a new growl from deep in his chest to bubble forth. Half of it was frustration, but the other was the edge of exhaustion and will waning away. Already he was using so much mana; Illyn was right in one regard, he was as much of a parasite as Rider was. He at least had a battery to pull from. 

This meant Lancer had to work a little harder, plan accordingly, fight to his very last breath and make accommodations to the very end. Which was why it might have seemed strange when he suddenly shot himself into the air, his Staff stretching him towards the ceiling as a claw dug into the worn wood above. His hand held himself aloft, the Saint bracing himself while keeping an eye on the field below. He gave himself some distance, but at what cost?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Dodge this.&quot; 

Distance was all he needed. Popping free, the bullets resumed their path, but instead of simply punching through the wall behind Lancer, Illyn and Rider were faced with a rain of steel that started tearing through the church around them. Somehow Lancer had redirected the bullets, now submitting both to a hail of steel. 

THUNK

Lancer&#39;s staff passed right by the tip of Rider&#39;s nose, digging itself into the floor and piercing through to the foundations beneath. Slowly, the length rescinded, before shooting forth again, aiming to skewer Rider once more. With a bird&#39;s eye view, Lancer had a bit more margin for error, along with an onslaught of return to sender bullets to aid him. 

&quot;There&#39;s no lance like mine.&quot;

So much Magecraft rejects Mystery. Sometimes, it is best to accept change.&quot;

Illyn said this, surprising himself in the process. He did not truly believe this, even as he embodied it. Several Illyns had come before him, and each one refused to look beyond their purpose of fulfilling the goal of their research. Meanwhile, <em>he</em> as <em>he</em> was now wanted to apply the concepts of his research.

Unpredictability was a sin that blighted the world. Before, he wanted it gone. He still did. All negative side effects of randomness that affected <em>him</em> should be purged.

Did that simply need to include him, though?

Even as one cell of his mind thought this through, the rest was already calculating how to best deal with the iron rain from Lancer. He had already calculated everything regarding the bullets and where they would land. Yet he was confined by his flesh. Even as a magus, he could not deflect them all.

But <strong>Rider</strong> could.

Rider suddenly felt a rush of information flow into his mind about the rates and trajectories of the bullets as they flung around. It was nothing compared to what Rider was <em>actually</em> capable of, but it was a supplement that saved magical energy.

It was <strong>efficient</strong>.

Using a brief burst of Reinforcement in his legs to rush behind cover, Illyn felt a piece of shrapnel hit his leg. &quot;<strong>Tsk!</strong>&quot; Illyn grunted in pain as he hauled himself behind an upturned pew and began reloading his firearms.

It was as if their velocity gradually decreased as they approached, like the curve of an asymptotic function that never quite reached its target. To the eyes of a Servant, the metal nuggets practically became motionless, suspended in the air like miniature golf balls waiting for a good swing.

And swing Lancer did. Curiosity danced across Rider&#39;s face as their attention shifted from their new toy to the spectacle created by the Saint, who had secured himself to the ceiling with a claw and started swatting the bullets back at the Rider pair.

<strong>&#39;Protection from Arrows?&#39;</strong> Rider had the gall to ponder even as bullets rained down from above. &#39;Similar, but not quite. Making adjustments based on new input.&#39;

A deluge of information flooded Rider&#39;s mind. Numbers, trajectories, time, coordinates...Illyn spared no effort as he shared every single calculation derived from the bullets&#39; new paths. Normally, a human or even a technologically impaired Servant would struggle to process such a disorganized amount of data...

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t mind if I do ♪&gt;</em>

...but not Rider, it seemed. 

Crimson eyes remained fixated on the space between them and the Saint, mapping out a slew of &#39;safety zones&#39; indicated by Illyn&#39;s calculations. It didn&#39;t matter if they faced a dozen, a hundred, or even a thousand bullets—their sole objective was to reach those &#39;safety zones&#39;, and no bullet could ever hope to graze their skin. Nothing more, and nothing less.

Of course, there was also the matter of protecting their Master. However, Illyn made Rider&#39;s job several times easier, as he turned himself from a <em>variable</em> into a <em>constant</em>, wisely positioning himself behind cover and staying there without so much as moving a muscle. A shard of shrapnel pierced their leg, but that would be the only harm he would endure for the rest of the night!

The remaining bullets Rider simply let go, allowing them to embed themselves into the church&#39;s walls and floor, creating a mess of the once beautiful architecture.

To Lancer&#39;s eyes, everything played out like a meticulously choreographed performance. Rather than relying on instinct, Rider seemed to transition from one spot to another, as if they knew the exact place to be at any given moment. When Lancer thrust his staff towards Rider once more, he immediately realized his mistake: this time, Rider seemed to have started moving <strong>at the same time</strong> as he did, almost as if they had anticipated his intentions in advance. The staff barely grazed the tip of Rider&#39;s hair—not due to mere luck, but rather because Rider had already sidestepped and patiently awaited the staff&#39;s arrival.

&#39;Are you trying to play whack-a-mole?&#39; The petite Servant teased. With almost impeccable timing, they capitalized on the momentum that prevented Lancer from retracting his arm, and launched themselves into the air. The tip of Thunderclap pressed softly against Lancer&#39;s sternum.

&#39;My turn now,&#39; Rider declared, and electricity surged.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122273940044255312 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122273940044255312><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 24, 2023 4:15 PM">4:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Could see the correct path even before Lancer had walked through the doors. As if Rider could see...

<strong>Fate.</strong>

The pulse of electricity crackled against his covered sternum, and while his leather armor tried to absorb some of the discharge, the resulting blast pushed Lancer through the roof. 

His mass broke a wide hole through the mottled wood, and sent a bolt arcing through the morning sky as the Saint narrowly avoided the full brunt, rolling onto his back and gasping slightly from the attack. That didn&#39;t really hurt but the fact Rider was actually able to break through that onslaught was miraculous. 

Rays peeked from behind the foliage of the surrounding trees and stretched across Lancer&#39;s face, prompting the Saint to roll over and brace himself against the weakened rooftops, panting slightly. What the hell was happening. Could Rider see rhe future? Did they just know how this entire thing would play out...

Or was there something more to this. 

&quot;...Lord...are you asking me...are you telling me that I need to kill that man...their Master?&quot; 

It was a weak hypothesis. Flimsy and tangentially evident, but there wasn&#39;t a lot else he could really refer to. 

He had to push this test a bit further. He held his Lance inches from his hole, gauging the point of impact to see if he could catch thr Rider with the cover of wood at his call. Was it based on sight? If not, then Lancer was certainly in trouble. As well as that Master down below. 

His Staff stretched forward and punched through the ceiling, racing once more for Rider&#39;s temple.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122639907278557236 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122639907278557236><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 4:30 PM">4:30 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If this had been that hotel, and Illyn had been lying dead on the floor, he would&#39;ve likely died for Lancer&#39;s ego, confident in the capability of IBM to return him back to life to continue his research. 

Yet now, he knew that dying <em>hurt</em>. He knew what would happen if he returned to that box, to that sea of Illyns slaughtering each other in a maze with no exit or prize. He wanted to <em>live</em>. That was logical. It made perfect sense.

Yet in a vacuum, it was an illogical action for a man with functional immortality.

&quot;Blast. Protection From Arrows? Such an annoying skill. Is it based on sight?&quot; Illyn muttered through his link with Rider and verbally. He produced gauze and other medical supplies from IBM as the fight continued. 

Blast, this <em>hurt</em>. Yet this pain was nothing in the grand scheme of things. Was this what his victims felt? That was unfortunate, if that was the case.

Rider gracefully touched down amidst the cascade of wood chips and plaster. They traced the bullet holes scattered across the floor with the tip of Thunderclap, looking thoughtful.

<em>&lt;Not sight, nothing like me. But not pure reflexes either. It seems to be a variation of the Skill that slows down projectiles rather than letting him evade them outright.&gt;</em> Rider shared their observations through the telepathic link. <em>&lt;But regardless of the true nature of that Skill, it still pales in comparison to what we can do. After all...&gt;</em>

<em><strong>&lt;Results derived on the basis of the Newtonian Laws are absolute!&gt;</strong></em>

Rider giggled. They basked in the warmth of the morning sun, like a little bird taking flight for the first time. Forget Lancer, who had been easily blasted away. In this very moment, they were the shining star!

&#39;I did it!&#39; Rider exclaimed as they flocked to Illyn&#39;s side. &#39;I bested another Servant!&#39;

But things wouldn&#39;t be so simple now, would it? Lancer possessed remarkable resilience, even among other Servants. They also had a brain. If targeting Rider proved to be futile, then it would only be in their best interest to...

&#39;Stay where you are,&#39; Rider advised Illyn. &#39;According to my calculations, there are only a few possible ways Lancer could pose a threat to y—&#39;

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

A deep, thunderous roar echoed from above, but it came neither from a gunshot, nor Lancer&#39;s snarls. Illyn&#39;s pupils dilated; Rider watched their Master in bewilderment as something warm trickled down their own face. Their hand instinctively reached for their forehead.

&#39;...Eh?&#39;

<em>clang</em>

Thunderclap slipped from Rider&#39;s grasp, followed by the toy shovel. The petite Servant sank to their knees and collapsed onto the floor.

<strong>Rider gracefully touched down amidst the cascade of wood chips and plaster.</strong>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">From measurements to raw data.</code>

<strong>Rider shared their observations through the telepathic link.</strong>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">From raw data to information.</code>

<strong>Rider giggled.</strong>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">From information to hypothesis.</code>

<strong>Rider exclaimed as they flocked to Illyn. &#39;I did it! I bested another Servant!&#39;</strong>

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">From hypothesis to a working simulation.</code>

<strong>&#39;JUUUST KIDDING.&#39;</strong> Rider spun on their heel, raising both arms towards the sky. &#39;Unlike you, I don&#39;t need to physically test my hypotheses. I can run all the simulations I need to right <em>here</em>.&#39; They tapped the side of their head. <strong>&#39;If diverting my attention from the ceiling and rushing to my Master guarantees my demise, then I can prune that undesirable future away by altering just a single variable.&#39;</strong>

Rider stayed where they were.

<em>&lt;Guns.&gt;</em> They instructed Illyn. <em>&lt;As many as IBM can provide. It&#39;s impossible to discern the true nature of that Skill without sufficient testing. Does it work on all projectiles? Is there an upper limit? Size, weight, quality, rate of fire...we need to collect more data.&gt;</em>

Rider took another step away from Illyn, and started charging Thunderclap once more. 

<em>&lt;Lancer is resilient and stubborn as a mule. He&#39;s most likely to concentrate his attack on me until he can secure a guaranteed shot at you. However, his mobility is limited by his physical build, parameters, mana output, and his caution towards my capabilities. He will most likely set up an ambush, during which he will remain stationary.&gt;</em>

<em>&lt;The window is small. Don&#39;t worry about me. As soon as you sense something, fire away.&gt;</em>

While aiming for the head was undeniably a sound strategy, the challenge lay in the fact that hitting such a small target increased the likelihood of missing exponentially. Plus, this time, Rider had their eyes trained on the ceiling throughout.

Rider ducked, their agile Servant body fully capable of matching the split-second decision made by their brain. The wooden staff shot through the ceiling like a bolt of lightning, grazing Rider&#39;s head and knocking off their sunhat, before impaling it into the ground.

Without missing a beat, Rider wrapped their hand around Lancer&#39;s staff. The window to act <em>was</em> small, but Lancer was rather large. Plus, Rider wasn&#39;t aiming for the Saint&#39;s head.

&#39;The center of mass would do,&#39; they mused, then tore the staff out of the ground.

The air screeched.

A staff shot out of the small hole Lancer had created, aimed in the general direction he had positioned himself before the attempted murder on Rider&#39;s life. Though there seemed to be a notable difference in size between his staff and the one that was returned to him—it wasn&#39;t his own staff, but a fully charged Thunderclap crackling with electricity!

&#39;Let&#39;s trade!&#39; Rider&#39;s voice chimed as another chunk of the ceiling caved in. They emerged from the hole—which had become rather large by now—wielding Lancer&#39;s borrowed staff like a hockey stick. With a sideways swing, they aimed directly for Lancer&#39;s head!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122988289461330074 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122988289461330074><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, June 26, 2023 3:34 PM">3:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

If nothing else, you might have even though Christopher had hit himself and was hoisted aloft by his own petards. Of course, anyone taking a look deeper might have simply thought it was a gamble that Christopher lost, and one thay he might even pay dearly for. But in the split moment it takes to register something flying towards you, when you can truly take stock of your scenario and your fate, Christopher saw something different. Christopher was not a genius by any metric. If anything, Marcus, as his former master, might have considered him even to be a bit slow. Anyone who did meet him might have that assumption, and who could truly blame them for that? Even Rider and Illyn might have even thought of this. 

No, he wasn&#39;t a genius. But he wasn&#39;t stupid. Far from it. And sometimes that&#39;s more than enough, along with an instinct for combat and battle. That includes the measurements of your opponent and the methods to kill them. That&#39;s why Christopher knew that he would be getting hit, not by Thunderclap, but by his own staff. 

Because he should have killed Rider just now. Everything had been set in place for that blow to kill Rider. His opponent was defenseless and wide open, but also arrogant and sloppy. These attacks hadn&#39;t done nearly enough damage to warrant fearing. No, the true fear was in how Rider was even managing to keep up like this. The answer was so simple. <strong>They weren&#39;t.</strong>

Lancer twisted in place, Thunderclap flying past and just grazing the side of his armor, a sliver of his battlements peeling away like the skin of an apple. And then Rider smashed the side of his face with a sickening <strong>CRNCH</strong>. 

<strong>&quot;Sure.&quot;</strong>

Blood trickled down the length of the staff, Lancer&#39;s eye twitching at the end slightly. Part of it from having his skull knocked on, but part of it was something welling inside. Lancer had thought to utilize his very rage to win this battle.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For once, his hypothesis was proven...feasible. He wouldn&#39;t glut himself on the satisfaction of being right. Not yet. After all, they were still testing things out. 

&quot;Let&#39;s trade, little one. You shouldn&#39;t have survived that...it&#39;s making this a little interesting. Perhaps I&#39;ll figure out your trick, yet. Because that definitely should have killed you. I didn&#39;t think it would, but I know you were in the perfect position for that to work. Which means you knew I was going to do that, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re smart. But not that smart.&quot;

Lancer gripped his staff before yanking hard, grabbing Rider around the neck with the other before squeezing. Hard. 

&quot;I&#39;m not just a Saint...I served Satan too, you know. So I&#39;ve got a real idea about cruelty.&quot; 

Lancer slammed Rider down against the roof, holding his Staff toward the hole point first, eyeing the church&#39;s interiors. 

&quot;You&#39;re planning to bank on my stubbornness, huh? Cause you just can&#39;t fathom how these bullets ain&#39;t workin&#39;? What if I told you I was expecting that to pique your interest?

<em>Make that seventy-five.</em>

After a moment, IBM began to print out as many firearms as possible at an accelerated rate. How did Servants manifest their skils? Was there a set limit to one&#39;s ability to prevent something, or was it a simple constant that nothing would hit Lancer?

<em>Printing.</em> IBM began spewing out seventy-five firearms.

<em>Firing.</em> Shells littered the ground as every firearm Illyn had left unloaded their clips towards Lancer.

&quot;He&#39;s that smart.&quot; Illyn yelled out over the dun of shotgun blasts. &quot;On this, I assure you. Rider is a stupid genius. He&#39;ll run circles around you, given enough time.&quot;

Damn, this wound was annoying. It made Illyn want to smash his head into the wall.

<em>He&#39;s more than you realize.</em> Illyn&#39;s voice rang out in Rider&#39;s head. <em>He is a walking contradiction, like me. He is someone who has seen both good and evil, yet unlike me, continues to willingly do good. He is either a messiah or someone with free will. Do not be blinded by his stubbornness.

His eyes scanned through the incoming storm, his Lance gently nudging any bullet that had a trail towards any extremities on his person. The angles were chaotic as silver and brass ants crawled through the space between them. But, no matter how much one tried, we are all subject to patterns...

This one was a little harder to parse, but ultimately Lancer found a decent triangulation. If nothing else, he could get a ballpark idea of where to aim. 

&quot;Got it. Now, since we&#39;re both testing, this should give you plenty of data, little Rider.&quot; 

Lancer spoke plainly, bluntly, but even more so, a little gleefully, as his grip tightened around Rider&#39;s neck and pulled him closer, affixing the tip of his Lance to the small of his back, before extending it forth. 

<em>I&#39;ll pierce Rider through, and potentially his Master. And if I&#39;m wrong in my assumption, they both should die. If I&#39;m right, however, I will be closer to death, but also to the truth.</em>

Bullets caromed off the ceiling, Lancer&#39;s body, and his staff, raining down like scattered marled. Despite their overwhelming numbers, the bullets provided no advantage to the Rider pair. Lancer shrugged them off—most of them, at any rate—and the ones he couldn&#39;t avoid, he attended to them personally, skillfully deflecting them with a flick of his staff, much like Rider had done before.

He executed these maneuvers with such nonchalant ease, as if eager to demonstrate the insignificance of the attack. After all, what could a pair of <em>scholars</em> hope to achieve against a messiah of God? Gather data, input it into a calculator, and lecture him about how his Skill defied the laws of physics?

&#39;It is enough. You are right—I have gathered an abundance of data. Perhaps even more than I needed.&#39;

Rider&#39;s voice sounded hoarse. They had remained motionless since being pinned by Lancer, obediently lying on the rooftop and held in his grip, their silver hair cascading around them like freshly fallen snow. The hail of bullets seemed to have left them unscathed as well; could it be that Lancer&#39;s own abilities unexpectedly protected them in the process?

Simultaneously, Illyn received a telepathic echo of their words in his mind. &#39;All of the bullets that entered your vicinity were affected, regardless of their number. However, the Thunderclap that I threw maintained its original speed, despite being slower than the bullets. You had to dodge that personally. What made the difference? Size? I think not. Thunderclap is a <strong>high-ranking artifact</strong>. I believe that&#39;s where the distinction lies.&#39;

Rider blinked owlishly. They remained docile even as Lancer raised them up by the neck, like a little lamb awaiting its fate in the slaughterhouse. The Saint readied their weapon...

God, had it always been so <em>warm</em> up here?

Strands of silver hair lifted around them, flowing in the air as if carried by an unseen updraft. The air grew hot, almost unbearably so. Rider&#39;s neck became scorching hot under Lancer&#39;s hand, as if they had been thrust into a furnace. Had the Saint not been summoned as a Servant, the sensation would surely have been amplified tenfold. And had he smelled <em>smoke</em>?

Then he heard a sound, a crisp, crackling sound, and his eyes immediately witnessed it: the cheap sandal on Rider&#39;s feet <strong>burst into flames</strong>.

Followed by their dress. The white fabric began to scorch and burn, engulfing the petite Servant in a hellish blaze. The air wavered, distorted. The heat gathered around Rider, seemed to radiate out of their very being.

Lancer saw skin of porcelain white, so pristine it seemed otherworldly. As flame continued to consume the hem of the dress, he saw, suspended between Rider&#39;s legs, curling about gently was...

<strong>A tail.</strong>

A slender, smooth, and elongated tail.

And its pointed tip, resembling that of a spearhead.

Rider somehow knew exactly how to evade certain death every time. Ergo, surely there was some kind of skill that allowed them to know exactly what was set to happen...

But fate has a funny way of providing unexpected surprises...if nothing short of providing truly left field destruction to hypotheses. 

Rider...was not who Lancer thought they were. He didn&#39;t truly have any reason to care.  Rider was but a symbol of the coming cataclysm, an anomaly of an anomaly that was the destruction of the Holy Grail War. Lancer needed nothing more than that...

So why did he care now about who Rider was? 

The heat against his palm was nothing compared to the chill that froze him in place and slowed his staff, it&#39;s point stopping mere spaces from plunging through the small of Rider&#39;s back. Nerves partly, but now Lancer couldn&#39;t be sure this heat wouldn&#39;t be enough to light his own Noble Phantasm on fire. 

&quot;...I...You&#39;re not him.&quot; He stated, plainly. Too plainly, judging by the quake of his hands as he gripped Rider tight, flesh searing as he did his best to restrict the child further. 

<em>I...why do I feel...he didn&#39;t look like this, and yet...I know it&#39;s them. It&#39;s the one...the dark one. Only they should know that name...</em> 

&quot;<em>pant pant</em>...don&#39;t call me that. It&#39;s Christopher. Or rather just Lancer to you.&quot; 

Lancer decided it was worth it to try, and proceeded to lengthen his Staff to pierce through Rider&#39;s very spine and release that boiling blood down into the church below. Perhaps the spray would be enough to melt Illyn, should his Lance not pass through and gouge him as well.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1124191881849483284 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1124191881849483284><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 29, 2023 11:17 PM">11:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I did not think you were capable of something so... low.&quot; Illyn smiled wanely as he gazed upon Rider&#39;s devil persona. It was a good choice, even if it was a step up from the genuine article. &quot;Though I suppose that this is the most efficient route towards your outcome.&quot;

&quot;However...&quot; Illyn frowned, before raising a hand in a calming manner. &quot;Respect our Saint Christopher. Our Reprobus. Even if you do not make mistakes, that does not mean others do not. It is something you should understand as you grow more accustomed to your current form.&quot;

Reprobus. Saint Christopher. One of the many maryrs created by the Roman Empire in its attempts to crush and stamp out Christianity in an attempt to keep the Roman Pantheon in power.  Lancer was an interesting classification. Martyrs were also unique. They were the types of individuals who only gained power in death.

In a way, they were genuine Heroic Spirits, beyond the echoes given physical form by the Holy Grail. When they died, people remembered, and it gave them motivation to move forward. They did not need to manifest as Servants to become such a thing.

For a saint to serve the devil... It was certainly irony. Yet Christopher had chosen God. 

That was commendable. If only Illyn was that strong. Could someone like that fall into the evils proclaimed by Rider?

No. Illyn would not be taught ethics.

<em>Hiss...</em> Flecks of Illyn&#39;s clothes were burned and melted through as the Master dodged the bloody rain. He quickly tossed off his overcoat and fed it into IBM as he scooched further into cover.

<em>Is this required for the grand design, Rider? This mental warfare? Or are you simply experimenting? I disapprove of the systemic deconstruction of one&#39;s ideals.</em>

With a surprisingly firm grip, they grasped Lancer&#39;s hand, which had been choking their neck for far too long. 

&#39;Everything that I am has been shaped by humanity. The very same humanity to which you belong, Master.&#39; Rider blinked innocently. &#39;Are you perhaps dissatisfied with the true nature of mankind&#39;s own creation? If it were not Lancer, but me who had made a mistake just now, would you stand by my side, defending me, or would you cast me away, <strong>as humanity has done before?</strong>&#39;

Slender fingers encased Lancer&#39;s own, slowly but steadily prying them open, leaving imprints on his hand and singeing the fur on his skin. 

A seemingly small child, yet possessing enough strength to rival the Saint?

But Rider was no ordinary child. Nor were they fully human. Despite their delicate appearance, their body proved to be far from fragile. The tip of the staff that had been meant to pierce their spine, encountered unexpected resistance as they grazed bone. It stopped, unable to extend any further, like a rock that had struck the surface of a diamond.

Rider&#39;s smile turned impish.

&#39;I am <em>me</em>, silly.&#39; They playfully taunted the Saint. &#39;Though I don&#39;t think you can really understand how complex I am. After all, the ones who made me were the very ones who said <em>&quot;No!&quot;</em> to the concept of God. How could your wooden stick ever hope to unravel my existence?&#39;

A swift kick to Lancer&#39;s head freed Rider from his grasp, as the petite Servant pivoted around his land and landed on both feet. Capitalizing on the momentum of their swing, they hoisted Lancer by his hand in an upwards arch, before executing a slam that sent them both crashing into the church below.

Small, fibrous wings spread from Rider&#39;s back; they landed gracefully on top of the fallen Saint, before swiveling around in Illyn&#39;s direction and raised both of their hands.

The ground caved beneath the combined weight of both, Lancer himself briefly passing into unconscious thought. 

<em>You carried me with such grace, you&#39;d think you were used to carrying the world on your shoulders, Christopher.</em> 

&quot;That&#39;s not my name...&quot; 

His voice was hoarse and airy as he returned, in time to catch the glimpse of Rider&#39;s wings spreading languidly above, flapping aimlessly as the childish imp seemed to be offering a challenge. To court Christopher to damnation. 

&quot;I never...never consider how complex someone is,&quot; Lancer retaliates, pulling himself from the splintered wood caressing his frame, balancing himself on the sturdy length of his staff. 

&quot;If you&#39;re calling me by that name, then you should know that I don&#39;t really give a damn about how hopeless it seems...I don&#39;t have anything left.&quot; 

His staff whirls in the air as he bares the point towards Rider once more, which seemed at this point to be a rather repetitive juncture. All Martyrs could squash demons; what hope did he have against a God? 

&quot;I guess I could humor you, though. You&#39;re some kind of altruistic being, am I getting that right? Humanity casts you aside, but no matter how much you struggle with it, you can&#39;t help but stand by them? You&#39;re going to be the one to help it, ultimately. And <em>I&#39;m</em> standing in the way? Kid...Ruler. I can only assume you keep calling me Reprobus to try and shake me.&quot; 

Lancer scans the room, looking for a sign of Illyn in the wreckage. With how impervious Rider proved against that last attack, now might be the time to consider taking after the Master. If Illyn was truly the key to this Servant reaching their potential, then perhaps Lancer&#39;s mission was more than just stopping a Holy Grail War. He couldn&#39;t help but think Rosula and the clergy were only one of many more deaths.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126345319865647206 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126345319865647206><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 9:54 PM">9:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>__
&quot;Do you even know what my other name means? Christopher? I don&#39;t get it for nothin, I can tell you that at least. In short, it means I don&#39;t bow down easily, and I don&#39;t scare that hard. Even when I ought to...and you seem like you really should scare me. I guess I&#39;m just too stupid for it. But maybe it&#39;s more...I just don&#39;t really get it. I know what a Ruler is, but what I can&#39;t fathom is what&#39;s next.

Step. Step.</em> Illyn appeared from behind cover, hand on his briefcase. In that moment, he looked like an ordinary businessman going to his nine to five, barring the wound on his foot. <em>Step. Step. Step.</em>

Why was he moving from beyond cover? He was safe. Ruler&#39;s calculations proved it. There was absolutely zero reason to reveal himself to an enemy Servant, especially with his wound. Yet the wound was a constant. It would yield no unexpected weakness that had not already been taken into account.

Therefore, it was understood and discarded.

&quot;I am not human.&quot; Illyn shrugged innocently, creating a pair out of Ruler&#39;s blinking. &quot;Sixty-five percent is not a hundred, I am sorry to say. Therefore, consider me an individual looking into the &#39;box&#39; of human interaction. <strong>Be better.</strong>&quot;

A direct order. Yet Illyn&#39;s expression was not one of discuss. Instead, it was one of churlish bemusement, as if explaining to a child why hurting others was wrong. This was not turning away, but something else. Instead, the program that forced Ruler to tick was being nudged in a different direction.

Even as that program looked Illyn&#39;s way.

&quot;Lancer will never bend. It&#39;s not in his programming.&quot; Illyn shrugged again. &quot;He is stuck in his ways, as his right as a Servant. As an individual. As a shadow on the cave wall reflecting the original being.&quot; 

&quot;Lancer.&quot; Illyn turned towards him. &quot;As many as is needed to equalize the mathematical formula that is a better future. Less than what the alternative is. We are creating a better world. One where consequences of evil men do not affect the lives of the good. A world without Roman Emperor Denius. That is my truth. <strong>My</strong> promise. &quot; 

His hands were stained, and they would never be unclean. Everything that he did, he did for <em>her</em>. Was that the right thing to do? It didn&#39;t matter, so it was best to simply play the part of Illyn Mariston until the very end.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126418004419284993 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126418004419284993><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 6, 2023 2:43 AM">2:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Illyn raised an eyebrow at Lancer. &quot;See!

Illyn&#39;s face was flat as he held up his command spell. He had two left. One was spent cursing Kalki to damnation. Getting rid of Lancer was in the cards. It was all part of the predictable timetable of events put forward by his Servant. Rider&#39;s Grand Design.

&quot;<strong>With my command spell, I order the release of your Noble Phantasm. Give him your True Name, my little devil.</strong>&quot;

Some kind of demon?&#39;

The joke didn&#39;t seem to land. Even Rider could tell that Lancer wasn&#39;t very amused, but they didn&#39;t let that discourage them. After all, what could the Christ bearer possibly do against a being he had never defeated in his own legend? At least, that seemed to be the point Rider was driving at, until they spoke up again.

&#39;Running this body gets quite expensive, you know?&#39; Rider pointed towards themselves. &#39;Before I found a Master to take care of my needs, I had to figure out a way to stay energized <em>somehow</em>. And guess who makes the best super batteries?&#39;

Rider licked their lips. &#39;<strong>Humans are special.</strong> They can defy the principles of thermodynamics and generate an almost infinite amount of energy via the power of <em>belief</em>. It was the best source of energy I could find to sustain my existence...&#39;

&#39;But not anymore,&#39; the petite Servant took a step forward, allowing the tip of Lancer&#39;s staff to touch their skin. &#39;I never knew how efficient it could be to have a Master provide for me directly. Not to mention...&#39;

Rider opened their arms wide.

&#39;This Command Spell everyone speaks of so fondly,&#39; the space around them began to vibrate as Illyn evoked the red tattoo on his hand. &#39;It&#39;s got to be even more delicious than <strong>half the electrical output of this country</strong>, isn&#39;t it?&#39;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">An arbiter of a system does not interfere with the system itself. They observe, interpret, and educate, maintaining impartiality and staying outside of the system&#39;s boundaries.</code>

A wish?

No matter the reason, one simple truth remained: <strong>they were needed.</strong>

Rider raised their hands. The state of the world, distilled into variables and cradled within their palms.

Lancer&#39;s staff shattered.

It shattered so suddenly, so completely, as if torn apart by innumerable blades, only that there was no blade, and its utter destruction transpired in an instant. Once formidable, the Noble Phantasm disintegrated into shimmering, golden particles that dispersed into the morning light.

&#39;Your command has been received, Illyn.&#39;

A surge of magical energy suffused Rider&#39;s body. How generous it was, how remarkable! Rider closed their eyes. When Christopher opened his, the face of the Demon was mere inches away from his own. Their tail coiled around his throat, its pointed tip pressed against his jugular and puncturing deep into his skin.

The true Master. So to see the culmination of that devotion, and the promise to uphold those statutes, break apart at the behest of a simple command made the smell of his own neck searing against the tail of the Demon distant and faded. Fire scorched his fur, but his chest was cold as Lancer staggered in the Demon&#39;s embrace, clawing weakly at his throat while staring into those red eyes. 

Not Satan...not any of the ilk that dances in Pandemonium, but rather the devil of man&#39;s own surmise. A product of disbelief, of faith placed in science and probability. 

And Lancer&#39;s superior. 

Death subtly twitched against his neck, threatening to slice right into the vein that pulsed in his throat while Lancer gasped weakly for air. 

Illyn&#39;s words, his promise, pound against his temples as Lancer falls to his knee, the Servant bowing his head against the Demon and his invitation. A better world...

<em>That&#39;s not my name. It&#39;s-</em>

<em>OH! I am sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to just presume...I know it&#39;s a lot to put on one&#39;s shoulders. I know it&#39;s a lot to ask. But...I would feel honored if you did undertake it. Because no one but you can.</em> 

<em>The child pondered their next words slightly, looking about the shores that lay on the other side of turbulent waters that smashed and sprayed them both in salted foam. Reprobus himself was a bit annoyed at being left in the wake while the child was lost in his own mind.</em> 

<em>&quot;I...All I&#39;ve really wanted is to show people they have the strength to do right. That it&#39;s hard, but...it&#39;s worth it to be something for others to follow. Even if it means dying for it.&quot;</em> 

<em>To die for something...for a symbol. Lancer couldn&#39;t think of a worse waste of time...but coming from the child, it seemed to have an ear of respect. Who was this?</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Christopher pants heavily, and his muscles scream as he pushes himself back up, his arm shaking as it nearly grasped at an invisible stick to wave in The Demon&#39;s face, but instead it resolved to grasp onto the wispy tail that pressed deeper into his neck. His flesh sizzles upon contact as a horrid stench and coiling smoke rose from between his fingers as the heat broke through his leathered garb. 

&quot;Somehow...I just can&#39;t bring myself to trust a Demon and their Master...I&#39;m sorry, Illyn. Your promise is pretty worthless...I learned myself that something worth believing in is ultimately worth dying for...because even if I pass now...there&#39;s a few people out there in this war that may have the strength to stand against this promise. Humanity needs to improve? Well, maybe they do...but I think they&#39;re on their own path. They don&#39;t need your kind of help.&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s jaw unclenched, and  in another roiling belch of smoke, his mouth was seared as he bit into the tail around his neck. Wrapping his free arm around the length of the tail, Lancer brought the Demon close before delivering a powerful kick to their chest. The blow sends Laplace&#39;s Demon flying back like a yoyo briefly, before Lancer digs deep and pulls hard on the Demon&#39;s tail. The tight grip around his forearm combined with the searing heat illicit a horrible scream, muffled by the tail still burning the inside of his palate. Summoning all of his brace, Lancer pulls again, swinging the Demon over his body to slam them on top of Illyn. 

&quot;You think this is going to somehow be easier? Because what, you broke my stick? Don&#39;t you know how stories go when a Saint fights a demon?!&quot;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, July 9, 2023 2:39 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127642854383161486 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127642854383161486><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 9, 2023 11:50 AM">11:50 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The thought experiment that controlled the universe&#39;s thermodynamics. A being with absolute control over the mechanics of the universe itself. There were only two words to describe a being with such power: God, or the Devil.

And what was the Devil but a demon? 

Yet, this <em>power</em>. This absolute control over an individual item at this precise moment. The way that Rider simply deleted an item from existence... Atlas had chosen well when creating a method of prediction for its institution. Illyn himself suspected that even the Six Sources were unaware of the power they had once harnessed.

Yet Rider had elected to erase a staff, and not Lancer himself. Illyn gave his Servant a sideways glance, before rolling his eyes. &quot;You are entitled to your opinion. I respect your commitment to your ideals. Much like your staff, it is unneeded.  Return to the mass of Spiritrons from which you came.&quot;

Illyn didn&#39;t move as Lancer swung Rider towards him. Instead, he simply smiled and waved, as if Lancer was an aquaintance that Illyn would never see again. They had eaten biscuits together, and that was that.

&quot;We do know how the stories go. In fact, let&#39;s conclude it with a saying Laplace would say. Ah, <em>au revoir</em>?&quot;

Rider remained unfazed, however, and barely flinched from his assault. Did they feel no pain? Was pain yet another one of those useless qualities only a human would possess?

Or did Lancer simply failed to bite hard enough?

&#39;Not against <em>this</em> demon,&#39; Rider chirped. &#39;All you&#39;re doing is collecting empirical evidence. Evidence that I can present to you on a silver platter.&#39;

A flicker of red. A flutter of soft wings, generating a powerful draft that disturbed the stagnant air of the church. Rider soared. They carried Lancer with them—a diminutive star burdened with an absurdly large weight—before slamming the Saint into the center of the crucifix. As the statue fell on top of him, Rider unfurled their Noble Phantasm a second time.

The weight of the crucifix pressed upon Lancer. It surpassed the burden he had carried across the river, transcended the romanticized weight of his sins. There was nothing metaphorical about it; the sheer material mass of the cross had simply grown far beyond what his Strength parameter could contend with. A tangible force intent on crushing him beneath its unyielding weight.

&#39;Do I really have to say goodbye?&#39; Rider pouted at Illyn as they perched atop the cross. &#39;He&#39;s the last visitor we&#39;ll have for the rest of the day.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128409990626029588 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128409990626029588><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 11, 2023 2:38 PM">2:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="killer6882">@KilleroftheSheets</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His body slammed and broke the floorboards beneath him, and he didn&#39;t have even a moment to languish in the pain before Christ themselves descended upon him. 

The painted copper pressed into his waist, and a sharp gasp pressed itself from his deflating body as Christopher felt an immeasurable weight. Greater than the world, greater than the Christ child. On his back, the Saint could only claw helplessly as the crucifix dug into his waist, his bones fractured and splitting while a deep gash from the from the crown of thorns sliced open his very belly. His breath came quick and short, interrupted by belches of blood that seeped from the corners of his muzzle and nose. 

But even now he fought. Weakly, feebly, and perhaps pathetically. But he fought, reaching aimlessly for Rider in the chances to catch even one tiny piece of him to rip away. Was this fate? To die pitifully? Was this his true purpose? To die for some plan to forge humanity? 

&quot;<em>Kkkkkeeeeh...</em>This....this can&#39;t be h-how it....eeeends.&quot; 

Each breath brought with it a cloying gasp, the slight gurgle of death and blood arising from a strangled throat as Lancer&#39;s hands slid meekly over the crucifix, blood streaking in trails over the body of his very Master. His body shivered, grasped by the chill that came from the loss of feeling in his lower extremities. His teeth bared and ground together as he fought to hold onto the feeling, to hang onto the shards of bone that were starting to splinter from his shins and femurs. But this too passed, and tears welled in the beast&#39;s eyes as the last feeling of his own crushed torso faded away. 

<em>&quot;What&#39;d you say your name was again?&quot;</em> 

<em>The child, having been briefly lost in trying to think of the best way to convince Christopher, found himself smiling brightly at the question.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128542160287957084 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128542160287957084><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 11, 2023 11:23 PM">11:23 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

His eyes dulled as another cough wracked him, blood spraying against the feet of Laplace&#39;s Demon, as well as the crest of Christ himself. Lancer&#39;s head fell softly against the floor, giving the man a clear view of Illyn himself.

I&#39;m not a visitor, but I&#39;m something more. Be patient.&quot; Illyn told his Servant before turning to Lancer.

&quot;Enough.&quot; Illyn said simply as he took a knee, confident in his safety. If Christopher tried anything, Laplace&#39;s Demon would intercept, and end his existence with a thought. As a former martyr, Illyn was confident in Christopher&#39;s understanding of this fact. In a way, this was a simple experiment with the boundaries carefully established.

&quot;I will twist your question slightly. Forgive me.&quot; Illyn coughed into his fist. &quot;I&#39;m aware that he was the one who ruled over Christians and pagans with an iron fist in an attempt to maintain the old ways. He was a fool who approached the situation like a brute. When you clean up something, whether it be in a lab or otherwise, you carefully separate the materials before disposing of them in different locations, lest you cause a chemical spill.&quot;

Illyn scoffed for a moment as he considered the question, before continuing.

&quot;You do not... <strong>hamfistedly smash everything and toss it into a trash compacter.</strong> Materials that do little on their own will often meld and merge into a dangerous mixture. Sometimes, it explodes in a fiery ball. You&#39;re familiar with those. It is only when faced with carelessness and a lack of understanding that such an event can occur. Martyrs are similar. When Decius burned you and your followers alive, he <strong>immortalized</strong> you. He put you here now. If that&#39;s an act of God, you&#39;re here now.&quot;

&quot;In a twisted way, his cruelty birthed you. He made a demon, but also a saint. Just like Pierre-Simon Laplace created that little shit over there.&quot; 

Illyn gestured towards his Servant.

Jesus Christ bore deeper into him, gouging his simulated intestinal tract as bits of his origin faded into the air around them. Well...there really wasn&#39;t much more to do now besides talk. No matter how much he might have pleaded God...this was indeed it. His final run. 

&quot;<em>pant pant</em>...great. I get stuck with some alcohol soaked pessimist...and now I have to listen to some man break things down like a machine. Worst part is you&#39;re the only one who could even tell me my story...&quot; 

He had resigned himself to being forgotten. A footnote in a long line of martyrs and Servants of the gospel of Paradise. But fate has other ideas...maybe that really is all that&#39;s befitting of one that served Satan himself. Maybe this was all the use he could provide...just a dead corpse. 

&quot;I suppose murdering nuns is just &#39;cleaning up the lab&#39; then, is that right? Is that what you&#39;re-KACK&quot; 

The bite dissipated as Lancer felt the cross sink even lower, crushing and congealing his organs to slurry that brought on another bout of wracking coughs. He didn&#39;t have time for this. 

&quot;...Maybe that&#39;s just what this is all about. Maybe I&#39;m just always meant to die.

The crushing weight was only matched by the sinking of his mind, Lancer not even gathering the strength anymore to look at either Rider or Illyn. This was all pointless...his whole existence pointless, wasted.

If that number is zero, then the hens will love us. If that number is larger, I will personally bring the hammer into the henhouse with me. It&#39;s not my fault that we&#39;re better than you.&quot;  

&quot;Do not take this as arrogance or delusion. It is nothing of the sort.&quot; Illyn shrugged as he scratched his chin. It wasn&#39;t even a tone of arrogance. Illyn&#39;s voice was flat, as if he was stating a simple fact about the world. He truly believed that he and Rider could outpace Lancer. &quot;We&#39;ll eliminate the negative bias of fate from the equation known as life.&quot;

Killing Rosula and the various Church staff had not been desirable. Illyn was not proud of that act. It was something that Rider had deemed relevant to his calculations, and as Atlas&#39;s processor, who was Illyn to doubt him? He doubted. He criticized. He experimented. At the end of it all, a new hypothesis would be made.

&quot;<strong>I hate pity.</strong>&quot; Illyn stood up and looked down at Lancer. &quot;<strong>Stand up.</strong> One more strike. Try to hit me. Saint Christopher would never fold without one last strike. I would never give up on my ambitions, so neither should you.&quot;

Lancer didn&#39;t have much juice left in him. Yet to see such pity caused Illyn&#39;s gut to squirm with disgust. He had come back from death a dozen times, and continued to march towards his beliefs. To see another do the same was an insult towards Illyn&#39;s commitment, and towards a notion of martyrdom as a whole.

Christopher would feel Illyn&#39;s breath on his neck as Illyn hissed at him. His breath smelled like sand and life and shame and potential and mangoes. &quot;<em>Do not return to the Throne a coward. Hit me. My Servant will kill you, but you won&#39;t disgrace your name. Do not make my calculations incorrect. Hit. Me.</em>&quot;

&quot;<em>Do it.</em>&quot;

The order had the pull of a Command seal, pushing Lancer to retaliate by once more flexing the strength of the world. The crucifix moaned, briefly, even moving very slightly from the burst of strength. The wood creaked as it lifted a bare centimeter, nothing short of a feat considering Lancer shouldn&#39;t have been able to move the structure at all. Of course, faith, devotion and anger can only take one so far, as no sooner had Lancer been swept up in the rage of Reprobus did he fall back into the despair, as the thorns sank back into his wound, their piercing not even felt through the icy numbness that populated his lower half. 

He couldn&#39;t fight back. Even though he wanted to, desperately wanted to...he couldn&#39;t. The strength simply wasn&#39;t there. The same shame that slunk through each of Illyn&#39;s sarcastic wit heated Lancer&#39;s face, leaving it the only thing left to feel and anchor him to the world. 

<em>Hit. Me.</em> 

He had been here before. 

<em>If your God is real, if he is so powerful, than break through those restraints. Kill me now, you beast.</em> 

He&#39;d been jeered at the very same. 

<em>Do not sully my chambers by turning the other cheek. Are you not a man? Are you not the warrior your legends told me of? What are you waiting for, hit me!</em> 

&quot;...No. No, I...I won&#39;t.&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s voice was hoarse, despite the blood that still seeped from the corners of his jaws. His body ached and the heat in his face stretched towards his eyes, as tears slowly welled within. He wouldn&#39;t have been caught dead crying anywhere else, but the situation was so futile, so pathetic...and more than anything, liberating. 

&quot;...What&#39;s wrong with pity?&quot; He asked, his chest deflating as he felt the end drawing near. He had minutes...seconds at worst.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But even with the world&#39;s end, with his eyesight dimming and the taste of the modern air dwindling away, he couldn&#39;t help but feel...free. 

&quot;I pity you, Illyn. I pity you, Ruler. If nothing else...I pity what you must have gone through to get here. It must have been a lot...you have the pity of a Saint...doesn&#39;t that amount to anything for you?&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s arms fell, splayed out at his side, the feeling in his fingers gone as he focused intently on the morning sun peering through the hole above. 

<em>I&#39;m a Christian. In the end, I&#39;m not going to fight...not when I can help you see. Decius...you have my pity. Maybe it&#39;s enough...maybe it&#39;s not. But know that in this moment, I don&#39;t hate you. My Master wouldn&#39;t forgive me if I did.</em> 

&quot;I&#39;m a Christian. In the end, I&#39;m not going to fight. Not when...well, not when it&#39;s ultimately pointless. Fate is in their hands. Illyn and Ruler...you have my pity. If you&#39;re going to save the world, save humanity or however you put it...well, I hope it&#39;s all the best. I can only feel a bit sad if it&#39;s going to be paved with red. You don&#39;t know the answer...I guess thats the part I&#39;m most saddened by. I don&#39;t agree with this...but know that in this moment, I don&#39;t hate you.

I acknowledge and respect your opinion on it, but I prefer my opinion to yours. You understand, I sure.&quot; Illyn looked over at Ruler, before turning back to Christopher, eyes hard as steel. He stared into Christopher&#39;s soul, and it stared back.

His gaze was still inhuman. It was the result of numerous deaths and accidents. Nobody should have to suffer execution more than once. In that way, Illyn was like a Servant in this Holy Grail War. His Grail was his mission. Yet Christopher had found purpose beyond the Grail. He had found something <em>more</em>.

No. He had always had it.

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Illyn continued to stare down at Lancer. There was an unshakeable air there. Lancer had chosen a path not taken, yet taken all the same. Illyn had been faced with a predestined path, yet wasn&#39;t he now chasing a different one? If he had been in Lancer&#39;s shoes, would he fight against his opponent, his Decius, in this way?

Yes.

&quot;Hmph.&quot; His eyes softened slightly. 

<strong>CLANG!</strong> IBM hit the floor again as it opened up. Illyn reached out his hand as a weapon manifested from its depths. It was no Noble Phantasm. It wasn&#39;t even remotely close to the genuine article, but it was the schematic of a weapon Illyn had seen used before.

A long blade, belonging to a certain Rider of the Wheel.

&quot;At the end of this formula, we will find an answer that suits our needs. Thank you for your concern. May you find something more on another plane.&quot;

Illyn lifted the sword to Lancer&#39;s neck. A small line of blood dripped down. Lancer was a Servant, but he was finished either way. Even a human could finish him now.

&quot;Are those your last words? I will proceed with issuing the final rites.&quot; Illyn&#39;s voice was cold, but there was something <em>more</em> to it. Respect. Disgust. Admiration. Scorn. Something like that, and something far more.

Lancer almost felt a pang of gratefulness; it might actually be far more painful to die from his wounds like this, as a wreck. 

Even so, Lancer did think back to what he could say. Was he afraid to die? Well, no. He did it once already...it wasn&#39;t so bad. Especially when he left behind something a bit more decent...but what about now? When what he may leave behind is a troubled man and their impossibly powered Rider to cause a mass of destruction? Well, if he could shrug he would. The symbolism currently pinning him down from acting wasn&#39;t lost on him, after all. 

&quot;Yeah, I may have somethin...I served the strongest. And it took me this lifetime to realize...maybe that&#39;s what separates the strong from the weak. However you want to define or take that, im...a little delirious, I&#39;ll be honest. More than anything...I hope...humanity is in good hands. You know what I&#39;m the Saint of? The sister didn&#39;t know...the Saint of Travelers. And for this war...I did a pretty crappy job. But oh well. There&#39;s always next time...and maybe then, I&#39;ll learn this same lesson again. It takes true strength to decide on your own...to lead yourself.&quot; 

<em>I don&#39;t know if I can do that...You&#39;re asking-</em>

<em>I know it&#39;s a lot. But I know you.</em> 

<em>you know what I&#39;ve done, then?</em> 

<em>Well, nobody&#39;s perfect. I died precisely for that reason. I suspect you&#39;ll die as well for that reason. But ultimately, all we can do...I die smiling, and allowing forgiveness to enter. Teach by changing, Christopher. If not you, then who would do it?</em> 

&quot;Right...Teach by changing...it may be too late, but an example is an example.&quot; 

Lancer&#39;s eyes roll slowly back to Illyn, as a smile creases rhe corners of his muzzle. 

&quot;I hope your experiment works out. If not, well...I guess I&#39;ll see the aftermath someday. I&#39;ll be there to bless the travel</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132046122827927613 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132046122827927613><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 21, 2023 3:27 PM">3:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="magnetm">@8 Ball</span> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The sword made a sound as it sliced through air. 

<strong>Shink!</strong>

<strong>Thud.</strong>

Illyn looked down at his foot as Lancer&#39;s head rolled towards it. Blood leaked from the neck wound. As quickly as blood flowed out, it turned into spiritrons. These would fuel the Holy Grail and create the wish that all lusted after.

The blood of a saint. Who knew what it was capable of? Now, it was worthless. In Illyn&#39;s eyes, it was no more important a substance than water.

&quot;Our path was not a mistake. We have never made a mistake. This is all going according to plan.&quot; Illyn murmured as he nudged the head away with his foot.

It was not time to change.

&quot;Are you satisfied, Rider?&quot; Illyn asked Laplace&#39;s Demon as he turned his head. &quot;Did you accumulate data from this experience about the humans you once observed?&quot;
