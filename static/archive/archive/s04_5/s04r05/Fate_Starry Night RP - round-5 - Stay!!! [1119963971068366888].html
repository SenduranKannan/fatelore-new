In the dream he was woken up by Griffin. Griffin demanded how much longer he planned on sleeping, but there was no homework, no meetings, no enemies crawling through windows and stabbing him in the thigh, absolutely nothing worth getting up for. So, in response, Lachlan simply uttered, <em>&#39;Five more minutes,&#39;</em> and drifted back to sleep on that peaceful, uneventful morning.

Except that he could not go back to sleep.

So here he was.

Lachlan set his mug down on the floor. A spoonful of salt and seven spoonfuls of sugar made for a foul drink, but he drank it anyway to replenish some much-needed electrolytes. Then he munched on painkillers like candy. 

As expected, they didn&#39;t yield the desired effect. At most, they clouded his mind and buzzed his thoughts enough so that he didn&#39;t have to think about the hard stuff. It was escapism at its finest.

His mind had finally quieted down, but now it felt unnaturally quiet. Lachlan hadn&#39;t realized how busy his mind had been while Pyg, the Dancer, Leapfrog...while <em>everyone</em> constantly flooded it with their own thoughts, forcing him to keep himself awake. The constant distractions left him with no space, no <em>patience</em>, for anything else. However, with most of Pyg&#39;s brains removed and the other puppets temporarily disabled, their presence had vanished, leaving behind a void.

He didn&#39;t know how to fill that void.

How alien his own mind felt. Now that he had the extra capacity to think, it scared him. His thoughts ran rampant, jumping from one neural pathway to another, playing and replaying past events over, and over, and over, and <strong>*over</strong>...*

He gripped the scissor in his hand hard and thrust it down.

The creature remained motionless, sprawled on all fours on the floor. Its brains had been temporarily removed from its body, rendering it completely inert and unresponsive to external stimuli. This near-vegetative state made the creature far easier to operate on—which was precisely what Lachlan had set out to do on this peaceful, uneventful morning.

He broke his toy. And now he had no choice but to fix it himself.

Well, technically, it was Bill who had taken the shots. But Lachlan was the one who had provided Bill with the crucial information on where to shoot—

No, <em>technically</em>, it was Roland who had coaxed that information out of him, while Bill executed the action. It was a joint effort from the two of them, exploiting Lachlan while he was under Pyg&#39;s influence and unable to make informed choices. They could have simply left him alone and waited for him to recover on his own, and he very well <em>could do it</em>. He could have regained control over Pyg given time. There was no doubt about it.

Bill and Roland had conspired against him.

Then they did it again, almost causing him his life in that fight against the man with the Mystic Eyes. How convenient of them to leave him exposed when he was at his weakest, only to reappear, magically, <em>simultaneously</em>, when the storm had nearly passed? How long had they been buddying up behind his back? 

The unsettling stillness in his mind only amplified his doubts. It made him feel sick—

<em>SNAP</em>

It took him a few seconds to realize that he had somehow, miraculous, broken the enhanced scissor and left the blade embedded in Pyg&#39;s flesh. The stitches he had completed just recently became undone, and now old wounds mixed with the new, as viscous blood seeped from the openings.

Something cold then ran across his fingers as he now felt a handle in his palm. Strong and wide, not to mention familiar. The handsaw no doubt.

&quot;Yer making a mess.&quot; Bill grumbled, watching the miniature fountain of blood that had gathered thanks to Lachlan&#39;s mistake. Normally, this would elicit a bit of humor. Some ill-natured taunts. A joke here and there. This time, however, Archer just frowned. It was easy for him to put two and two together, to realize that Lachlan&#39;s sloppiness was the product of the past: Old wounds, lackluster sleep and a close encounter with death at least three times now. That was enough to get grown men to shiver, nevermind Lachlan.

Of course, Bill didn&#39;t realize why Lachlan felt so distant and out of there. He himself had too much on his mind, still thinking about the encounter with Assassin and James. He&#39;d never admit it, but he felt directly responsible for that, like a bullet that had left its mark.

&quot;Why ya looking like ya saw a ghost? I told ya I&#39;d be here.&quot; Bill asked, raising an eyebrow at Lachlan&#39;s pale expression. He had already promised his Master that he would keep an eye on him at all times, especially after the James incident. It was rare for lightning to strike twice, but he&#39;d rather not tempt that fate.

&quot;Ya angry I don&#39;t look like Roland? Bah.&quot; He gave a brief laugh, before turning his head. &quot;C&#39;mere then, Roland. Yer wife wants ya.&quot; He snapped his fingers, taunting the butler. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead, he accepted the tool normally, maintaining his composure like a civilized human being.

<em>Why are you here?</em> He swallowed that question as well, as Bill&#39;s own question caught him off guard. Reluctantly, he dug up the memory of Archer making that passing remark as he got ready to head to his Workshop. 

God, he hated how <em>functional</em> his memory was right now.

Bill was right: he had indeed offered to be here, and Lachlan must have been too shocked by the nature of that remark that he had dismissed Bill&#39;s offer immediately.

Nevertheless, here he stood.

Following the snap of Bill&#39;s fingers, Lachlan&#39;s gaze landed on Roland, who was busy wrestling with Leapfrog&#39;s tangle of limbs. The blonde had been assigned the task of stapling the scars shut on Leapfrog&#39;s skin, but it seemed that the puppet was rather uncooperative and putting up quite a struggle, akin to that of a kitty who was having its nails trimmed.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Being used as a horse seemed to have affected the puppet&#39;s psyche, since it was acting like such a pain in the butt that it could <em>only</em> be considered a horse at this point.

In that case, he felt tempted to offer some advice, only to be interrupted by Lachlan: A deadpan stare, followed by a treacherous question that was designed to incite or tear down. The Dowling classic.

<strong>&quot;I&#39;d tell you to kill yourself.&quot;</strong> Bill replied, bluntly. &quot;&#39;Cause it&#39;d be a lot less painful that whatever I&#39;d do to people talking to me like that.&quot; He grinned, teeth showing through the mask like someone pulling out a golden smile to hide any stench of bloodlust. There it was. That boiling point. The punchline into a full outburst would come soon-

&quot;-Eh, I&#39;m just messin&#39; with ya. Lighten up!&quot; Lachlan felt a slap land on his back, one that was soft, yet painful due to the injuries he had sustained earlier.

&quot;Ya asked me to do worse when ya first summoned me. I had to grab stuff from a lake while butt naked in the snow. What makes you think right now would be any different?&quot; Bill asked, almost as if he was oblivious to the past few weeks. Or maybe he was just trying to bury them, hiding them in dark archives beyond Lachlan&#39;s reach. Or maybe he was just acting professional. Buddy buddy. Romantic. Whatever would get him on good terms with Lachlan after the most recent spat. After all, it was obvious that Bill was a Servant summoned by the Grail, and would therefore resort to anything possible in order to obtain it. Even if that meant swallowing his pride to obey Lachlan&#39;s commands.

Yes. That was most certainly it. Archer radiated no warmth, after all. Just an endless string of tantrums and suspicions. If anything, the tantrums were proof that he wasn&#39;t being fully honest. What a slimy Servant.

&quot;-Since you asked though.&quot; Bill kept talking, breaking Lachlan&#39;s list of theories. &quot;Are ya feeling alright? That stuff back at the hotel seemed rough. Ya better not be planning on dying on me from overwork or something.&quot; He warned with a scowl.

&quot;If that&#39;s the case, just let him work himself to death instead. He loves it!&quot; Bill immediately pointed back to Roland, throwing him under the bus. &quot;Oi, pipsqueak.

The words that spilled from Bill&#39;s mouth was pure venom; not that Lachlan had expected anything <em>less</em>, considering their tumultuous history and accumulated animosity towards each other. It was a miracle that Bill hadn&#39;t already murdered him in his sleep.

Perhaps that was why Bill felt the obligation to lay into him with words. Lachlan waited for the man to finish, gradually collecting all the ammunition he needed for his own retorts. He mustered all the self-control he had, trying not to immediately bare his fangs as he attempted to string together a composed reply. Perhaps a mention of the Command Spells he still possessed, just to remind him who held the leash in this relationship...

However, nothing could have prepared him for what came next. Lachlan parted his lips, an insult teetering on the edge of his tongue...only to swallow it back into his stomach as Bill unexpectedly slapped him on the back, accompanied by a complete U-turn in attitude.

Lachlan&#39;s attempt to speak was met with a fit of coughing as he choked on his own words. What game was Bill playing at? His eyes twitched as he struggled to make sense of things. Was he still trapped in a dream, or worse, succumbing to daytime hallucinations?

The stinging pain across his back, however, told him otherwise.

&#39;Is this your peculiar way of asking when you&#39;ll be rid of me?&#39; Lachlan chose his words carefully, masking his confusion with suspicion. &#39;Well, I hate to disappoint you, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be going anywhere anytime soon without some assistance. That is, unless someone decides to lend a hand and give the final push to do me in, of course...&#39;

He was all too startled to see Bill assume command and start barking orders to Roland, assigning him his own tasks. Suspicion turned into indignation; Lachlan drew himself up and grabbed Bill by the wrist.

Roland coughed pointedly, creating an awkward silence.

He was a simple minded fool, thinking that his words could be read in only one way, that he had been blunt enough for Lachlan to understand him. Instead, the complete opposite had happened, with the Dowling perceiving a completely different intent from the Archer&#39;s voice and actions. In fact, actions spoke the loudest, as the Master saw his &#39;Servant&#39; start ordering people around. The puppet was walking far beyond its strings.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Bill spat, feeling Lachlan grip his wrist and forcibly pull it down. His first instinct was to snap back, and maybe snap Lachlan&#39;s wrist too while he was at it, but he kept it down. The boy had been through a lot, all because of him too. No wonder they were acting agitated like a stray dog that had known nothing but kicks.

&quot;I get it, I get it. Ya did the same shit too back in the car.&quot; Bill pointed out, reminiscing that day. &quot;Didn&#39;t want my angel&#39;s touch. Insisted on doing the sewing yourself.&quot; He giggled, rubbing his fingers as he imitated the act of threading a needle.

&quot;But ya gotta understand that yer spreadin&#39; yerself thin. When was the last time ya got a proper rest? We&#39;ve been running non stop ever since that graveyard.&quot; Archer pointed out. Indeed, it was true that they had faced several opponents in the span of a few days. It was a Holy Grail War, after all. But to an outlaw like Bill, such a concept was ridiculous and foreign: No gang could last if they kept getting into altercations with the sheriff every day. That&#39;s why his Cherokee brothers were so important; they gave him safe haven when he needed it the most. Lachlan didn&#39;t have that type of haven. So the least Bill could do was attempt to replicate that with his own services.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119964889549639680 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119964889549639680><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 7:20 AM">7:20 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Before he could continue with more sagely wisdom, Roland interjected with a very simple solution: If Bill cared about Lachlan&#39;s well-being that much, he could simply get to work himself.

Almost instinctively, Bill shook his head, as if saying &#39;no&#39;.

&quot;I&#39;m not a freak like you two!&quot; Pot shouted, calling out the kettles. &quot;I know none of this voodoo bullshit, plus ya didn&#39;t even trust me with sewing you, nevermind sewing a bunch of beasts and monsters together. I can&#39;t even tell if that guy&#39;s head is a butt or not!&quot; He pointed at Leapfrog. The horse&#39;s head did look very round, now that Lachlan thought about it.

&quot;Ya need something to get shot at? I&#39;m the man. I end lives, I don&#39;t save &#39;em.&quot; Bill added, just to further reinforce his point. &quot;We can just take it easy and do it tomorrow.

Surprisingly, it was Roland who decided to speak up first, stunning Lachlan into silence. Lachlan narrowed his eyes at Roland, as if questioning his intent, but Roland simply raised his arm, and—

<em><strong>snap!</strong></em>

—stapled another wound shut on Leapfrog&#39;s lacerated skin.

&#39;I didn&#39;t sign up to watch you slowly kill yourself,&#39; Roland said sincerely. &#39;Remember when you insisted you had common sense? Told me to get some sleep so I could drive without crashing us all into the roadside? Well...&#39; He raised the stapler again, waving it around like a conductor&#39;s baton.

&#39;I can say the same to you. Your body&#39;s going to crash first if you don&#39;t learn to unwind.&#39;

<em><strong>snap!</strong></em>

He shot another staple into Leapfrog.

Leapfrog butted Roland in the ribs, causing the blonde to loosen his grip. The puppet then darted away, and Roland, with a sigh, gave chase.

&#39;The <em>point</em> is,&#39; He continued to speak—which was more like yelling now—between strides. &#39;None of this is going anywhere if you just bury yourself in work. The Holy Grail War is far from over. The Sister at the Church made that clear to me. What happened to that patience you had when we first arrived?&#39;

He stopped in front of Lachlan and Bill. Fumbled in his pants pocket, and produced a car key.

&#39;Do it, even if not for me, then for yourself.&#39; He nudged the key into the puppeteer&#39;s hands. &#39;Unless you enjoy watching Archer ruin your puppets with his crude stitches...&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Together, Roland and Bill&#39;s words struck him like a one-two punch. This was precisely why Lachlan never liked the idea of being told what to do. It made him question his own senses, sowed his own self-doubt. It set him on a path of self-pity, trapped him in a vicious feedback loop. A decision was a decision, even if it was a bad one; when he made a decision, he wanted to stick with it.

Except that this time, his body failed to keep up. The pill bottles, the energy drinks, he had resorted to abusing chemicals to keep himself running. Even Bill, the very last person he&#39;d expected to show consideration, was fussing over him. 

It made him feel sick.

It made him feel sick that their words <em>made sense</em>.

&#39;Thought it was your duty to make sure I don&#39;t exhaust myself. Make up for that deficit. Isn&#39;t that what being a <em>servant</em> entails?&#39; He bristled at them both. But without any substance to back up his insults, they fell flat, and Lachlan felt foolish for even allowing himself to be baited into the argument.

Furiously, he chose to embrace silence.

Strategically avoiding both Bill and Roland&#39;s stares, Lachlan turned his attention back to Pyg. He began to vent his anger by grinding the handsaw into Pyg&#39;s thick skin.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119964927571009626 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119964927571009626><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 7:20 AM">7:20 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was large, quiet and relatively hidden, which also meant that any sound in it was so enhanced that it almost felt like an echo. Roland&#39;s words would have sounded like a pebble outside, but right now they were like an avalanche, drowning Lachlan with their logic and reason.

He admitted defeat, to the point even Bill was impressed. There were dogs and slaves, and then there was whatever Roland was: A slave so trusted that even its owner had to acquiesce.

&quot;Uncalled for.&quot; Bill replied, almost as if joking as Roland threw him under the bus for mocking his sewing skills. Lachlan was not amused, instead turning to Bill with a face that expressed disgust. His words weren&#39;t kind either.

Bill replied in kind, giving him a glare that straight up said <em>&#39;piss off&#39;</em>, but he didn&#39;t say it of course. Instead, he just shrugged. &quot;Aye aye, boss. Just listen to the man.&quot; He pointed to Roland, but received no response as Lachlan went back to Pyg&#39;s carcass, slicing it up in a way that felt like a coping mechanism more than a surgical procedure.

With Lachlan distracted, Bill took this as the perfect opportunity to head to Roland and extend his hand out.

&quot;Gimme the keys. I&#39;ll just drive him back to the hotel or something. He can&#39;t say no to me if I just drag him out.&quot; Archer giggled, knowing that not even Lachlan would be stupid enough to waste a Command Spell on preventing that. Roland would concur, though what he didn&#39;t expect was Bill refocusing his attention back on him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1119964986580668446 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1119964986580668446><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 18, 2023 7:21 AM">7:21 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;I gotta say though,&quot; The cowboy spoke. &quot;ya really knew which buttons to push, huh? I guess ya were calling half of the shots after all.&quot; Bill tipped his hat, almost as if acknowledging Roland as more than just another passerby. More like someone on the same footing as his Master.

&quot;Heheheh. I knew my eyes didn&#39;t lie.&quot; Bill chuckled, raising his index and wiggling it. &quot;On that night, I didn&#39;t just imagine it. You really did shoot first.&quot; He added, causing Roland to feel a shiver on the back of his neck.

After all, he had expected this outcome—not because he possessed any special insight, but simply because he had worked alongside Lachlan for so long that he had become intimately familiar with his moods and temperament. Lachlan prioritized rationality above all else, despite occasionally succumbing to impulsive outbursts himself; all he had to do was nudge the puppeteer with a well-constructed argument from time to time, so that Lachlan had no choice but to accept them grudgingly.

Thus, Roland was all prepared for the next stage of the plan: employing gentle persuasion by positioning himself <em>beneath</em> Lachlan and speaking to him in soothing tones until the puppeteer complied.

But Bill threw a wrench in his plan. Instead of focusing on Lachlan, the Cowboy instead decided to confront Roland himself. He placed Roland on a pedestal, showering him with approval that left the blonde feeling...

As if...

Roland instinctively placed his palm on Bill&#39;s chest and pushed him as far away as his muscles allowed, shaking his head in disbelief.

&#39;Don&#39;t!&#39; He hissed, barely out of earshot of Lachlan. &#39;I&#39;m only doing this for Lachy&#39;s own good! Don&#39;t twist my words!&#39;

His cheeks flushed pink despite his words. His embarrassment was evident as Bill laid on the compliments. What was Bill doing?! The last thing he wanted was to sow discord between himself and Lachlan!

&#39;I&#39;m just doing my job,&#39; Roland declared firmly. &#39;Lachy is the one in charge.

He almost did that with Roland, before the boy started stammering about him getting them into trouble. Really, <em>him?</em> The claim was so ridiculous that he was far too stunned to ever take out the pistol.

&quot;...The hell are ya sweating for?&quot; Bill asked, confused with an eyebrow raised. &quot;But hey, glad the boss got such a good friend in ya.&quot; He joked, Roland wondering whether the cowboy was being sincere or not. He could never really tell with the various moody episodes that Bill had. Lachlan was threatening, but he wore his emotions clearly, regardless of how well he tried to hide them. Bill, on the other hand, jumped from happy to furious faster than a jackrabbit. 

&quot;Don&#39;t think I forgot about yesterday.&quot; Almost as if aware of his own stereotype, Bill immediately referred to the only event that Lachlan could view under an objective lens: The encounter at the arcade had lit up a spark in both of them, undoing the thick fog in their lenses and finally letting them see a bigger picture. The mirror was gradually showing its glowing sheen.

&quot;I&#39;m just messin&#39; around with ya, so calm yer tits. Besides, don&#39;t get me wrong: Lachlan is still my boss.&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, coughing a bit as he realized he needed to adjust himself.

<em>&quot;Our</em> boss, since you seem to love him so freakin&#39; much.&quot; He scoffed. &quot;So don&#39;t worry. What you can do, the boss can probably do a hundred times better. See, happy now?&quot; He taunted, mocking Roland&#39;s own insecurities in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It was hurtful, but it didn&#39;t seem like Bill was trying to harm him, more so poke bullet holes in his attitude. Was this a poor attempt at &#39;pep talk&#39;?

What happened while he was asleep? Had another soul taken over Bill&#39;s body, or had Bill decided to become a changed man? This abrupt shift in demeanor left Roland dumbfounded, until the cowboy finally let slip his intentions...

Roland sighed. He cast a glance at Lachlan, secretly glad—and simultaneously amazed—by the puppeteer&#39;s ability to completely tune out the world around him at will. It was a skill that seemed almost inhuman, but one that worked to Roland&#39;s advantage all the same.

Taking his chances, Roland squared his shoulders and leveled Bill with the most unerring stare, until Bill started feeling self-conscious. There wasn&#39;t anything on his face, was there?

&#39;What happened to driving <em>our</em> boss back?&#39; Roland mouthed his words quietly, dangling the car keys that Lachlan had refused to take. &#39;Playing dumb won&#39;t work with me. Remember, I grew up with siblings.&#39;

He bonked the Archer with the key.

&#39;Go on, leave then.&#39; He motioned Bill away, not buying into his attempt to curry favor. &#39;Use those two capable hands of yours to steer the wheel safely. Don&#39;t run any red light, and make sure he gets some sleep.&#39; He raised an eyebrow. &#39;A Servant of your caliber should be capable of accomplishing that without resorting to tantrums or violence, right?&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 3:46 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121016048313958500 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121016048313958500><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 4:57 AM">4:57 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill remained silent, eyebrow raised as he was about to speak up, before Roland talked over him.

&quot;Oh. I guess I did say that, huh.&quot; Bill replied with a shrug, as if he had just caught himself in the act of following his impulses as usual. Old habits died hard, but Roland made sure to show that such an attitude would not be tolerated, slapping the keys on top of the Archer&#39;s hat.

&quot;Feh!&quot; Bill grunted, annoyed at the gesture, but not as much as Roland&#39;s suddenly bossy orders. The patience from earlier was gradually being replaced by irritation, especially since Roland was treating him like he was an incompetent oaf. He wondered where he had gotten that from.

&quot;Bah. Guess the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree, does it?&quot; The cowboy snarled, giving Roland a stink eye as his implication rung clear. &quot;Got it, boss. I&#39;ll make sure the <em>other</em> boss is well cared for.&quot; He twirled the keys around his fingers, rising up as he walked towards Lachlan, who was still dead focused on the meat. Anything to ignore the bickering of the two other idiots in the room.

&quot;Boss, nap time. C&#39;mon.&quot; Bill whistled, trying to catch Lachlan&#39;s attention with the rattling of keys. &quot;Need a bed? Some booze? A lady to-go?

So this is what he had to do in order to manage this pack of wolves, huh? Roland ran his fingers through his hair, suddenly feeling an intense urge to drink something cool.

The sound of metal teeth grinding against reinforced flesh filled his ears. The progress was agonizingly slow, but the act of sawing itself held more significance than the end result. Lachlan wanted to find solace in the repetitiveness of this simple motion; his arms grew increasingly sore, but he persisted, determined to exhaust himself in a futile attempt to release his pent-up frustration. So immersed was he in this pursuit of inner peace that the jingling of keys startled him completely, causing him to visibly jump.

Instinctively, he clapped his hands over his ears, feeling a surge of goosebumps travel up his arms. His shot Bill a sharp glare, which should by all means convey his desire to be left alone.

&#39;...I need to work.&#39; A weak excuse, fooling no one. But the puppeteer stubbornly asserted, even as he was on the verge of receiving a hand cramp. 

&#39;Leave me alone. Find something else to keep yourself busy.&#39; He turned away, so that neither Bill nor Roland could see his eyes twitch as he cringed as his own response. Despite the childishness of his response, he still refused to make nice...

Behind him, Roland rolled his eyes in exasperation. What was this, a kindergarten playground? Was Roland forever doomed to babysit a group of unruly children?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 5:19 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121189792965722245 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121189792965722245><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 4:27 PM">4:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Enough for Lachlan to be startled and reply with his trademark venomous tone.

&quot;Great Spirit, get over yerself.&quot; Bill groaned, having expected that sort of reaction, albeit for different reasons. He didn&#39;t know Lachlan deeply, but he knew for a fact that it was hard to reestablish trust after the past events. After all, what sort of excuse did Bill have anymore after his escapade? 

But Lachlan didn&#39;t react well to bootlicking. Neither did Bill, really. He could agree with the Dowling on that. That&#39;s why he decided for a much more brutish approach, moving towards Lachlan with the swagger of a cowboy as he wrapped his arm around the boy&#39;s shoulder and forcibly started to drag.

&quot;Keep myself busy? And do what, chop up meat? Hell no.&quot; Archer grumbled, grabbing at Lachlan&#39;s wrist in an effort to separate the man from saw. &quot;Ya know me. I&#39;d rather hang outside. But that would mean leaving my Master defenseless, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; He giggled.

&quot;So, if ya want me to keep myself busy, then sure. Just accept that you&#39;ll die today if some random Master decides to come knocking.&quot; Archer shrugged, pointing towards the building exit. &quot;It would be so easy too.

When Bill came a-knocking, even with minimal strength exerted, he still managed to part Lachlan from Pyg easily, like peeling the skin off a banana...

<em>clank</em>

The handsaw clattered to the floor. Lachlan sank both hands into Bill&#39;s arm, attempting to pry himself free.

&#39;God damn it,&#39; he growled, his voice muffled under the cowboy&#39;s sleeve. &#39;Let go. Don&#39;t make me force you—&#39;

But Bill had already started to drag him out. Lachlan couldn&#39;t do a thing as his shoes squeaked against the floor; his legs tripped over each other, and it was only thanks to Bill&#39;s shoulder &#39;support&#39; that he managed to remain somewhat upright.

Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Roland deliberately turning away, unwilling to confront the broad daylight kidnapping unfolding before him. Cursing under his breath, the puppeteer decided, as a last-ditch effort, to remain as uncooperative as possible. He stiffened his body, and made the escort job an absolute <em>chore</em>.

Bill had never been known for his patience. If Lachlan proved to be enough of a nuisance, then chances were high he would give up right here and now!</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, June 21, 2023 6:32 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Hmph.&quot; Bill just harrumphed at this display of defiance. No backtalk or insults were necessary to convey the annoyance in his tone. Instead of giving Lachlan the satisfaction of hearing an annoyed Archer, Bill proceeded to unceremoniously drop him on the floor. Had the idiot finally given up?

&quot;Mmmph.&quot; Bill murmured, crouching down as Lachlan felt the cowboy&#39;s arms reach for the man&#39;s legs, then his back. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as he was lifted up, realizing that Archer had decided to put him in a <strong>princess carry</strong> because of his stubbornness.

Bill kicked the door to the exit open, then immediately headed for the car and opened the door to the backseats. He tossed Lachlan in like he was in a body bag, then slammed the door shot. Lachlan would see his Servant reappear in the front, now seated in the driver&#39;s seat. The car started up soon after.

&quot;Buckle up.&quot; Bill warned, pointing towards the seatbelt. He then sped off, leaving the shadowed alley and basking in the hot Egyptian sun as they joined back into the island roads. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It wasn&#39;t until they were safely inside the car, shielded from prying eyes by the thick doors, that Lachlan&#39;s body began to thaw. Bill&#39;s safety warnings fell on deaf ears as he sat slouched in the backseat; perhaps he was replaying the nightmare he had just endured, or perhaps he was plotting the many ways he could make Bill pay for violating his human rights, or perhaps...

The car lurched forward. There was a sharp intake of breath as the puppeteer was thrown back, then immediately followed by a yelp as he rebounded and collided with the back of the front seat. Bill pressed down on the gas pedal as if his life depended on it, taking the car down the familiar lanes as scenery flew by in a blur. If Lachlan broke his neck due to the lack of seatbelts, then it would be his own fault!

<em>rattle rattle</em>

A shadowed loomed on the right, obstructing Bill&#39;s view. Soon, the space around him became constricted as well, as Lachlan appeared on top of the small armrest between the two front seats, and silently began to cram himself into the front.

With a fair bit of challenge, it seemed, since the car was still in motion. With each sharp turn, Bill received either an arm or an elbow to his face, followed by the puppeteer&#39;s weight pressing down on him and threatening to flatten him like a pancake.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, June 23, 2023 3:23 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121498333081509968 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121498333081509968><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 22, 2023 12:53 PM">12:53 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His Riding skill had transferred over to his ability to drive a car, much like how it was hard for someone to ever forget riding a bicycle. He knew this of course, but had never gotten the opportunity to fully immerse himself in driving. Quick swerves and turns, overtaking slower drivers and even honking the alarm whenever he felt like it. It was so damn liberating compared to riding a horse! The car obeyed his every command!

<em>&quot;This is fucking great. Why didn&#39;t they give me this shit earlier?!&quot;</em> Bill thought to himself, cursing Lachlan for hiding all the good stuff. He took a quick scan at the map on his lap and located their current position on it. Let&#39;s see here, the quickest route to the hotel-

&quot;Yo, you got your belt yet? Don&#39;t blame me if ya snap yer neck.&quot; Bill spat, hearing noise coming from behind. He didn&#39;t care to check, since he was too busy enjoying the ride.

Even Bill was startled.

&quot;Hey! Get back-&quot; He was about to shout, before he heard honking from in front of him. He was about to collide with another vehicle!

<em>STTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRR!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121547140792078427 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121547140792078427><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 22, 2023 4:07 PM">4:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
He made a rough swerve to the right, narrowly dodging the other driver, who flipped them off before leaving. Bill snarled at them right back, thinking about putting a gun in their ass crack before he received a slap from Lachlan&#39;s elbow. More honking soon followed as Bill had stopped his car in the middle of nowhere, attracting the attention of the rather speedy Berenice drivers. Most of them showered him in insults, asking him to stop clogging the area and get out of there.

...Had we really improved upon horses?

&quot;Shut the hell up!&quot; Bill opened the windshield just to shout that out, before doing a quick 180 and driving into a different, quieter road. Another elbow struck his face, causing him to speed up, then abruptly brake, sending Lachlan flying down to the back once again.

&quot;Can ya stop?! Yer making this more difficult than it has to be!&quot; Bill scolded the puppeteer, adjusting the mirror so that he could see Lachlan&#39;s monotone face better. &quot;Ya can do whatever ya want once we get back to the hotel, I don&#39;t care. But for now, stay <em>fucking</em> put.&quot;

If there was ever a time that Bill gave an order worth obeying, it would be now. Lachlan could sense the Servant&#39;s irritation and killing intent gradually rising, to the point he didn&#39;t know if it was worth it to tempt fate or not. Oh, fuck it. He might as well do it anyway.

He considered it, while Archer returned to the map and scratched the back of his head, trying to find a new route to the hotel now that they had been forced into a different path thanks to yours truly. This seemed like the perfect time to bother him some more, until the cowboy spoke up before Lachlan could even strike.

&quot;-Listen, I know there&#39;s prolly a lot going on that head of yours.&quot; Bill sounded a bit more composed, like he was actually trying to be heard for once. &quot;But we&#39;re still in this together. Me, you, and that Roland kid back at the slaughterhouse. We all want the Grail, right? So let&#39;s all just get along.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1121547178637271060 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1121547178637271060><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, June 22, 2023 4:08 PM">4:08 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Lachlan could feel something churning at his stomach. What the hell was Bill talking about? <em>Why</em> was he talking about this? Couldn&#39;t he tell how poorly timed this was after the whole disaster from a while back?

&quot;If there&#39;s anything on ya mind, just tell me. A gun is pointless without a gunslinger, so,&quot; The cowboy turned around, deigning to stare at Lachlan right in the eye. &quot;if my owner can&#39;t pull the trigger, I&#39;m really just a sorry ass gun.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill turned around and planted his face squarely in Lachlan&#39;s elbow. <em>Again.</em> Despite his warnings and the menacing aura he exuded, Lachlan had not, in fact, stayed put. The moment the car got caught in traffic, he reattempted his ascent to the front. And this time, he succeeded. 

With several fresh footprints all over the armrest and an additional one on Bill&#39;s thigh, the puppeteer settled into the passenger seat and buckled himself in.

&#39;It reeks back there. There, I&#39;ve said my piece.&#39; Lachlan muttered, still refusing to make eye contact and instead choosing to gaze out the window at the honking cars stuck in traffic. &#39;Didn&#39;t I tell you to always clean up after a meal?&#39;

He reached over for the radio, flicking it on blindly and switching to a channel that played some kind of Arabic pop. He propped his legs up on the dashboard and slumped lower in the seat to make himself more comfortable.

An awkward silence settled between them, only being salvaged by the janky beats of the radio. Meanwhile, the cars slowly inched forward. Somehow they had gotten themselves trapped in the morning rush, with cars heading out of the island and into Aswan proper for work. Lachlan glanced at the rearview mirror, watching the street vendors taking advantage of the traffic to approach the drivers, knocking on windows and attempting to sell their goods. 

Everything looked cramped, messy, chaotic. Yet, it felt normal—just a typical work day for the city&#39;s residents.

&#39;Look at them,&#39; Lachlan suddenly spoke up. &#39;Going about their days, unaware that their city is being turned into a slaughterhouse. How many more deaths do you reckon it&#39;ll take for them to realize they&#39;re being used as livestock by people like us?&#39;

Work on puppets and you&#39;ll move like one too, it seemed. Unlike an obedient puppet, however, Lachlan immediately cut Bill down by making a scathing remark at back seats, calling it a pigsty.

Bill sighed. &quot;Here we go again, the <em>bitch ass</em> treatment.&quot; The cowboy grumbled, recoiling from the elbow as he cast a shady side glance to his Master. &quot;All I&#39;m tryna do is help ya out. To help both of us out. But if ya ain&#39;t gonna listen to-&quot; Of course, Lachlan cut him off once more, waving away a wannabe car washer that offered to wipe their windscreens for a nickel. That act was insulting enough for Lachlan to start talking about the common masses and how little they mattered. Would these pawns even care if they were cut down where they stood?

Would Bill care?

<strong>&quot;Do ya need to ask?&quot;</strong> Bill replied quickly, most likely due to being annoyed at Lachlan cutting him off again. &quot;I&#39;d do it. In a minute too.&quot; He said without remorse, waving around and pointing at potential targets from left, right and center.

&quot;These people? They don&#39;t matter. Never ever mattered to me. Ya think I&#39;d even have a body count if I cared about how many people I shot down?&quot; Cherokee Bill laughed. Lachlan didn&#39;t need to be an expert on Americana to realize how much scorn and blood Archer&#39;s name brought.

It was as if the hammer had moved on its own, sensing the owner&#39;s bloodlust. &quot;-then I&#39;ll kill whoever I need to. I&#39;m sure ya&#39;d agree.&quot; He then turned to face Lachlan.

He was still pretty hung up on being &#39;manhandled&#39; earlier, it seemed. Understandable, considering he was completely sober this time.

Perhaps Bill had sensed Lachlan&#39;s dissatisfaction as well, as he didn&#39;t so much as flinch as the puppeteer treaded all over him, and was quick to respond to his dubious questions. That finally triggered some semblance of a genuine reaction from his passenger; Lachlan peeled his eyes away from the road for a moment, lingering around Bill&#39;s waist where the guns were holstered.

&#39;Really. Even if they&#39;ve done nothing to you?&#39; He quirked an eyebrow, sounding slightly amused. &#39;Even if they never crossed your path, never insulted your face, and never betrayed you? Your old boss...&#39; he tapped the window sill, &#39;If he told you put a bullet through someone you knew. Liked, even. Would you still do it?&#39;

Lachlan was studying the cowboy rather intently now, sharp as a scalpel. After a while he said, &#39;I&#39;m not here to hear you say what you <em>think</em> I want to hear,&#39; he reached over to turn up the volume of the radio. &#39;Right now, my mind is surprisingly devoid of junk, thanks to you doing a number on Pyg. I don&#39;t need to refill it with insincere drivel. Why don&#39;t you tell me a joke I haven&#39;t heard before?&#39; He issued the Archer a challenge. &#39;Maybe <em>that</em> is what I want to hear right now.

He saw those traits as something to be stepped on, more pavement to walk and advance in life. Bill felt like a fool for even trying, making a mental note to avoid this type of conversation in the future. Hell, not like he was good at sappy stuff either!

The conversation then shifted over to hypotheticals, with Lachlan deciding to amuse himself by asking Bill his own version of <em>Truth or Dare</em>. Bill replied in earnest, only for Lachlan to probe further down. He didn&#39;t seem satisfied by the response.

&quot;Again, do ya really need to ask?&quot; Bill scoffed. &quot;If my boss asked me to kill someone like my mother or my sister, then I&#39;d say no. That&#39;s strike one. If they asked me again, I&#39;d shoot one of their eyes out. That&#39;s strike two. I don&#39;t think I need to explain strike three.&quot; The cowboy groaned, counting up with his fingers. He took notice of Lachlan&#39;s despondent attitude, the boy&#39;s detachment to his surroundings and analytical glare directed towards Bill. He had an idea on why that may be, but asking about it would have been a mistake. We all loved keeping our secrets.

&quot;So ya don&#39;t have to worry &#39;bout it.&quot; Bill added. &quot;Cause my mom and sis are long gone.&quot; He laughed, wondering if the Goldsby line had any descendants. &quot;Does it feel good now?&quot;

He asked abruptly. &quot;Does it feel good that you don&#39;t have to watch your back. I&#39;m not gonna betray you. If I wanted to, I wouldn&#39;t be here.&quot; He was clearly referring to the incident back at the hotel. &quot;Probably hard for someone like you to believe though. Mind giving me an heads up for when ya plan on stabbing me in tha back?&quot; He giggled, much to Lachlan&#39;s displeasure.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122095017100587008 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122095017100587008><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, June 24, 2023 4:24 AM">4:24 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;How&#39;s that for a joke?&quot; Bill said, readjusting his seat as he put his foot back to the pedal. The traffic was unclogging and the heat was still unbearable, so might as well start making a move on instead of frying like an egg. 

&quot;Alright,&quot; Bill glanced at the map. &quot;straight to tha hotel. Unless ya got plans.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Me? Why would I backstab someone who&#39;s proven to be more useful than anything I&#39;ve created myself?&#39;

He lowered the car window, then swiftly snatched a copy of the morning news from a vendor who had been going around and plastering it on car windows in an attempt to sell them. He raised the window back up almost immediately, leaving the vendor bewildered for a moment. They started cursing and chasing after the car—but by that point, the traffic had already started moving.

Lachlan leaned back in his seat with a scowl, the vendor&#39;s slurs falling on (mostly) deaf ears. 

&#39;Do I have a say in this?&#39; He asked Bill. &#39;Roland&#39;s keeping watch over the workshop, I can&#39;t just stroll in there. So, the hotel it is. If I can&#39;t work on my Skinwalkers, we can at least organize all the intel we&#39;ve gathered so far. Time to put your Riding skill to the test, Bill,&#39; he unfolded the newspaper on his lap. &#39;Drive smoothly, I&#39;m trying to read.&#39;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Half an hour later...</code>
Lachlan glanced up from the last page of the newspaper and at the road ahead. 

&#39;I&#39;m pretty sure the hotel is within walking distance from my workshop,&#39; he commented calmly. &#39;And it&#39;s definitely nowhere near the Nile.&#39; 

The sun beamed down on the car, its rays heating it like an oven as they reflected off the surrounding waters. The car was being led down the bridge, surrounded by even heavier traffic. It turned out that trying to maneuver out of the morning rush was a terrible mistake; it felt as if they were trapped in a crowd, pushed in a direction they didn&#39;t want to go, only this time doubly trapped within a metal can.

The Servant would agree, of course, but it was hard to not see the Dowling&#39;s remark as something more. While Lachlan proceeded to rob a vendor for the daily news, Bill pondered on whether his Master was being honest or simply protecting himself in a web of lies.

He knew he would have done the same. Act tough and deride whenever people pried too much. But was the way he behaved the same way Lachlan did? Maybe he could use some rest too...

...But half an hour later, they were still stuck inside a hot, stuffy car. The traffic line had almost doubled in the time they had spent inside of it. He was confused, this sort of stuff never happened back in the West! Horse riders were a lot more efficient and responsible, while in here it felt like horses were smarter than the drivers themselves.

...Granted, not many could afford their own personal horse back in the day. It was hard to have traffic when it was limited to three to five carriages per road. Not like Bill cared, because he&#39;d find any reason to complain and rant about the good ol&#39;days™️

He took that chance the moment Lachlan started ribbing on him about the distance from the hotel. Well, to be more accurate, Lachlan was just talking, but the traffic, combined with Bill&#39;s irritated mind, did wonders for his reaction.

&quot;I can <em>fucking</em> see that.&quot; Bill replied, grumpily. &quot;How the hell do y&#39;all manage? This <em>sucks!&quot;</em> He snarled, angrily honking the car a bit more. &quot;At least the roads back home made sense. Nothing makes sense here! They just keep following me like flies to honey!&quot; He shouted, unaware that the drivers most likely had the same thoughts as him. Even Lachlan would be shocked by the huge lack of self-awareness.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122519197914779709 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122519197914779709><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 8:30 AM">8:30 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
But if there was one thing Bill had over a grumpy driver, it was his adaptability. Instead of accepting his fate of being struck in traffic for the next 3 days and nights, he grabbed a pen from the glove box and jotted down an X on the map. He then turned off the engine, opened the car door and left it ajar.

&quot;Get out. We&#39;re walking. I trust there&#39;s no issue?&quot; Bill asked, taking a whiff of air and observing his surroundings. They had parked on a busy street, just a few steps away from a bridge that overlooked the vast Nile river. It stretched for what seemed to be an eternity, far too distant for Bill to see the end of it, even with his precise vision.

Instead of focusing on that, however, Bill realized something far more important.

&quot;Wait, where the <em>hell</em> are we?&quot; He looked at the map, dumbfounded. It seemed like some aspects of it were outdated. Readable, but not fully accurate. &quot;Great Spirit, is there anything this backwater island is capable of doing <em>well?!&quot;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

No wonder cats loved to indulge themselves in the sun&#39;s rays and laze off whenever they could. Of course, not having to be the one behind the wheel added an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience too.

Screaming at other drivers? Not his concern. Keeping a vigilant eye on the road? Not his responbility. Dealing with road rage? Just turn up the music! Even better if he had a drink on hand!

When Bill kicked open the door and invited himself out, oozing a dark aura that seemed capable of setting the car ablaze, Lachlan folded his newspaper and stretched his limbs.

&#39;Well, I don&#39;t drive,&#39; he responded truthfully, honestly—which was, frankly, as irritating as one can get. &#39;I just assumed Roland manages it, somehow.&#39;

He glanced in the rearview mirror. Bill had parked the car, yes, but rather than the curbside, they had stopped right in the middle of the congested road. Even though the car ahead of them remained motionless, the drivers behind them, unaware of the circumstances, had already begun honking at the masked driver for leaving his car.

&#39;Well, this is new,&#39; Lachlan commented on Bill&#39;s innovative &#39;parking spot&#39;. &#39;You sure this is okay? What about parking tickets?&#39;

His nonchalance betrayed the lack of concern for the situation at hand, despite his question. Lachlan followed suit and exited the car. He was doing an even worse job than Bill, and didn&#39;t even bother to slam the door shut, further obstructing the adjacent lane.

He took a look around him. &#39;You&#39;re the one with the map,&#39; he said unhelpfully. &#39;Though my instincts tell me we should maybe head in <em>that</em> direction.&#39;

He left the car behind, more than happy to let the other drivers sort it out amongst themselves on what to do with the vehicle clogging the road. He then turned back to Bill and noticed the cowboy&#39;s complaints about directions and reacted accordingly.

&quot;Fine. Ya can have the map then.&quot; Bill harrumphed, shoving it in Lachlan&#39;s hands as he observed the area Lachlan was pointing at. Avoiding the bridges seemed fair, especially since it didn&#39;t take a genius to realize that bridges were meant to cross rivers, lakes and seas, not the distance from a workshop to an hotel.

&quot;The car&#39;ll be fine. Let&#39;s move.&quot; He snapped his fingers, walking on the side path as he expected Lachlan to follow suit. Soon, the cacophony of honks and angry drivers started to vanish, instead replaced by much quieter sounds of birds chirping and the wind blowing. Quiet, unassuming areas like these were the best places to stay undercover and avoid attention. If you stuck out like a sore thumb though, like Mr. Cowboy over here and his British suitor that looked the part, then you might attract unneeded attention.

<em>&quot;Taxi?&quot;</em> Case in point, a random man approached the two and gesticulated with his arms, repeating one singular word. Taxi, taxi, taxi. Soon, other men followed suit, repeating the same word and holding crude, cardboard signs with fares written on them.

&quot;No, no, no-&quot; Bill shook his head, waving his arms through the sea of taxi drivers looking to make a quick buck out of Lachlan. His patience was running dry, but just like Roland had said, his goal was to get Lachlan to nap in peace. Suddenly culling the entire taxi driver population of Berenice would go against that objective.

Though, he had to admit, it was getting a lot harder to move around the city with a horde of starving taxi drivers blocking their path... <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He pocketed the map, but didn&#39;t make any genuine effort to decipher it. After all, if Bill, who had been granted inherent knowledge of modern maps and had been driving all this time, couldn&#39;t even make sense of it, then what hope did Lachlan have with his own eyes?

Without another word, the puppeteer fell into step beside the cowboy. He paid little attention to where they were headed, and simply followed whichever path Bill led them down while his mind wandered back to the multiple surgeries awaiting his puppets. It wasn&#39;t as if they&#39;d actually lost their way; in the worst-case scenario, they could always hail a...

<em>&#39;Taxi?&#39;</em>

Lachlan bumped into Bill&#39;s back. Rubbing his sore nose, he peered out from behind Archer, finally noticing with a twitching eye that they had unwittingly landed themselves in a circle of taxi drivers, all of whom inquiring them in broken English.

Bill vigorously shook his head and gestured wildly, but it had minimal effect. The drivers clung to them like bees to honey, as if their rich people radar had been triggered. The prices they were quoting for the rides were outrageous; one look and anyone could see that they were trying to rip these poor tourists off! There was no way a trip back to the hotel would cost 3 digits in cash...
 
Bill, of course, was having none of it. Unfortunately, he found himself saddled with the most unhelpful sidekick imaginable...

&#39;You,&#39; Lachlan spoke suddenly, pompously, pointing to a random driver as if bestowing upon them a royal decree. &#39;You shall be our chauffeur.&#39;

Alas, forgive him, but Lachlan was accustomed to being spoiled. Placing a hand on Bill&#39;s arm, he motioned for the Archer to quiet down. Then, with a practiced smile that he had honed to near perfection, he motioned for the appointed driver to approach.

He held up three fingers, indicating his fare. Meanwhile, the other drivers began shouting numbers in broken English, each one lowering their prices in an attempt to outbid one another.

&#39;This right here is the law of the jungle. Watch and learn,&#39; Lachlan said smugly to Bill. He set his eyes on a new driver who had reduced their fare to a mere 50 Egyptian pounds, then reached into his pocket...

...

......

&#39;Let&#39;s leave.&#39;

Lachlan said, as pleasantly as ever, but now he was dragging Bill away in haste. The taxi drivers followed them along, bewildered by the sudden change in the redhead&#39;s demeanor. Some of them even attempted to cut him off, as their tones grew more aggressive.

The forged smile on the puppeteer&#39;s face vanished, replaced by a thin line.

<em>&lt;You know what, on second thought, why don&#39;t you shoot <strong>them</strong> all down?&gt;</em>

Judging by the veins bulging on his forehead, Lachlan was just about nearing the breaking point of his mysterious temper...

To his surprise, Lachlan seemed to be enjoying this, suddenly picking out a random driver and dragging Bill along for the ride. What was his Master planning? Could he not sniff out the obvious scam?

What came next surprised him, although he should have expected it in hindsight. Lachlan put up an angelic little smile, only to quickly pick out another one from the crowd who had offered a cheaper fee. The boy then reached down for his pocket, rustled around and then-

His smile disappeared. He dragged Bill by the wrist and immediately had him follow his Master&#39;s trail. The horde of taxi drivers was still following them like rabid dogs, but Bill was still confused by his Master&#39;s attitude. They had gone from having complete control over the situation to looking like someone who woke up on the wrong side of the bed. The fact that they were toying with the idea of murdering the horde of drivers was also a bad sign. What ever happened to being covert?!

<em>&lt;The fuck? Ya know I can&#39;t do that. As much as I&#39;d want to.&gt;</em> Bill chided, noticing the bulge on Lachlan&#39;s forehead. Guess they weren&#39;t so different after all, especially when it came to reacting to crowds of idiots. <em>&lt;Why did ya bother to call them out in the first place? Now they think you actually want to pay them! The hell were you thinkin&#39;?&gt;</em>

It probably wasn&#39;t wise of Bill to criticize Lachlan&#39;s judgment, especially with how furious the man already was. As they talked, the drivers started to speed up, blocking the two&#39;s path while some even got into their cars and started blocking the roads with reckless parking.

<em>&lt;Great. They don&#39;t take no for an answer.&gt;</em> Bill sighed, cracking his neck as he got ready to shoo them off the old fashioned way. <em>&lt;See? I got no clue why ya did that, boss.

Oh. It finally hit. How could Bill be so foolish? He had already experienced this before, back when he had left Lachlan and was left to his own devices. He had used up his funds in an instant, to the point he was easily ensnared by Assassin&#39;s charms due to the almighty power of the dollar bill. There could only be one reason for Lachlan&#39;s attitude right now.

He just kept walking in one direction until he couldn&#39;t anymore (get lost, scalpers!), then changed course and started down another driver-less street. It was a poorly thought-out tactic; the persistent drivers seemed to multiply like the Coroner&#39;s Zombie horde, blocking every possible escape route with their presence. It became painfully clear that they couldn&#39;t afford to linger on the streets any longer.

So, with Bill&#39;s stern refusal to entertain his suggestion of a massacre in broad daylight, Lachlan resorted to the next best thing...

He began to test the doors of the buildings along the street, pushing against them in search of one that was unlocked. At the first door that budged, he ducked right inside with Bill in tow.

<em>SLAM!</em>

Lachlan leaned his weight against the door, until the noise outside gradually faded away. Only then did he deign to look at Bill.

Just a quick glance though. Then he went back to staring at the floor, making it a point to count every speck of dust rather than meeting Bill in the eye. He pulled up his shirt collar, before folding his arms across his chest in a rather defensive posture.

&#39;...&#39;

He muttered something under his breath, but Bill couldn&#39;t make out the words. However, one thing was apparent—despite the puppeteer&#39;s apparent annoyance, the tips of his ears had turned a light shade of pink.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122590494640320633 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122590494640320633><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 1:13 PM">1:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He kept going until he came across a glass door, pushing it open as he dragged Bill inside and slammed down with his entire weight. He could see the drivers behind the glass, faces pressed on the door as they kept waving signs around and asking for payments. 

But Lachlan ignored them, and he ignored Bill as well. He stared at the floor, crossing his arms and whispering something under his breath. Archer didn&#39;t know why his boss was acting like such a child, but the flashes of pink on the man&#39;s ears were filling the blanks for him.

&quot;Ya can&#39;t be serious.&quot; Bill narrowed his eyes, on the verge of laughing. &quot;Roland didn&#39;t give ya any pocket money?&quot; He spurted, letting out a small giggle, which was sure to infuriate Lachlan further. Almost as if to make up for it, Bill leaned his body on the door, keeping it blocked and preventing the drivers from even budging it.

Eventually, the swarm of taxi drivers lost interest and left. The two could finally be at ease, albeit they both wondered how come a building had left their door open. Turns out, they had just entered a store. Some sort of pastry shop with Arabic looking sweets. A sign on the top was written in white and pink, spelling out <em>The Donut Daddy.</em>

Whether there was a nugget of truth in his statement was irrelevant at this point, as they were too far away from the car to check. Or his wallet could have been forgotten anywhere between the hotel and the workshop, but their current location also made it impossible to check.

And don&#39;t even <em>think</em> to phone Roland, the puppeteer&#39;s tone seemed to suggest.

What mattered most was that Lachlan was now penniless, while trapped in the bustling tourist hub of Berenice. Without a coin to his person, he was essentially powerless and reduced to the status of a mere peasant.

Irritated and deeply embarrassed, the puppeteer looked away; it turned to be a terrible mistake, however, as his eyes were immediately assaulted by a colorful array of merchandise. It was the worst kind of temptation too: they had landed inside a pastry shop, with a variety of delectable, sugary treats on display. As the door to the back kitchen swung open, a delightful aroma wafted into the store.

Against his brain&#39;s better judgement, Lachlan&#39;s stomach churned in response. He had only subsisted on a few mouthfuls of sugary fluids since the early morning, and now, under the bright sunlight and after a considerable amount of walking (and even jogging!), the allure of sweets proved to be quite irresistible.

&#39;Well, do <em>you</em> have your wallet?&#39; He asked Bill in the most nonchalant tone he could muster. &#39;Roland gives <em>you</em> pocket money. Technically, it&#39;s mine to spend, since I&#39;m the one who hands him the pay slip.&#39;</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 5:00 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122637101314355290 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122637101314355290><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 4:19 PM">4:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not the words, but the malignant glare. Bill chose to not prod about it further, mostly out of solidarity. He too would react the same way if he had just forgotten his wallet or had it stolen.

&quot;Shucks. Guess we should head back and grab it then.&quot; He offered, about to turn around, before seeing his Master look expectantly at the sweets put on display. Indeed, the aroma was nice, delicious even. He did go on a French pastry binge with Assassin just a few days ago. A bit too sweet and &#39;childish&#39; for his tastes, but food was food, and his Master looked ready to eat an entire horse.

It was obvious too, since upon realizing his hunger, Lachlan immediately looked for another piggy bank. He stared at Bill with a blank face, like a cat expecting the owner to deliver something. In this case, it was money.

&quot;Uh, well,&quot; Bill stammered. His date with Assassin had reminded him of yet another crucial detail: About how he had spent all of his money on food already, leaving him with nothing but cobwebs. And with the chaos that had ensued in the past few days, he hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to ask Roland for cash yet. Not like he expected the Dowling secretary to even give him any after what happened last time.

<strong>&quot;I gave it back.&quot;</strong> Bill immediately covered his ass by throwing Roland under the bus. &quot;He told me he needed it, so I just handed it over. Not like I needed it.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders, his mask doing wonders to hide his face.

&quot;But I can tell that yer hungry. Why dontcha just use your hypnosis kerfuffle again? An easy snatch and steal.&quot; Archer pointed out. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It made a hell lot of sense. A no-brainer too, given how susceptible the common folks were to Hypnosis. It wasn&#39;t a question of whether he <em>could</em> do it or <em>not</em>, but rather <em>when</em> he would give in to temptation.

And yet, Lachlan couldn&#39;t bring himself to do it. This wasn&#39;t the same as getting payback from the vulture-like vendors on the streets; the mere thought of using his powers to swindle pastries from a pastry shop in a backwaters town caused his face to flush. He, Lachlan James Dowling, the heir to the infamous Dowling estate, resorting to tricks for a donut?

&#39;Seriously? <em>Now</em> you play nice?&#39; He asked incredulously. &#39;Since when do you ever let go of your precious booze money?&#39;

No, he couldn&#39;t stoop so low. Not in a million years! Lachlan averted his gaze, refusing to even glance at the mouthwatering cupcakes with their velvety swirls of frosting, or the crescent-shaped croissants begging to be savored with their delicate crunch, or the plump, glazed donuts shimmering under the pink and white lights, OR the gooey caramel drizzled over the golden apple tarts...

God damn it, he was still staring. His eyes were still scrutinizing each pasty like they were some specimen under a microscopic lens. He wasn&#39;t even performing a surgical procedure...he should just turn around and walk out while his dignity was still intact! 

<em>&lt;We&#39;re going.&gt;</em>

Lachlan projected his thoughts to Bill, along with several mental images of the tantalizing pastries his sharp eyes had picked up. An unintentional slip, but one that he would take to his grave rather than admit outright. With tremendous effort (and regret), the puppeteer finally made up his mind to leave...</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 5:57 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A booming voice echoed through the pastry store as a burly man emerged from the back. His bulging, veiny arms and imposing presence made it clear that he was not one to be trifled with. The man narrowed his eyes and looked from Lachlan to Bill. His gaze lingered on Bill&#39;s mask a second longer than the redhead, as if donning a mask was akin to being a thief.

&#39;You two look like fine gents,&#39; he finally said after a thorough assessment that made both Lachlan and Archer feel as if they&#39;d just been x-rayed. He almost seemed perplexed, as they both dressed quite nicely. 

&#39;What seems to be the matter?&#39; He asked again, his tone soothing but edging on suspicion...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122660261560602654 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122660261560602654><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 5:51 PM">5:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I don&#39;t look like a saint to you?&quot; Bill asked facetiously. He knew what Lachlan was implying, but he wouldn&#39;t budge from his statement. He would lie with his teeth. His Master didn&#39;t see through it, perhaps because they were preoccupied with their own struggles, such as how pathetic it would look for a Dowling to resort to magic for a cheap steal. This wasn&#39;t a prestigious robbery; it was the act of simply grabbing a donut and running away with it. Plebian at its finest.

Because of that, Lachlan took one last look at the pastries before turning around and heading for the exit. He send Bill a mental message, albeit it came out muffled with images of delicious pastries being interspersed throughout. 

&quot;Goddamn, yer hungry. I&#39;m gonna feel the same at this rate.&quot; Bill joked, about to leave as well, before the two were interrupted by a sudden cry. An absolute unit of a man emerged, veins visible on their biceps and triceps as they stared at Bill intently, seeing them as a potential threat to their business. Well, someone with glowing eyes, a full black outfit and a mask would have anyone ringing alarm bells, really.

Just like Bill had suspected, the man accused them (specifically him) of being thieves, only to then retract their statement and call them fine gentlemen. Then, as if sensing the unease in the air, he started prodding them a bit. It was hard to <em>not</em> look suspicious, especially with Bill&#39;s odd outfit and Lachlan&#39;s hungry eyes.

To Bill, however, this presented quite the opportunity.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1122678760806830172 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1122678760806830172><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, June 25, 2023 7:04 PM">7:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Wuzzamatter with you, chief?!&quot; Bill shouted, wailing his arms and raising his voice as if he were trying to instigate a fight. &quot;Me and my buddy here just came for a donut, and we immediately get treated as thieves? No wonder we feel at unease!&quot; He slapped Lachlan on the back and lurched him forward, trying to get the store owner(?) to look at the boy in the eyes. Despite Lachlan&#39;s nonchalant expression, it was obvious that those eyes belonged to a hungry puppy.

&quot;But screw this.&quot; Bill immediately pulled him back. &quot;We&#39;re not having donuts at some place that doesn&#39;t even respect us. Especially if we&#39;re typecast as thieves!&quot; Lachlan would be surprised by Bill&#39;s new vocabulary, almost as if he had been hanging out with more sophisticated types while he wasn&#39;t around. Or maybe he was always that smart?

Nah. Not a chance.

He stumbled forward until his was sprawled against the counter, leaving him an uncomfortably intimate distance away from the array of delectable pastries.

But that wasn&#39;t all. Mere inches away, the shop owner&#39;s expression was changing faster than the weather across the Great Plains as Bill dragged his Master deeper into the charade. There was no turning back now; he had to commit to the act or risk losing face by walking out.

<em>&lt;Ugh...&gt;</em> 

A jumble of incoherent thoughts flooded Bill&#39;s mind. But instead of fully constructed arguments, all Archer could sense was cringe. And sprinkles of embarrassment. 

What was this, theater camp?

&#39;...This is just plain terrible.&#39; Lachlan groaned. &#39;I never expected to be judged for craving a donut from the famous&#39;—his eyes wandered to the cutesy store sign—&#39;Donut Daddy. Oh, I&#39;m so sad. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have the desire to eat a donut again.&#39;

The words tumbled out of his mouth mechanically, accompanied by a slightly twitching gaze and a downturned mouth. Lachlan hoped that his cringing expression could pass for longing, so long as they took his unintentional snarling for sadness. 

Thankfully, Bill intervened quickly, pulling him back from the counter. Lachlan wanted to swat his hand away, but under the scrutinizing gaze of the shop owner, awkwardly transitioned into grabbing his hand instead. 

&#39;Let&#39;s get out of here,&#39; he tugged at Archer&#39;s arm. &#39;Seems like even the so-called donut daddy is nothing more than a bully.&#39;

He wanted to dig a hole in the ground and bury himself.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The accusation had caught him thoroughly off guard; he had never seen such bold-faced liars in his shop before, and something about their exaggerated claims of innocent made him question his initial judgement. 

Perhaps...he really had misunderstood them?

&#39;Look, fellas,&#39; he said, rather defensively. &#39;I didn&#39;t mean to jump to conclusions. There have been some rumors going around town, you know? I was just being cautious. My donuts have quite the reputation in these parts, after all.&#39;

Looking from Bill&#39;s indignant posture to Lachlan&#39;s saddened(?) face, the shop owner heaved a sigh. &#39;Tell you what,&#39; he shook his head. &#39;Since it&#39;s been a slow morning, how about I give you some free samples?

-Lachlan did exactly what Bill demanded, much to his surprise. He started &quot;&quot;&quot;acting&quot;&quot;&quot;, putting up the most monotone expression and bored tone that could ever be conceived. Not an ounce of cuteness or sincerity came from the boy&#39;s mouth, to the point his actions resembled that of a walking corpse. So dry was his acting that the air itself had gone cold.

And yet it worked, the donut daddy taking the bait and refusing to let a potential customer leave with a 1 star review. Bill smiled, swelling with pride and getting a big head as he realized that his plan had worked.

<em>&lt;See? Told ya!&gt;</em> A thought zapped into Lachlan&#39;s mind, like an annoying fly begging to be swatted. The cowboy viewed his plan as a success, especially when the store owner was preventing them from leaving and instead offering up a compromise. Free testing samples were probably all that Lachlan needed to recover his strength and satisfy his hunger.

&quot;Ya think free samples will buy us back?!&quot; Bill added loudly, acting with a bit more soul behind him. &quot;We&#39;re not fickle. We can tell when someone is just being nice out of necessity. Bet ya plan on handing us moldy breadsticks or something out of the &quot;&quot;&quot;kindness&quot;&quot;&quot; of your heart.&quot; The cowboy accentuated rather well, clearly implying that the donut daddy was just trying to cover their own ass. Bill tapped on Lachlan&#39;s foot as he spoke, as if to say <em>&#39;This is how ya act!&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1123328037186977902 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1123328037186977902><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, June 27, 2023 2:04 PM">2:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;Those goods of yours in the back-&quot; Bill pointed to the unsold goods that the donut daddy stored behind the counter. &quot;-tasting those will suffice! Right?&quot; He turned to Lachlan for his approval. Though, as he spoke, he couldn&#39;t help but overhear the store owner&#39;s words. He  could understand the man being wary of thieves and he could even understand the free sample offer since bad word of mouth could ruin a business, but-

&quot;What rumors?&quot; Bill looked confused. &quot;People think yer a bit too thick to be making sweets or something?&quot; The cowboy rubbed his own arms as he said that, clearly referring to the daddy&#39;s muscular arms with protruding veins erupting from them.

Weakness of the dough will not be tolerated by my kneading hands!&#39; He proclaimed loudly.

But of course, Bill wasn&#39;t one to relent, instead casting even more slander his way. The sheer audacity of him! The owner was shocked. His eyes grew wide as he stormed up to the cowboy and thrust his arm right in his face.

&#39;Feast your eyes upon these beauties!&#39; He flexed his arms, inviting the Archer pair to marvel at their rippling, veiny length, from the bulging biceps down to the muscular wrist. &#39;These arms will have ovens flushing, spatulas swooning, and rolling pins begging for mercy. They&#39;re strong enough to knead mountains of dough but gentle enough to sculpt sugar-spun roses with ease. Just look!&#39;

He pointed with swelling pride at the top of the glass shelf, where several said sugar roses were packaged like real flowers. The owner breathed deeply through his nose, tilting his head back at the slightest slant so he could gaze down at his uncouth customers.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

But, despite his scathing remarks, the puppeteer couldn&#39;t resist following Bill and the owner to the shelf. At the end of the day, a man&#39;s still gotta eat. His stomach couldn&#39;t subsist on empty threats alone.

Bill continued to make a show of his apparent success, boasting in not only his, but also the shop owner&#39;s face, much to the latter&#39;s chagrin. It suited Lachlan just fine, as it gave him ample time to peruse the assortment of baked goods on the shelf.

With a discerning eye™️, he selected a few pastries that caught his fancy, then promptly bit into one—a glazed donut. A burst of sweetness greeted his famished taste buds. He didn&#39;t take the least care in savoring the bite, before swallowing it and taking another, then another...

The donut quickly disappeared. Lachlan started on a cookie, munching on it like a chipmunk as he watched the two muscle-for-brains engage in a contest of...well, it most definitely wouldn&#39;t be called &#39;wits&#39;.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1125882063480954971 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1125882063480954971><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 4, 2023 3:13 PM">3:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill could tell the moment he was forced to stare at the man&#39;s pile of arm meat, rippling and bursting at the seams like a dormant volcano. He stared at it with a tinge of disgust. See, this is why he never worked out. Getting too big kinda grossed him out, especially since it would have just made him an even bigger. No amount of muscle could protect you from a .50 caliber bullet, so why even bother?

&quot;I believe ya. I wouldn&#39;t want to be at the end of those.&quot; Bill nodded, rolling his eyes as the store owner started bragging about their sugar rose collection next. This made Bill wonder if he could eat them, but decided that toeing the line too much could cause trouble. Especially since his Master was currently feasting, so weakened that he was devouring the donuts with abandon, unaware of the stray traces of butter and custard that now made his monotone expression look humorous instead.

Bill also grabbed a donut, but as much as he loved food, it was quite different to eat as a Servant compared to the feeling you had when hungry. Anytime Bill had that instinct, it was simply his core warning him about low mana reserves. The store owner wondered how the Archer could even eat the donut, since their mask seemed to have zero openings, but one moment it was there and the next it was gone.

The pastry was delicious. Its filling was luxurious. Yet Bill felt a lot more jealous about Lachlan&#39;s own reaction to the food. So jealous, indeed, that he started peeking into the boy&#39;s mind, trying to see what the almighty Lachlan thought about the food-

Instead, he got another scathing remark, this time directed towards the two meatheads in the room. The cowboy grumbled, his hand itching for a slap while the donut daddy kept flexing his sculpted pecs at him.

But then Bill realized that he could break two pebbles with one dove. Silence this patisserie who couldn&#39;t stop talking about their training regimen while also giving Lachlan his just desserts. The cowboy took a step to compose himself before he spoke out again.

&quot;Friendo, this is the fourth time yer ranting about yer cardio regimen. I don&#39;t give a <em>damn</em> &#39;bout what da hell ya do! Ya still look tiny.&quot; Bill spat out, insulting the man&#39;s height. &quot;In fact, my much, <em>much</em> shorter friend over here could probably do anything you can. He could lift yer arm with a pinky.&quot; The cowboy boasted.

&quot;Why not prove it, even? How &#39;bout a friendly lil&#39; arm wrestling competition? Best o&#39; three. If we win we get another box of those,&quot; Bill pointed to donuts in the kitchen. &quot;if we lose, uh, we won&#39;t.&quot; He said bluntly. &quot;But yer free to dream, if you&#39;d like!&quot;

Archer&#39;s laughter echoed across the store, turning Lachlan&#39;s flavorful pastries into something much more unpleasant. Thoughts started criss-crossing in his mind. <em>&lt;There boss. I&#39;ve set the stage for you. Go on. You know you want to.&gt;</em> Bill attempted to gently persuade his Master. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Him, <em>tiny</em>? He could crush almonds into fine crumbs with his fingers alone! The kid, on the other hand, looked more spindly than a rolling pin.

&#39;What game are you playing at? I can snap the kid&#39;s spine with <em>my</em> pinky!&#39; He said with an equal mix of suspicion and curiosity. He rubbed his chin and scrutinized Bill like a bowl of freshly proofed dough, while the latter nonchalantly snatched a donut and made it disappear under his mask. 

But Bill didn&#39;t back off. Instead he kept driving up the stakes—at no expense of his own, of course—now using the shop&#39;s own donuts as a wager. 

The owner&#39;s eyes narrowed; his pride couldn&#39;t resist the taunt.

<strong>&#39;Fine!&#39;</strong> He swept his arms toward the Archer pair magnanimously. &#39;Be my guest, take a box of donuts if you win. But should you lose,&#39; he wagged a finger at them, &#39;which you undoubtedly will, then you&#39;ll have to cough up some cash for all the pastries you&#39;ve eaten so far. Otherwise...&#39; 

He jerked a thumb towards the back kitchen. &#39;Otherwise, I will put you both to work in my shop for the next two days. It&#39;s the end of the year, and orders are pouring in. I&#39;m running myself haggard with these batch orders alone. Got no time for my beauty regimen, even.&#39;

&#39;Now, best of three, you say?&#39; The shop owner&#39;s gaze shifted to Lachlan, now sizing him up with a smirk on his lips. &#39;Are you absolutely sure you don&#39;t want to step up and compete yourself? It would be quite a waste if I were to snap his twig-like arm in the very first round.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

There he was, minding his own business and gorging himself on some delicious treats while drama unfolded before his eyes. Little did he know, however, that he was about to be dragged into the midst of this circus act himself.

Lachlan blinked. Cheeks full of pastries, he resorted to the only form of communication available to him in that moment: telepathy.

<em>&lt;You know, if you&#39;re so determined to get me, there are far more straightforward ways to go about it. Take me to a secluded alley and break my arms yourself, you coward. I&#39;ve spotted quite a few suitable alleys during my &#39;trip&#39; the other day; I&#39;m sure you can find one to your liking if you&#39;ll allow me to show you around. No need to be so shy about it, hmm?&gt;</em>

He spoke casually, but the words felt like a jab to Bill&#39;s mind. Sarcasm aside, it seemed that Lachlan wasn&#39;t so keen on the idea of this ludicrous match. And who could blame him? Engaging himself in such uncouth behavior was beneath him. He hadn&#39;t traveled to Egypt to wrestle a pastry chef, as there were much more important matters to—

&lt;After all, it wouldn&#39;t be fair of me to bully a commoner who doesn&#39;t even know the first thing about magecraft.&gt;

A sense of smugness flowed into Bill&#39;s mental link. Despite his Master&#39;s harsh words, he was actually feeling rather stoked about this upcoming match, albeit in a roundabout manner. What a difficult person...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126274511407415327 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126274511407415327><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 5:12 PM">5:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Big if.&quot; Bill crossed his arms and puckered his lips, the custard chef&#39;s warnings hitting like a spring breeze at most. He was fully confident that there was no way he could lose to such a dull man. He&#39;d even eat his hat if he was wrong. Mister Donut Daddy couldn&#39;t tell where Bill&#39;s confidence was coming from: All it took was one glance at Lachlan to realize that the kid was completely outmatched. The store owner&#39;s muscly arms could probably drag <em>both</em> of the Dowling&#39;s arms down, let alone just one!

Perhaps out of pity, they offered Bill the chance to compete instead. The cowboy just shook his head, then cast a glance at his partner in crime.

<em>&lt;And miss out on the donuts? At least I can stuff myself here.&gt;</em> Bill joked, replying to Lachlan&#39;s accusations with casual deflections. To the Dowling&#39;s credit, this did seem like one of Archer&#39;s typical ways to get back at someone. If he couldn&#39;t do so physically, what better way to get someone else to do the dirty work for him?

But Bill seemed to have further intentions, sniffing out airs of competition and pride from Lachlan&#39;s demeanor. More than usual, at least.

<em>&lt;...Wait, so yer tellin&#39; me ya can&#39;t beat this guy <strong>without</strong> Magecraft?&gt;</em> Bill asked all of a sudden, with a tone that felt both mocking and curious. <em>&lt;Kid, have ya ever arm wrestled before? I did that back in the day. Ya know, before I was a Servant. Good bar game! Haven&#39;t lost a single one of them since I became an outlaw.&gt;</em> 

Archer giggled, leaning on a wall as he shook one last <em>&#39;no&#39;</em> at the donut master, confirming that Lachlan would be their opponent. If his Master could even be bothered, that is.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126279455866888302 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126279455866888302><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 5:32 PM">5:32 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;...I mean, I guess yer right. We don&#39;t <strong>have to</strong> beat this guy into submission with a good old game of arm wrestling.&gt;</em> Bill said with a shrug, but his tone didn&#39;t quite sound right to Lachlan. It sounded like...

Teasing.

<em>&lt;I guess I expected a bit more out of, y&#39;know, my Master. But someone born higher up prolly never got tha chance to play these...what&#39;s it called? <strong>Plebian?</strong> Yeah. That.&gt;</em> Bill snorted, eyeing the store exit. <em>&lt;Sorry for putting ya on tha spot, kid. Should we just leave, then?&gt;</em> He asked with a cheeky grin. Talk about malicious compliance to a fault. Archer was fully aware that Lachlan would rather do anything else than compete in a brutish game between two lunkheads, so what better way to rile him up than to attack at his pride?</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 5:33 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1126279894951792690 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1126279894951792690><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 5, 2023 5:34 PM">5:34 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Lachlan&#39;s words rang with a touch of resignation. It was a frank assessment, without any false bravado. It was hardly a question either, with zero room for doubt. One glance at the puppeteer and anyone could tell that he was at the exact opposite end of the physical prowess spectrum. The ordeals of the past week had left him especially worn; he now looked like a reed that swayed in even the slightest breeze.

<em>&lt;I&#39;ve dedicated all my time to the study of Magecraft. It only makes sense for me to use the fruits of my labor, don&#39;t you think? Would <strong>you</strong> walk into a fight without your trusty guns?&gt;</em> He asked pointedly. <em>&lt;Unless, of course, you&#39;re seeking to make a fool of yourself.&gt;</em>

He brushed the crumbs off his hands, before tucking them into his coat pockets. <em>&lt;Sorry to burst your bubble, Bill,&gt;</em> he continued wryly, <em>&lt;but there&#39;s nothing I can do without Magecraft, as you&#39;ve seen firsthand. I&#39;m utterly useless without it, just as you can&#39;t purchase anything without a wallet. So go on, laugh if you must. Isn&#39;t that what you wanted?&gt;</em>

Bill&#39;s body language told him everything he needed to know. The cowboy wasn&#39;t pressed for time. The subtle glances toward the exit, the cheery shift in his tone...Oh, trouble was definitely on his mind, and not even the sweet aromas of the patisseries could mask the stench of his intentions.

Had this been a week ago, Lachlan would have dealt him a hard slap on the wrist immediately, accompanied by the activation of a Command Spell to impose some form of punishment onto him. But now that Bill understood the value Lachlan placed on his remaining Command Spells, perhaps he felt emboldened, knowing that his Master wouldn&#39;t waste them so easily.

And now, the only viable option for the puppeteer to take was to storm out in humiliation, which would undoubtedly be a win in Bill&#39;s book—

<em>&lt;Well, if I <strong>must</strong>.&gt;</em>

Without so much as a glance at the exit, Lachlan strode forward until he stood face to face with the shop owner, catching Bill off guard. &#39;You heard the man,&#39; he tilted his chin at the muscular man. &#39;I&#39;m your opponent. Try to beat me first before you even consider challenging him. <em>If</em> you can beat me, that is.&#39;

He extended his left hand, offering it for a handshake. At the same time, he spoke to Bill through their telepathic link.

&lt;Not that my non-dominant hand will be of much use later on anyway, even if gets injured,&gt; he said in an almost self-deprecating manner. &lt;You wanted a spectacle?

Bill expected a lot, considering how Lachlan had behaved towards him and many others in the past. He was fully ready for his Master to throw a small tantrum at his teasing. Instead, he was denied that, being offered a look of complete defeat in Lachlan&#39;s eyes. The boy hadn&#39;t even accepted the challenge yet, let alone participated in it!

In terms of physical prowess, Lachlan knew that he was far behind the donut daddy. He made no attempt to hide it, instead calling Bill out for proposing such a ridiculously unfair idea. What next? Should Lachlan make a joke about how he might as well fight Masters without his Servant? Oh wait...

<em>&lt;Eh? The fuck are ya doin&#39;?&gt;</em> Bill asked, somewhat shocked. He wanted to annoy the boy, but this wasn&#39;t even annoyance. This was downright resignation, with Lachlan abandoning himself to his fate and offering his arm up to the donut daddy. This wasn&#39;t a challenge: He was placing his arm to be cut. An amputation.

<em>&lt;Oh, Great Spirit,&gt;</em> Bill ranted in his head, which unfortunately meant that Lachlan could hear him too. <em>&lt;why are kids so god damn stupid, man?!&gt;</em> So rich, coming from him.

<em>&lt;Whaddaya think I did without my guns back in the day? Just keeled over and died?&gt;</em> Lachlan wished he could say <em>&#39;yes, exactly that&#39;</em>, but he wasn&#39;t enough of a history buff to find proof of that happening. <em>&lt;I was a nobody. People didn&#39;t even look at me. I had to climb my way up with my own two hands. Look at me now.&gt;</em> He took another opportunity to boast, but then pointed towards the store owner in secret.

<em>&lt;Look at him too. Do ya think he was born with all that muscle? No! This moron worked his ass off to earn all that meat. It&#39;s all &#39;bout that give and take.&gt;</em> Bill lectured, which simply tired his Master more than anything else.

<em>&lt;But if ya take long enough, ya start thinking it&#39;s inevitable.&gt;</em> He could sense Archer smiling underneath his mask. <em>&lt;Donut daddy already thinks yer an easy mark. Just a little twerp getting way over his head. How does it feel to be looked down on, huh?&gt;</em>

<strong>&lt;Doesn&#39;t it make ya wanna go apeshit?&gt;</strong> Bill grinned. <em>&lt;Teach that guy a lesson for looking down on you?&gt;</em> It was just formless thoughts, but the tone went from a whisper to a boiling kettle ringing in Lachlan&#39;s ear.

<em>&lt;One in six bullets can miss, but ya still have five left. Stop acting like ya have none. Or, are ya tellin&#39; me I shouldn&#39;t even have to take you seriously as a Master?&gt;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Have you never observed me at work? I am a puppet master, not a boxer. I&#39;d be lucky to come out of this with just one broken arm.&gt;</em>

He joked lightly, but his tone was anything but. Lachlan couldn&#39;t comprehend Bill&#39;s intentions. He had made efforts to understand, but the pieces simply didn&#39;t fit. Why would Bill set him up for an impossible task, then grow frustrated when he acknowledged the impossibility? Wasn&#39;t that what the cowboy had wanted to see?

<em>&lt;I&#39;m not here for your amusement,&gt;</em> he stated plainly. <em>&lt;I have my own ways of teaching people a lesson. If you can&#39;t respect my methods, then that isn&#39;t on me. But having said that, right now, what I want to do the most is to wipe that dopey smile off both your faces.&gt;</em>

<em>&lt;Because you are running my patience to the ground,&gt;</em> he continued, while rolling up his left sleeve. <em>&lt;Who said that I wouldn&#39;t exact my sweet revenge if this bloke actually managed to break my arm? I&#39;ve never left a debt unpaid. Not in the past, and certainly not now. If you still call yourself my Servant, then don&#39;t behave like that one stray bullet that misses its mark.&gt;</em>

Well, that was <em>one</em> way, if not Bill&#39;s way, to deal with condescending assholes. A lesson was still a lesson at the end of the day, no matter when it was delivered.

At least the game was straightforward enough. Lachlan flexed his fingers a few times. He proceeded to raise an eyebrow at the Donut Daddy, provoking him further. &#39;Don&#39;t chicken out on me now,&#39; he said, then rested his arm on the counter near the cash register.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1127353083077349559 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1127353083077349559><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 8, 2023 4:38 PM">4:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Just a sentence really. Nothing too harmful. Not as painful as a knife or a whole lotta lead. That&#39;s what Bill tried to convince himself, but despite his best efforts, they struck a chord.

Toyed and played around with at saloons, because of his skin and distant mother. If he didn&#39;t obey, he&#39;d get beat up, so he just lowered his head and accepted it. It was his fate to be a little monkey, sticking out his tongue as people dropped waxy hot candles on the tip, acting as if they were bananas.

Was he treating Lachlan like a monkey? Of course not! He was still his Master, and even though he didn&#39;t show it, he did <em>somewhat</em> care about him! He was a meal ticket. An ally. The only other person he could entrust the Grail with.

Then why did it feel good to enjoy the brat&#39;s misery? Why was it oh so satisfying to talk down to this kid that acted like they owned it all? Lachlan wasn&#39;t an idiot: He had figured out Bill ten whole minutes ago, even before Bill had figured himself out. He knew for a fact that deep down, Archer always wanted to see the brat get humbled. To receive his just desserts.

After all, since when <em>hadn&#39;t</em> people wanted to see Lachlan get taken down a notch? Success breeds contempt. Everybody in the world was an enemy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128065805695848520 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128065805695848520><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 3:50 PM">3:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Bill had just proven this with his ridiculous proposal. And he had only just now realized how his actions looked. Not easy to think from the perspective of someone different than you, was it?

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-ansi">[2;31m[1;31m&#39;BUT YOU CAN&#39;T! BECAUSE THE WORLD ONLY REVOLVES AROUND YOU AND YOUR INSUFFERABLE EGO!&#39;[0m[2;31m[0m</code>

Archer bit his tongue. He could see the other twerp mucking about in the donut store, breaking bottles just like the last time they went into a drunken tirade. It was nothing more than a vision, of course, but a frustrating memory regardless. Bill kept staring at donuts for a sense of peace, yet his eyes kept focusing on the glass reflections instead. He could see himself.

He could see how big and tall and imposing he had gotten. A real boogeyman. No different than the disgusting adults back in his day.

And just like them, deep down, he wanted to <strong>crush</strong> Lachlan. He wanted to be a big bad bully. Power felt good, doubly so when you were exerting it on someone as smug and confident as his Master. If anything, he should praise Lachlan for taking it so well: He was acquiescing without bowing down. Accepting his Servant&#39;s bullying without admitting defeat. What had Bill done in comparison? Take the abuse until he got sick of it and found a gun?

If success bred contempt, then power bred corruption. Being an outlaw felt good. Being strong felt good. The concerns of the weak were slowly dissipating in the back of your mind, making you forget about your origins. Bill always saw Lachlan and Roland as similar to him. Lesser versions of him. Baby chicks that had yet to grow. The idea of growing them into prized roosters, his own sons...It appealed to some part of him.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128065872196554762 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128065872196554762><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 3:51 PM">3:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

Why did Lachlan keep him around again? He had every reason to sever the contract. Bill had even expected it. Yet Archer was still around, his mana reserves intact and his Master&#39;s Command Seals unused. Bill couldn&#39;t understand it, but Roland had already given him the answer: <strong>Bill was Lachlan&#39;s last chance.</strong> His last chance to win the Grail. His only opportunity to prove that he was worthy of the crest, the family name, his dad&#39;s respect.

It didn&#39;t matter if Bill was a rusty, piece of shit, defective, junky, bargain bin of a gun. So long as that was the only weapon at Lachlan&#39;s disposal, the boy would use it. That was simply how a Dowling was born and raised. So long as he could use Bill, he would endure any form of torture and bullying.

He had underestimated his Master. Just like he had many times before. Lachlan was strong. He was worthy of his attention and respect. Roland was right: Bill loved running away. From school, from his parents, from responsibility and from the authorities. It was easier to be on your own than to put yourself in others shoes.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1128065898985558047 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1128065898985558047><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 10, 2023 3:51 PM">3:51 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>

He would have been tempted to take it easy on his poor, scrawny opponent, were it not for the glare in Lachlan&#39;s eyes. He had seen plenty of chefs and assistants in his life, and those eyes always spelled out trouble. People with huge egos that weren&#39;t any good in the kitchen. Always wanted to be in charge of their own recipes.

&quot;Best out of three, was it?&quot; He asked with a jiggle of the pecs. &quot;Sounds good to me. Let me just set the stage.&quot; He pushed the register aside, made a little bit more room, and within seconds the arm wrestling ring had been formed. His elbow rested on the counter, on top of a soft rag to make it less painful for both contestants. His palm laid open, waiting for Lachlan to wrap his own around it.

The atmosphere narrowed. It felt like the entire store had disappeared save for that one corner in the room. Only two people were present: Lachlan and his opponent.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>&lt;I&#39;ll show you that I&#39;m much more than a stray bullet.

He had been holding his act together thus far, making sure that his telepathic conversations with Bill remained a secret from the shop owner. In order to do that, he had made sure to engage the Donut Daddy in as much trashtalking as possible. Holding two conversations simultaneously wasn&#39;t particularly difficult for him; easy, even, considering he usually had to entertain far more guests in his mind while carrying on with his daily functions.

And usually, conversations followed a logical flow, with one thought leading to the next. Telltale patterns told him what to expect, and guided his responses. 

Not with Bill though. This rough, intense figure, so exceedingly provocative and angry for his supposed age. The sudden shift in his attitude, as if he was trying to extend a helping hand through the mess he had caused, was a bit much. It was overwhelming. More so than dealing with his explosive tempers or even facing an enemy Master.

Come to think of it, Lachlan himself had never received much guidance in anything since that unfortunate incident a decade ago. He had mostly stayed on the sidelines, observing with his eyes and learning from imitation. He had become quite good at parsing secondhand knowledge as a result, but how exactly did one react to being taught?

Mysterious.

Then a fleeting thought crossed his mind: perhaps he could find out with Bill. A stupid thought, that, considering that he hadn&#39;t even planned to take this game seriously...

&lt;I don&#39;t think confidence alone will get me far,&gt; he blurted out suddenly. &lt;Once the countdown&#39;s over, I&#39;m done for.&gt;

...it didn&#39;t stop him from getting flustered, though. It turned out that he did care about the game, if only because his arm was at stake. Probably also because wounded pride hurt more than an wounded arm, but that wasn&#39;t something he would admit.

Patissiers always kept their hands clean!), he wrapped an unwilling hand around it in a rather feeble grip. To both Bill and the shop owner, it looked more like a casual handshake. He hadn&#39;t even lowered his elbow, until Bill nudged him to do so.

&lt;I know how this works,&gt; Lachlan said defensively. &lt;I&#39;m not an idiot.&gt;

But he slowly lowered his elbow onto the counter all the same. The other hand he didn&#39;t know what to do with, and after a moment of deep contemplation, he resorted to the simplest solution available—stuffing it back into his coat pocket.

&lt;Like that, right?&gt; He added, with a bit of uncertainty. If nothing else, he should at least present a professional image before the Donut Daddy. Psych him out with mind games. That was how Bill intended for him to win, right?

The cowboy couldn&#39;t help it! How was he supposed to trust in Lachlan when he kept sounding so scared?

<em>&lt;-Oof, sorry. Anyway, yeah. You got it.&gt;</em> The cowboy reassured his Master once they asked about proper arm positioning. To tell the truth, it looked awkward, like an alien had invaded Lachlan&#39;s skin and was now pretending to be human. He had never seen someone reach so tentatively for a person&#39;s arm like that, as if they had never held the arm wrestling position before. Maybe it was just nerves.

He left that train of thought once Lachlan asked for more advice, adding a bit of mockery as well. Bill, unimpressed, cast him a tired side glance. <em>&lt;Harr harr. Yeah, I got quite a bit to say actually. Listen up and listen closely: Ya want to <strong>pull</strong>, not push. Pull. Ya get me? Pull the hand towards that scrawny lil&#39; chest of yours.&gt;</em> Bill mimicked the motion in the distance, far away from the eyes of the Donut Daddy, whose grip on Lachlan&#39;s hand was intensifying.

<em>&lt;Weight is strength, and I&#39;ve seen ya eat enough donuts and sweets to know that ya have plenty of fat down there.&gt;</em> This sounded like a joke, but Bill&#39;s tone wasn&#39;t even mocking.

Not because the sport turned out to be just tad bit more convoluted than he had expected, but the fact that Bill seemed to be metaphorically slapping himself on the mouth as he tried to take on the role of an arm wrestling coach. It seemed that the man was rather busy wrestling with a side of him that rarely showed.

And the delivery all felt so bizarre to Lachlan, to the point that it made him his the &#39;pause&#39; button on his suspicions.

&lt;I have to admit, coming from you, that actually sounds like reasonable advice,&gt; he said, a little bewildered, as he thought about all the previous occasions when Archer&#39;s &#39;brilliant ideas&#39; had landed them in trouble. &lt;It&#39;s...<strong>weird.</strong>&gt;

What a nice way to acknowledge Bill for his help!

Still, the puppeteer followed the Archer&#39;s instructions to a T. Or, as precisely as his imagination allowed. Who would have thought that the key to winning an arm wrestling match was to transform it into a strange tug-of-war instead?

&lt;Should&#39;ve stuffed Pyg in my clothes if you&#39;re looking for a heavyweight champion,&gt; he commented rather snidely. Though, the idea of dragging his opponent down to his level did have a certain appeal. As the Donut Daddy began the countdown, Lachlan flashed him a harmless grin. &#39;Just giving you a moment to compose yourself,&#39; he lied effortlessly, then, as the word &#39;go!&#39; barely left the shop owner&#39;s mouth, gave the man&#39;s beefy arm <em>everything</em> he got.

There wasn&#39;t much, regrettably.

Muscles bulged, but they belonged to his opponent rather than himself. The shape of Lachlan&#39;s upper arm was disappointing, its twig-like curvature barely changing even as he exerted more and more strength. Oh, he was genuinely giving it his all, despite the odds!

But Donut Daddy&#39;s arm remained immovable.

His confidence turned into anxiousness as Bill could notice faint traces of sweat on the man&#39;s forehead. The mind link between the two felt like a garbled mess, the result of one-sided stress on one&#39;s part. Bill felt as cool as ice, so the only one who could be causing that was Lachlan himself. What was going on? Were the rules too complicated for the boss? Was he losing faith in Bill&#39;s advice? Or maybe-

<em>&quot;that actually sounds like reasonable advice. It&#39;s...weird.&quot;</em>

Even worse. Praise that might as well be seen as an insult for all Bill could care. Lachlan had treated him the same way one would treat a jammed, rusty gun that managed to hit its target. An occasional miracle from God.

<em>&lt;...The fuck do you mean weird, ya corncob?&gt;</em> He grinded his teeth, wishing to say more, only for Donut Daddy to start the counter. No time to rain down on Lachlan&#39;s parade. <em>&lt;Don&#39;t matter, just pull! Yer doin&#39; well! Keep it up!&gt;</em>

And pull Lachlan did. Poorly. Instead of using his arms, he used his chest, dragging himself towards the counter and failing to exert his biceps. He was losing his balance by his poor posture and motion, causing Donut Daddy to even pause as they couldn&#39;t believe that the kid was doing. Why was Bill being so optimistic? Even a blind man could tell that this fight&#39;s outcome had already been decided.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, July 16, 2023 1:12 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Donut Daddy delivered the finishing blow, dragging Lachlan&#39;s palm to the edge of the counter. It didn&#39;t hurt, since he felt enough pity to be gentle, but the scar it left on Lachlan&#39;s pain was intense. What came next, however, would be even worse...

Not just the fact that he had been defeated so completely, but his opponent had even <em>taken pity</em> on him as he pressed his hand gently onto the counter. Donut Daddy felt as if he was doing Lachlan a favor; a compassionate, refined gent being considerate towards a kid who didn&#39;t seem to know the first thing about arm wrestling. There was no glory in beating a complete novice, after all.

Lachlan pulled his hand out from under the Daddy&#39;s and looked down at it. It was still trembling from the effort he had exerted, that had been so easily squashed by the pastry chef. He felt the weight of Donut Daddy&#39;s eyes on him, and it so easily betrayed the man&#39;s thoughts: he had just beaten a clueless kid, invalidated his efforts, and shattered his confidence.

&#39;...No,&#39; Lachlan replied quietly, as if to corroborate Donut Daddy&#39;s doubts. &#39;I&#39;ve never done it before.&#39; He retracted his gaze from Bill and looked up at the pastry chef. A pout began to form on his face. &#39;What&#39;s it to you, anyway?&#39;

He immediately drew up his defenses, shaking out his sore wrist before folding his arms in front of him. &#39;So what if I didn&#39;t? Didn&#39;t know I had be a pro before challenging you to a stupid game like this.&#39;

And so he rambled, offering one excuse after another. Too much work. Too many other commitments. Too little time to play. A disgruntled and entitled brat he presented himself to be, calling the game <em>&#39;a waste of time&#39;</em> to mask his embarrassment at losing without his opponent even breaking a sweat. 

What a sore loser!

&lt;...For now, wipe that shit-eating grin off your face. You and I, we&#39;re going to talk about this when it&#39;s over.&gt; 

He shot Bill a warning, fixing the cowboy with an indignant scowl that screamed <em>&#39;Look what you made me do!&#39;</em> as if he was blaming the Archer for roping him into this hopeless game...

As if to reply in kind, Lachlan immediately put up his defenses, replying to the chef&#39;s insensitive question with acidic remarks. &quot;It was just a question. Relax. I got a son of my own and even he arm wrestled with his fellow friends in kindergarten.&quot; Donut Daddy scoffed, his words not helping at all.

In reality, it was the best position for one to be in. Overlooked and ignored, much like a gunslinger in the shadows. Overconfidence was a slow and insidious killer, which Bill would soon demonstrate.

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t look at me like that.&gt;</em> Bill avoided eye contact as Lachlan glared him in a mixture of anger and embarrassment. <em>&lt;The tips I gave ya were accurate. They are the ones I use. Yer just a bit skinny is all. Do ya exercise enough?&gt;</em> He joked, which didn&#39;t help at all. What was the point of giving Lachlan that faint glimmer of hope, then?

...What was he getting at?

What was all that horseshit about winning &#39;with your own strength?&#39;

<em>&lt;I&#39;m not harming nobody.&gt;</em> Bill giggled, his hand finally reaching for his bulge and taking out his iconic pistol.

Donut Daddy had no chance of foreseeing an attack from a Servant.

But then Bill changed his trajectory, pointing towards the kitchen instead. Specifically, where freshly baked donuts were stored and left to cool for a bit before they were ready to be served. His intention was clear.

<em>&lt;Ya did a great job, kid. He&#39;s feeling so much pity for you that it makes me sick.&gt;</em> Bill giggled, though there was a hint of malice within. <em>&lt;At the end of the day, people are still the same, be it a hundred or even a thousand years in the future!

To Donut Daddy, it all seemed like some privileged kid getting angry at his companion for setting him up. With the realization that the bet was going nowhere, the two had turned to some sort of silent infighting, as they were now one step closer to losing their wager.

Alas, if only the pastry chef could eavesdrop on the devious conversation unfolding in the narrow space between these two customers...

&lt;Of course, how <em>could</em> I have thought so lowly of you?&gt; Lachlan chimed in sarcastically. &lt;For a moment there, I almost mistook you for a thug who wouldn&#39;t bat an eye before shooting someone&#39;s brains out.&gt; He would have rolled his eyes if he could. But unlike Bill, who was currently shamelessly abusing his servant Skill and flashing his gun in front of Donut Daddy as if he were blind, Lachlan had no means of disguising himself in broad daylight. So, he had to relent.

He turned his attention to Donut Daddy. &lt;I can&#39;t exactly stop you from doing what you&#39;re going to do,&gt; he said as he stretched his fingers in front of his opponent, making a show of preparing for the next, albeit hopeless match. &lt;You want me to put on a performance? I&#39;ll give you a performance. But, if it were up to me...&gt;

&lt;...I&#39;d aim for something higher.&gt;

He gripped the Donut Daddy&#39;s hand with his own. &lt;Hold your fire,&gt; he ordered Archer, then, before Donut Daddy could initiate the countdown, swiftly pulled the rag out from under their elbows with his other hand.

The rag went in the exact opposite direction of Donut Daddy&#39;s arm, causing his elbow to give out and slide towards Lachlan, much in the same fashion of someone who had their knees kicked in from behind. Riding the momentum, Lachlan exerted some strength into his wrestling hand, and forced Donut Daddy&#39;s hand down onto the counter with barely any resistance.

He was now putting his entire weight onto his arm, and applying as much pressure as he could to keep his opponent pinned. It was by all means a terrible posture, far worse than what he had exhibited when Bill first gave him the instructions.

The scorn felt palpable, the prized heir&#39;s words dripping with sarcasm and accompanied by judgmental glares. Bill didn&#39;t help things either, waving his gun around behind Donut Daddy like a cartoon character, putting a finger before his lips to <em>shush</em> his Master as he carefully explained his masterwork of a plan.

<em>&lt;I&#39;m glad we see eye to eye.&gt;</em> Bill joked, ready to proceed. He knew the boy maybe expected a bit more, but hey, they were getting treated to his services instead! There was no reason to see that as a betrayal. If anything, Bill was going the extra mile to be helpful, making sure that his Master knew exactly what he was up to. How could Lachlan even complain about that?

Actually, yes. He could see Lachlan complaining. Anything that implied that he needed assistance was a taboo.

<em>&lt;Hold your fire.&gt;</em> His Master ordered, their voice already sounding like an ill omen. Bill narrowed his eyes, hoping that Lachlan wasn&#39;t planning anything silly. He had already experienced plenty of chaos back when he was chasing Pyg. He didn&#39;t need any more of that.

<em>&lt;Just stop, will ya? I&#39;m just helping ya out-&gt;</em> Bill tried to interject, but to his surprise, Lachlan had already made their move.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

That&#39;s not to say that he happy, however, since his elbow suddenly felt weightless as Lachlan pushed down on his drumstick of an arm.

&quot;That&#39;s not-!&quot; Fair? Was that what he wanted to say? He could toss those words off a cliff for what Lachlan cared, since the Dowling was fully intent on winning this second round with his own strength. He pushed down and hard, using whatever force that scrawny body of his had. The chef&#39;s muscles were still heating up, unlike Lachlan who was already burning in flames.

Lachlan sent him smug remarks, flaunting how his actions had turned Bill&#39;s so-called &#39;perfect plan&#39; into a flawless scheme. If Lachlan won this, it was obvious who Donut Daddy would direct his ire towards. How could he not, when the Dowling was doing such a great job at making themselves look awful? Poor posture, poor attitude, little to no strength. It was hard for anyone to love this kid at all. Even Bill felt pissed off: He had spent those last few minutes describing his plan in detail, and now he got told to wait his turn?!

If he was still in a gang, he might have shot at anyone trying to upstage them. Lachlan was treading dangerous ground and Bill&#39;s fingers were still on his pistol.

Then why did the cowboy feel a tingle in his heart? Why did his chest swell so far and wide? He felt almost proud, to see someone snatch his plan and mold it into something new. A partner in crime.

<em>&lt;...The hell are ya doing?!&gt;</em> He shouted, but Lachlan could catch the faint glimpse of a smile underneath that mask. <em>&lt;Ya trying to coddle him to death? Push! Push! Fucking, push!&gt;</em> Bill said, the antithesis to his explanation from last round.

<em>&lt;Yer not using your chest anymore, so fuck pulling. Just push him outta there! He&#39;s struggling!&gt;</em> Bill said, pointing towards Donut Daddy&#39;s arm. It had already lost its balance due to the pulled rug, meaning that even the slightest force could make the chef slip off the counter. Ironically, the man&#39;s large limbs worked against him in this scenario, since that just meant it was easier to push their elbow out of the way. If Lachlan couldn&#39;t fully push the man&#39;s arm down, surely a ring out would still count as his victory? <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He grunted with exertion. Straining his arm, leaning in way too much as he forced the pastry chef&#39;s arm down, then forward, and back down again, trying whatever angle seemed like it could budge more. His muscles were on fire, his shoulder felt like they might pop any second, and he panted from the immense effort, unable to keep his breathing under control.

Even a simplistic game like arm wrestling was enough to turn him into a wreck, but that didn&#39;t matter. Donut Daddy&#39;s arm had already been bent at an unfavorable angle, limiting the ways in which he could efficiently apply his strength. At Bill&#39;s encouragement, Lachlan shifted his body sideways, and started shoving with the help of his upper arm.

If he could just push the pastry chef over the edge, if he could strip his elbow of its only support...then there would be no chance of a comeback. His mind was bursting with snarky insults as Donut Daddy called him out on the foul play, but he feared that the moment he wasted precious breath to speak, he would lose all that momentum he had built up. So he directed his thoughts towards his overzealous partner in crime instead.

<em>&lt;Do something!&gt;</em> He roared in Bill&#39;s mind. <em>&lt;No, scratch that, say something! Use that irritating tongue of yours, for fuck&#39;s sake, get under his skin and make him lose his composure!&gt;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132009721461743737 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132009721461743737><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 21, 2023 1:02 PM">1:02 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

His plan was solid, so solid that Lachlan had caught on to it minutes ago. The problem relied in the execution, since his Master&#39;s muscles were nonexistent and his form had seen better days. The pastry chef was caught off guard, sure, but was still a lumbering beefcake that probably weighed twice as much as Lachlan.

Bill&#39;s fingers fidgeted with the pistol in his hand. It would be so easy to do something about this, but was that what Lachlan wanted? Did he want to be saved like a damsel in distress?

Apparently yes, not, maybe? A thought crossed Bill&#39;s mind and he realized that even though the Dowling was in dire straits, his cogs were constantly turning. The solution was simple, efficient, and best of all, Bill could enjoy doing it.

<em>&lt;Can do.&gt;</em> He grinned, flashing a smile back to Lachlan as he casually waltzed into the kitchen, whistling a tune to catch the two&#39;s attention. Donut Daddy was focused on holding his ground, but even he couldn&#39;t help but notice the shadowy figure walk past the counter and worm their arms into where delicious pastries were being stored.

&quot;Ya don&#39;t mind if I sample some, do ya, chef?&quot; Bill giggled, grabbing several donuts in his hand and scarfing them down in an instant. Custard and chocolate dribbled down the counter as Donut Daddy witnessed his hard work being consumed with no reward. Three bucks. Seven bucks. It was all adding up...</span></div></div></div></div></div>

&quot;Chef...Is that a fly in my donut? In that sweet custard cream? Tsk tsk tsk tsk.&quot; Bill wagged his finger with a critical tone. &quot;I can hardly believe it...&quot;

But then <em>he</em> appeared. The Picky Customer™️. Clad in red and black, he was the grim reaper of donuts himself, running his hands all over those heavenly treats while giving them the death sentence they didn&#39;t deserve.

Flies, in his donuts?!

&lt;You&#39;re killing my appetite, Bill!&gt; Lachlan jabbed at Bill with telepathy, swatting him much in the same way Bill had swatted that fly out of the air. &lt;Could&#39;ve at least gone for something inorganic, like a rubber band or something.&gt;

But nevertheless, the absurd accusation pushed Donut Daddy over the edge. For the briefest of moments, his posture slackened. He turned his body towards Bill, petrified and stunned.

&#39;Gotcha!&#39; Lachlan seized the opportunity and twisted his arm inwards, slamming the pastry chef&#39;s arm on the counter.

It was a weak slam, barely making the backside of Donut Daddy&#39;s arm kiss the glass countertop. But a win was still a win. Lachlan let out a breath he&#39;d been holding for far too long, then released his hand before slumping onto the counter. &#39;I win.&#39;

Smugness, so much smugness. &#39;Thought you could win without even focusing on me, did you?&#39; He wiped sweat from his brow. &#39;I told you not to underestimate me,&#39; he said with unnecessary flair, as if he had conveniently forgotten that it was him who had rigged the second match from the start.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 10:49 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132441293025460345 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132441293025460345><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 22, 2023 5:37 PM">5:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a quick and shocking defeat. One second, Donut Daddy was clawing at Bill from a distance, trying to slap a donut out of the cowboy&#39;s hands. The next, his own arm was crashed down on the counter, followed by Lachlan&#39;s smug grin.

The man pulled his arm back, palm slipping underneath Lachlan&#39;s own as he stared at the kid and their Servant with contempt. &quot;YOU! Get out of the kitchen this instant! I&#39;ll call the police if you keep stealing my food without paying!&quot; Their voice cracked, clearly at their limit. &quot;And you, what makes you think that even counts? Do you think I&#39;m blind? That I didn&#39;t see what you just did?!&quot;

He lifted the rag that Lachlan had discarded and shoved it into his face. He then slammed it down on the counter, arms crossed on top of it as he stared the boy down.

&quot;Let me teach you a lesson then.&quot; He raised his arm, ready for a round three. &quot;You cheat again, I&#39;ll snap your wrist. I&#39;m serious.&quot; He grumbled, filled with ire. A more reasonable person would have stayed true to their statement. It would have been easy to just declare the game null and void, say something about how the great Donut Daddy didn&#39;t play with cheaters. Instead, the pastry chef clearly wanted to demolish Lachlan after this little incident, and what better way of doing that than keeping the game going and destroying him with pure strength?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His job there was done after all. All he had to do now was shoot the final bullet, which would be far more delicious than any donut in the world.

&quot;Aye aye, sir.&quot; Bill replied with a burp, leaving the kitchen and letting Donut Daddy go on with his tirade. <em>&lt;Chill out, boss. I just grabbed a random fly and put it in me mouth. Yer donuts are fine.&gt;</em> Archer sighed. <em>&lt;Ya got more important things to think about than food anyway. You&#39;ve pissed him off.&gt;</em>

It took everything it could for Bill to refrain from laughing at Lachlan&#39;s performance. It was exquisite and daring, especially the finishing touch: By talking down to the pastry chef, he wasn&#39;t just being the typical arrogant Dowling heir. He was making himself a target as well, a target for the Donut Daddy&#39;s current ire. It would have been all too easy for Bill to become the focus of the chef&#39;s mind, but Lachlan was quick to snip that thought in the bud.

Bill had to give him credit. How long had Lachlan grown accustomed to this way of speaking? Was it something he learned from his family, or himself? Part of him felt jealous. Jealous at those skills. It would have helped him a lot back in the day...

Oh well, no use crying over spilt milk, like mama always said. Bill laughed, despite things being in a rough spot for Lachlan. The third round should be a breeze, since the chef&#39;s attention was now fully directed towards his Master. However, rage was a powerful drug. It was what let him cheat death twice, after all. Could a distraction be enough to let Lachlan overpower the anger of a well-built muscle?

Bill giggled to himself. Why was he doubting that? Of course his Master would be able to beat that. They had the best gunslinger in the West around them, after all. There was no point in worrying.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1132705765140987945 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1132705765140987945><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, July 23, 2023 11:08 AM">11:08 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;Now tell me, would ya rather I shoot the ones filled with custard, or cream, or, dare I say, chocolate?&gt;</em> Bill asked, snorting as he tilted his head towards the kitchen.

I&#39;d rather we leave the donuts intact. Why settle for just one when you can take them all?&gt;

Lachlan made a gesture with his hand like he was snatching everything from an invisible shelf. Though to the Donut Daddy, he simply appeared to be stretching his overtaxed hand and wrist. It was easy to disguise his intentions, considering he <em>was</em> sweating like mad and panting quite heavily after his previous stunt.

&lt;Either go big or go home, right?&gt; He suggested shamelessly to Bill. &lt;Why target the poor donuts, when you can mess up those beauties on the top shelf?&gt;

He was referring to the sugar-spun roses, of course. One glance and anyone could tell that their intricate form required meticulous craftsmanship only a professional could achieve. How much time had Donut Daddy spent perfecting them? It also felt plain <em>evil</em>, to subject them to a brutal massacre. Surely, even someone as crude as Bill and as spoiled as Lachlan would have an eye for appreciating such works of art?

&lt;Candy roses, fruit tarts, pastries. Everything on that shelf is a bitch to make. You&#39;re going to absolutely <em>murder</em> him.&gt; Lachlan offered an unexpected nugget of wisdom. It seemed that he was quite knowledgeable in the domain of sweets and baked goods.

&#39;Who said I was cheating?&#39; He turned his attention back to the pastry chef next, still maintaining his unapologetic demeanor. &#39;This is my first time playing the game, remember? I don&#39;t recall you saying anything about only allowing me to compete with <em>one</em> arm?&#39; He asked innocently, playing up the bratty role with much gusto.

&#39;But hey, I&#39;m magnanimous. I&#39;ll forgive you this once, since winning put me in a good mood.&#39; He reached out with his dominant hand this time. &#39;Let&#39;s switch hands.

Bill paused, invaded by a string of thoughts that burnt his mind aflame and lit a match within him. The roads started to merge and the cogs were put into place. He looked up, far above the pile of donuts and pastries that he was aiming at, and saw the collection of precious and delectable items that Donut Daddy had made throughout his store&#39;s lifetime. Handcrafted and one of a kind, of course.

He knew how people reacted when their greatest treasure was stolen away from them. No amount of money could buy back the time and effort that the pastry chef had put into those sugary sculptures. Bill&#39;s confusion turned into a wicked, despicable grin.

He was going to ruin this man&#39;s life.

<em>&lt;Yer a devil.&gt;</em> Bill chuckled. <em>&lt;I like ya. Very much so, Mistah Dowling.&gt;</em> He replied back with some playfulness, and Lachlan would be relieved at seeing the angle in Bill&#39;s aim change. It was clear what he was aiming for now.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

They waffled on, Lachlan forgetting more than half of their turgid and uninspired words. How often had he heard people talk up big game, unaware that their destiny had already been decided for them?

Nowhere as near as his father, for sure. But, at least now he could be one step closer, and act like a real Dowling.

&quot;Good, I&#39;m not right handed anyway.&quot; The chef revealed with a smirk, taking Lachlan&#39;s offer to switch sides. He probably felt like that statement would unnerve his opponent, but was met by the same, bored gaze. It ticked him off even more. Lachlan could notice the palpitating muscles. The redness in the man&#39;s skin. They were irate.

Good. It would make this even sweeter.

The two palms met. They were now connected and ready to throw down. After a few seconds, it began.

Lachlan was outmatched, of course. Donut Daddy made sure to not rest on a rag this time around, along with keeping their free arm within range, ready to pounce at Lachlan&#39;s fingers and snap them if he tried anything funny. The Dowling was no match for the man&#39;s brute strength.

<em>CRASH!</em>

He didn&#39;t need to be.

&quot;HUH?!&quot; Donut Daddy shouted with powerful lungs and resonating timbre. But how could that ever feel intimidating with a face like that? His eyes watery and his lips jittery. He could only stare in shock as the glass covering protecting the items on the top shelf had broken into bits, its items falling down like a pile of dominos and shattering on the cold kitchen floor.

He looked so pathetic with that weepy face. Once hot muscles suddenly went cold. His wrist was barely there.

&quot;How could this-&quot; He kept asking himself, but would never receive the answer that he was looking for. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

No, none of those. A puppeteer was ever only as strong as their strongest puppet. Their truth strength lies in their most powerful asset, whenever it was operating at its best.

Bill would always be Lachlan&#39;s greatest asset. 

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

The roses shattered, exploding into a myriad of sugary glitters as they met Bill&#39;s silent bullets. Donut Daddy&#39;s life work, obliterated in an instant. The man&#39;s pain was palpable, as his core seemed to tear and shatter at the sight of his precious creations reduced to fine dust. 

The atrocity was akin to besmirching the great Mona Lisa by pouring ketchup on the canvas, or disgracing the famed Water Lilies by setting them ablaze. No one could watch the Louvre burn without shedding a tear. <em>No one.</em>

Lachlan laughed. 

It was pure joy born out of spite, an almost childish gloating that came from witnessing a house of cards collapse in on itself. There was no beauty in fragility, and Lachlan proved it alongside Bill&#39;s fiendish stunt. With renewed vigor, he gripped Donut Daddy&#39;s hand tight and pushed it down onto the counter.

<em>SLAM!</em>

There was little resistance. All the light seemed to have gone out of the baker&#39;s eyes, and all the fight seemed to have left him. Lachlan might as well have been dealing with a corpse at this point, and oh boy, was <em>that</em> his forte.

&#39;What did I tell ya?&#39; He couldn&#39;t resist kicking the dog while it was down. Meanwhile, Bill received the his telepathic message.

<em>&lt;Right back at you,&gt;</em> the Dowling heir dusted off his metaphorical shoulder, before pulling his hand from Donut Daddy&#39;s cold, clammy grip. His arms ached from the effort, and as the high of victory subsided, he gradually began to realize how deeply he had entangled himself in this unnecessary game.

The bullet that had caused this was long gone, dissolved into mana as its owner appreciated the scenery that they had just caused. Destroyed shelves, glass strewn upon and broken roses. Even better was Donut Daddy, who appeared to be too crestfallen to speak.

To destroy someone&#39;s treasure with no rhyme or reason was the very definition of power. They would never forget you. Anywhere they went, they would constantly remember the scars you had inflicted upon them. Bill had done this many times over and was certain that the pastry chef would no longer know them as everyday customers.

This was the type of sweetness that Lachlan appreciated.

<em>&lt;Of course it would work. What did I tell ya?&gt;</em> Bill grinned in his inner sanctum, basking in Lachlan&#39;s joy. Those positive feelings were infectious, making the outlaw&#39;s heart flutter a bit. He might not fully understand his Master, but he was glad he found someone who understood the sweetness of crushing others.

<em>&lt;And if it&#39;s stupid, even better. Their fault falling for it, dontcha think?&gt;</em> He said, maliciously, as if Donut Daddy deserved such a terrible fate.

&quot;Well, that just happened!&quot; Bill laughed, slapping his knee and getting closer. No reason to stick to the shadows any longer now that the battle was won. &quot;What&#39;s with the wind though? Berenice gotta have a draft problem if yer shelves keep tumbling over from a wee little gust.&quot; He pointed towards an open window, feigning ignorance.

The chef knew that too, removing their arm from the counter and sliding towards the kitchen. Their feet were practically grinding across the floor, the man too devastated to even lift his shoes. He went to a corner, grabbed a large box of sweets, donuts, pastries, whatever they were, and brought them back to the counter. He shoved it in Lachlan&#39;s arms, making sure to exert some force.

&quot;Never come to my store ever again.&quot; He said with the face of an abused animal, trying to sound tough, but too shaken to put their heart into it. &quot;Get out! Now!&quot; A pathetic whimper.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Even Donut Daddy ought to agree that they expected the brat to lose in a matter of seconds. What was Bill getting at?

<strong>&quot;So this box seems rather small.&quot;</strong> Bill added, extending his arm to touch the box. He ran his palm across it, almost as if measuring it. &quot;Say, it&#39;s even smaller than these wide shoulders of yours! Surely my friend deserves a bigger box for all of his effort? Hmm?

&lt;...That&#39;s what my father would say, at any rate.&gt;

The puppeteer immediately fell into silence after uttering that, seemingly absorbed in the box of pastries that the baker had handed to him. As Bill moved in to extort the man even further, Lachlan opened the box to examine his spoils of &#39;war&#39;. An assortment of pastries greeted his eyes, their sweet and sugary aroma teasing his nose.

Today was shaping up to be quite a good day indeed.

So why not make it even better?

With a deceptively sweet smile, Lachlan joined in on Bill&#39;s charade. Instead of confronting the pastry chef head-on like Bill had been doing, he made his way to the back kitchen and started exploring the shelves, like a kid in a candy shop—which wasn&#39;t all that far from the truth, really.

&#39;I think what he meant is that we can have this box and fill it with whatever we want, as long as it fits,&#39; he offered Bill a friendly &#39;hint&#39;, his hands already hard at work as he started stacking donut rings atop one another. &#39;You ever played with Legos before?&#39; He added a rather unhelpful suggestion, unaware that Bill had died well before the invention of the game. &#39;It&#39;s kinda like that.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137446494325186630 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137446494325186630><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 1:06 PM">1:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="resisbeststat">@9 Ball</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Neither Bill nor Lachlan cared about that though. The latter was even perusing the kitchen, grabbing any items that caught their fancy and bringing them back to the box.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Ya mean Tetris?&quot; Bill asked, puzzled. Not as much as Lachlan though, who would wonder why his Servant even knew of videogames in the first place. &quot;Ohhh, I get ya, I get ya. Sounds fine to me. Ya agree, dontcha?&quot; Archer giggled, tugging at Donut Daddy&#39;s collar. The chef quietly acquiesced, letting Lachlan stack as many items as he wanted in the box. It was looking a lot tighter now, but still sealed enough to carry.

Eventually, once they had their fill, they headed outside. The sign on the shop also changed from OPEN to CLOSED. How curious.

&quot;We gave him a proper scare. I&#39;d say he&#39;s probably gonna dream of us for the rest of his pathetic life.&quot; Bill laughed, as if the despair in the chef&#39;s face tasted a lot sweeter than the donut in his hand right now. &quot;That&#39;s the problem with physical strength only. Once ya meet <em>real</em> strength, ya don&#39;t know how to cope.&quot;

He cast a side glance to Lachlan.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d know more about that. Heheh. Now, where to?&quot; He asked, not wanting to get assaulted by another horde of taxi drivers. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" title="natmeg">@Nat</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
