Flames wrapped around her legs as they jet her forward, that being was way too fast and durable. If there was a silver linning was that she didn&#39;t need to aim while running so she could keep moving without slowing down. 

Yet that wasn&#39;t much of a help. bullets bounce of it as it were just gum and the fire projectiles burn the skin but the burn were still superficial. 

&quot;You damn monster&quot; was all she could say in defiance even when she knew that admitting it outloud did nothing to solve that problem. 

Then as the flames boost stopped so she did, she honestly had no idea if she had a way to deal with this besides Supay but she had been moving for a while hopefully they had moved away enough to not get in Saber&#39;s way. 

She turned and right as she did she could tell that even with her flames boosting her speed the beast had been able to easily be able to keep up. Still something felt off, unlike the last time the beast wasn&#39;t as erratic she couldn&#39;t help but think something was off but regardless Pygmalion power and speed were no different from the last time.

Another gamble, that could be the summary of her life one gamble after another and while she hadn&#39;t always win she had avoided to lose so far but luck can only last so long. She just hoped it would last just enough.

&quot;Ignia!!&quot; she yelled as a crimson fiery fist came from her side aiming to smash Pyg&#39;s face head on.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The earth trembled beneath the weight of this colossal beast, each of its footsteps echoing like a giant gong had been smashed. Its eyes fixated themselves on Gloria, as the dozen minds scattered throughout its body remained unified with a singular thought.

<em><strong>Strike, and kill.</strong></em>

For the first time since its creation, its brains sang in unison, perhaps as a side effect of donning Lindwyrm&#39;s armor. The Dragon&#39;s hide had done more than to bolster its defenses; it seemed to have altered Pyg&#39;s mind in some way, stripping away some of its autonomy in exchange for an unwavering concentration. A Berserker&#39;s mindscape, in a sense. 

What would happen if a non-Servant were forcibly subjected to the effects of Mad Enhancement? Even Pyg itself doesn&#39;t know, as it no longer had the capacity to hold council among its own minds.

<strong>Twenty more meters. Ten more meters.</strong> 

Pyg easily outpaced Gloria. No matter how swiftly the woman&#39;s legs and magecraft carried her, exhaustion would eventually take its toll, even in the subtlest ways. A suboptimal exchange of breath, an uneven footstep...Gloria was not a machine, her human nature meant that she had to adjust for the environment, account for obstacles. And because of that, her speed fluctuated.

But Pyg, a mass of flesh born out of malice, remained impervious to such concerns. Risks of injuries from erratic movements such as sprained ankles or scraped knees were completely disregarded; after all, what repercussions could possibly penetrate its superhuman toughness?

<strong>Five more meters. Two.</strong>

There was nowhere for Gloria to run. And the woman seemed to have realized that as well, as rather than increasing her speed further, she stopped in the wake of Pyg&#39;s looming shadow, and called upon the ace up her sleeve.

<em><strong>CRASH!</strong></em>

Even with just a partial summon, the giant&#39;s flaming arm squashed the puppet&#39;s face, causing it to halt its approach. Gloria continued to push; she could almost imagine it happen, just like last time, where Pyg&#39;s flesh eventually melted under Supay&#39;s relentless heat. This was a battle of attrition. She had to kindle her tiny flame and nourish it into a roaring fire in order to consume the creature whole—

Pyg let out an earth shattering roar. Inch by inch, it craned its neck to gaze back at Gloria, and Gloria only noticed then that there was a distinct lack of the smell of burning flesh. Orange white light danced across Pyg&#39;s skin, which appeared just a touch different, a touch rougher from human skin, as if it had been tempered with.

Had the puppeteer done something to Pyg?

There would be no time to speculate, however. Pyg immediately retaliated, an eye for an eye, and an arm for an arm. It pulled its own arm back, before swinging it forward and locking the half-summoned Supay in a fierce arm wrestling match. Its aim? 

To pin Supay, along with Gloria, to the ground.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135609570618785823 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135609570618785823><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 11:27 AM">11:27 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

While she still though the brat had something wrong in its head and find his magecraft disgusting to say the least that didn&#39;t improve her own options.  That beast which had been pursuing her was something she had no way of beating it. 

Whenever she used regular bullets or fire projectiles the situation wouldn&#39;t improve and so there was no other choice but for her to use her last resort. 

When the fiery fist impacted she had already resolved herself, she had fight it before she knew how to deal with it. She knew that he needed to keep pushing without giving it a single second and overwhelm him before she exhausted herself. In theory it was a perfect plan, as the first blow landed the rest of the supay began to materialize without even the need of her to call out her name. 

This was another gamble, could she beat the beast before her time run out?

Yet even she could try to bet her life the other side had already upped her up. As she tried to find a solution to her current situation, she failed to notice the odd feeling for when the fist first impact her. Something was off, as blow after blow came into Pyg head she began to notice what was wrong. 

&quot;No...&quot; was all she could say before she was pinned into the ground.

Her mind was thrown into disarray, her plan smashed into pieces before she could even enact it and for a single second her mind stopped working. Time seeming to stop still as she looked at the dark sky as she found herself unable to come up with. 

Supay was her ace in the hole if Pyg could now resist its flames did she had any other optiong but to just accept dead laying down?? 

NO

NO

NO!!!!!

&quot;Supay!!!&quot; her scream could be heard breaking the silence of night. 

Crimson flames burned brightly as more fiery appendages appeared and smashed Pyg face without a care if the flames were to work or not.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Surviving? Living? Neither of those was her reason for fighting, what pushed forward was something so small yet so precious only others like her could understand. 

&quot;If I dont destroy you...&quot; she said as she stared back at the beast as Supay finished forming a fiery wall now standing around her and for the moment protecting her from it. &quot;...You and that brat will threaten <em>his</em> future&quot;

Blood began to trickle under her nose as the newly formed arms continue their assault but the first summoned arm didnt move into attack instead just like Pyg arm had done before he gripped back. No matter what she wasn&#39;t gonna let Pyg run away this time.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The answer was simple, but powerful: if one punch wasn&#39;t enough, then deal another. If one fist wasn&#39;t enough, then add another too. 

Brute force. It was always going to be the best strategy, and with enough of it, even the toughest defense could be worn down. After all, there was no stone that wouldn&#39;t crack, and Pyg was a creature made of flesh and bones. Gloria knew she had to simply, keep trying.

<em><strong>SMASH!</strong></em>

A second fist collided with Pyg&#39;s chest, and Pyg immediately intercepted with its other arm. But then a third arm burst out of the flaming body behind Gloria, and this time, Pyg ran out of arms.

It retaliated with its head.

But then, what of a fourth fist?

The sky was burning. A burst of oranges and reds and whites, dying the darkening sky in a soft, warm, and hazy glow. Supay erupted in its volcanic glory, it was no longer a flicker, but a roaring flame, and it slowly began to circle the colossal puppet like sharks swarming their prey, before ramming into the creature and sending it staggering into a nearby building.

Debris sprayed in all directions. Pyg emerged from the rubble with a rabid howl, its eyes gleaming savagely, saliva dangling from its mouth as it broke into a relentless run. It charged back at Gloria and her flame giant, before pouncing onto them both like an extremely large cat.

It was a simplistic attack, devoid of elegance or strategic finesse. However, in a clash between two giants of absolute strength, all strategy paled in comparison to raw power.

It was bizarre, it was good that no one could see her face  in this moment nor that it would help anyone understand her reasoning. Red covered her entire face as even if it couldn&#39;t be seen blood was coming from every pore of her skin.

She wasn&#39;t focusing on anything, not even in the enemy in front of her. The only thing in her mind was the same thing that had been there since she had started this journey so many years ago. 

<em>My Child</em>

The phrofecy for her clan was which motivated but it wasn&#39;t entirely because of the reasons she claimed. Yes she couldn&#39;t bear her clan suffering being robbed of their way of life due to others actions. Yes she couldn&#39;t bear her family losing more after all the sacrifices they did to keep the village safe and protected. 

<em>My Child</em>

But the main reason which pushed was something more simple. It was that child which she had brought to this world. After learning of their extincintion her first though was towards him 

<em>Please forgive me for bringing you into this world</em>

She wanted to apologize. even if it wasn&#39;t her fault, as in her eyes she had brought that child into a world where he had no future. More than anything that was which brough her the most despair, the idea of her own flesh and blood existing only die.

Supay&#39;s fiery arms continue to smash at Pyg, the flames burned brighter than ever Gloria had no idea if the multiple blow were working nor if her Supay was withstanding. She had already abandoned all idea of defense in order to beat Pyg into a bloody pulp.

It hadn&#39;t been planned but just like Pyg had become more powerful so had Supay</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Yet there something else she realized as she hit Pyg, she was gonna probably die and that was okay for her. She had regrets obviously but she couldnt go at this half heartly but she wasn&#39;t the only one fighting and she didn&#39;t wanted to leave him high and dry.

They landed on Pyg&#39;s face, torso, limbs, tenderizing the skin and causing the underlying muscles to strain and tear. Meanwhile, Pyg&#39;s own fists chipped and cracked Supay&#39;s flaming form, but the damage was quickly repaired as Gloria funneled even more mana into her familiar, rejuvenating its body like a mender smoothing glue over cracked porcelain.

From the start, the notion of <em>punching</em> out a fire seemed absurd. But unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, Pyg cared little for such contrivance. Flames, swords, bullets—everything was the same in their eyes: obstacles, waiting to be pummeled as commanded by their master. Whenever they were lost, whenever they were in trouble, their master&#39;s voice would always be there to guide them, provide them with the necessary instructions...

But not anymore, it seemed.

In the beginning, Pyg could still hear it, distant murmurs that barely penetrated the thick fog in their collective minds. But as abruptly as turning off a faucet, the incessant commands ceased, and Pyg could only grapple in confusion as they felt the strings attached to their body snap off all at once. They had been stumbling through the darkness for so long, and now, instinct told them that they were drawing closer to the tunnel&#39;s end.

And what awaited them at that end?

Not light, it seemed. Pyg&#39;s vision immediately plunged into darkness, as they felt an unprecedented amount of pressure on their skull. Supay ensnared Pyg in a three-armed lock; even as the colossal puppet wildly lashed out with their own fists and sought purchase on what felt like Supay&#39;s form, an enormous heat engulfed him whole. It kept growing, hotter and hotter, past the agony Pyg had endured back in the sewers, and continued to climb.

As her last blow landed and flames exploded in a crimson inferno. The motions finally began to slow down, fist smashed into what before was Pyg before they slowly started to stop. It wasn&#39;t intentional, she had a slow reaction to the lack of resistance. The continous back and forth in their contest of strenght had her basically running on autopilot. 

<em>Crack crack crack</em>

The fiery arms released the puppet as Gloria blinked as even when she understood that the fight was on hold she had yet to fully process what had happened. 

&quot;Urgh!&quot; all of the sudden all of the pain and tiredness hit her at once she cover her mouth with both hands to keep more blood from coming out of her body. 

Cracks began to appear all over Supay, yeah Gloria had been repairing it from all the damage that it sustained from Pyg but that was only momentarily. It was like just putting fresh cement over a crack, it covered it but it didn&#39;t meant that the whole damage had been instantly fixed. But it wasn&#39;t just that, even if she had made it good as new the construction which heavily relied on her mental focus and strenght. The pain and tiredness made the image unstable and so all the damage began to show. 

She took a few seconds to think she wiped the blood out of her face as she looked into the puppet. 

&quot;Its still so ugly...&quot; she said to no one in particular. She began to think what to do now, making Supay dissapear was not an option as she would completely defenseless if she did but Supay range was limited like this. 

She move Supay arms and pushed the burned puppet before she leaned forward to have a closer look aiming to be a 100% sure it was death before doing anything else.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Layers of skin peeled away at the slightest touch, and realization struck Gloria like a bolt of lightning: this scorched, burned, and charred exterior was but a thin veneer of paint overlaid on top of the original work; it had acted as an <em>armor</em>, safeguarding Pyg&#39;s real body from the brunt of Supay&#39;s flames.

<em>rumble...</em>

A deep groan vibrated deep within the colossal puppet&#39;s frame, before an arm—partially caked in soot, and partially revealing unblemished skin—broke away from the rest of the body. It struck Supay head-on, sending the familiar and its master hurtling through the street. 

Followed by another arm. A leg. Then another. Almost like a snake shedding its skin, or a moth breaking out of its chrysalis, Pyg emerged from its confinement, skin untouched by flames, unmarred by the strife of battle...

It seemed that Gloria could not afford to rest yet.

<em><strong>STOMP</strong></em>

No, she could not afford to keep still even for a second! Immediately upon its rebirth, Pyg dug into its hands into the hood of a nearby car, before hurling it at the shaman—not to crush her under its weight, but to bombard her with an explosion should she attempt to retaliate with those scorching flames! It was a crude tactic, as simplistic as a little kid who loved to play with fire, but since when had Pyg known to possess any semblance of intelligence?!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137867876783620207 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137867876783620207><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 6, 2023 5:00 PM">5:00 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

All was a blur, one moment she was looking at the burned corpse of the puppet and in the next one she was nowhere near it. Supay landed on the ground with loud bang. 

Gloria didn&#39;t really felt the impact of whatever hit her, even if cracked the fire giant still did its best to protect her with all it had. Yet her previous outburst had began to show, as she trie to stand up half of the face of the giant fell down and shattered. 

Gloria couldn&#39;t allow herself to distract herself. she was running out of time. Her body felt heavy, even just standing was painful enough for her. All she could see was red, more cracks appears over the body of the avatar of flame Gloria had summoned. It was normal, even if Gloria could muster a strenght similar to that of Pyg she was human. Unlike the puppet she could only keep it going so far before burning out. To keep going was suicide, anyone else would had just tried to use their last remainign strengh to run away live to figt another day.

&quot;You are ugly...&quot; But for Gloria there was no another day. 

Even with the car coming at her Supay stood still

The metal smashed onto the avatar, more cracks appear, the body of the giant began to began to split open, Were Pyg or anyone take a closer look they would be able to see Gloria standing inside of it, the fire barrier which had protected before was slowly crumbling. 

Yet for some reason there was no panic or fear in Gloria&#39;s face. The fiery hands grabbed the car after it smashed into its body and without a pause. Despite how broken it looked Supay flames hadn&#39;t die out, even now they continue to burn as bright as they had so far. 

Supay would throw the car back at Pyg as with another one of its arms a crimsom beam was shot at the puppet.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Pyg&#39;s relentless pursuit had already begun. The car shrieked as it hurtled through the air, but the pupet raised both of their arms—and in a display of rather astonishing agility, <em>vaulted</em> over the vehicle as if they were clearing some kind of obstacle course. They sped towards Gloria, while the car crashed and exploded upon impact with the ground.

Gloria had gone on the defensive, which ended up being an open invitation for Pyg to shift into full offense. What better target could they ask for, really, than a sitting duck immobilized within her own crumbling barrier?

<em><strong>SLAM!</strong></em>

Pyg&#39;s colossal form collided with the barrier, causing more cracks to appear. The skin around their shoulder began to singe a bit at the brief touch—unlike before, it seemed that the protective layer safeguarding the puppet up to this point was no longer there. Gloria was slowly, but surely making progress.

But at what cost?

<em><strong>SLAM!!!</strong></em>

Pyg surged forth once more, this time pounding on Supay&#39;s protective walls with both fists like a giant gorilla. Gloria found herself face-to-face with Pyg&#39;s hideous visage. A monstrous creation they were, with skin an ashen gray and veins as thick as Gloria&#39;s own arms bulging along their limbs. Their beady little eyes sat atop a Frankenstein face that seemed to have been cobbled together from many distinct pieces...

Yet, as the shaman&#39;s gaze bore into the puppet, as this bipedal nightmare&#39;s fists singed and smoked from Supay&#39;s intense heat, a new realization began to take hold. Their expression—which had become scrunched up from the pain, held an unexpected depth. There were emotions hidden within those eyes, and those emotions...

They felt eerily human.

A chilling thought gripped the shaman. Could it be...? The creature she had been facing was neither a familiar, nor a chimera, but...

Yet there would be no place for sentimentality in the midst of this battle, as Pyg unleashed another barrage of attacks on Gloria&#39;s fast dissolving familiar.

Rather all be damned to give absolution to those who didn&#39;t deserve it. 

It was when she saw the eyes of the beast that all this came into her mind. That didn&#39;t change much, Gloria still find it existence horrendous and almost an insult to life itself. Yet at she saw it face words came that she couldn&#39;t stop.

&quot;You are just a child&quot; 

She wanted to reach for Pyg face, but there was no chance as one again was blown away by the beast attacks. 

<em>Crack crack</em>

More pieces of Supay began to fell down and shatter like glass. Her vision had become blurry, it wasn&#39;t a surprise she had been bleeding so much that she was surprised she still had any blood left inside of her body. 

<em>crack crack</em>

More blows came, each one making the  image Gloria had fade inside of her mind. But even she tried again se fight back.

<em>crack crack</em>

She used all she had left to try and fight but it was a futile effort more and more cracks and pieces felt as she Supay&#39;s fist aimed to burn Pyg. After their exchange Supay has lost 2 of its arms and most of its body was gone, Pyg could easily avoid the avatar defenses and straight up hit her. But maybe that was what Gloria wanted?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138997745311555676 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138997745311555676><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 7:50 PM">7:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Through their exchange she heard someone speaking to her, one couldn&#39;t blame her for taking long to answer she was barely aware of what was happening around her besides of the giant meast monster in front of her.

She knew it was futile to lie to him so she didn&#39;t he just told him to worry about himself first.

The once potent flames that had danced around her had dimmed to a flicker. As absurd as the notion was, Pyg had managed to tame something as ethereal as fire, and fractured it down to its core. The acrid smell of burning flesh permeated the air; if one didn&#39;t know any better, they might have thought some kind of cook-off was happening right in the middle of the street.

And it <em>was</em> happening, in a sense. 

Hot blood spurted from Pyg&#39;s knuckles, both of their fists worn down to the point where scorched skin gave way to raw flesh, which sizzled, charred, and gave way to ashen bones. And what hideous structure they were, like the gnarly roots of withered trees, intertwined and stacked on top of one another to strength Pyg&#39;s body beyond what was humanly capable.

<em><strong>RRRRIP!</strong></em>

Three arms. Then down to two. Supay&#39;s form was disintegrating, and death was near. Pyg could almost taste it on their tongue. They almost squealed in excitement, as their collective minds diligently counted down the number of Supay&#39;s limbs like the countdown of a clock. The diminutive figure of the flame shaman, as fragile and as delicate as a flower that they could simply snuff her out, crush her between their fingers...They were so close, so <em>so</em> close...

Pyg knotted his hands together and brought them down with a crushing force onto Supay&#39;s remaining arms.

<em>Would their master praise them for a job well done?</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139285891060355203 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139285891060355203><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 10, 2023 2:55 PM">2:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Or the full  responsibility lies on the parents and the environment. For Gloria neither answer seemed to be fully correct, she knew better than anyone than absolutes don&#39;t exit, there isn&#39;t a single cause for anything.  Both the parent, the enviroment and the child itself had a responsibility they had a choice and a say in the matter. 

Yet if what was in front of him was truly human or at least it used to be, if it still had a soul even if it was an amalgamation of many then it may be an exception to what she believed. 

The arms put a defense but it wasn&#39;t enough, at impact the arms shattered and before Gloria could even try to use her coat as a shield she was smashed into the ground. A loud splash could be heard, same as if one were to squash a cockroach. Her left side had been smashed, she couldn&#39;t look at the damage but due to the lack of feeling she wouldn&#39;t be surprised if her arm and leg had turned into mush. 

<em>cough</em> More blood escaped her mouth. If she wasn&#39;t on the verge of death before she definately was now. Only a miracle would let her survive and she knew better than wait for those. Miracles don&#39;t come out of nowhere 

&lt;Takeru uh?&gt; yet she didn&#39;t seem that concerned about it. Sure she had lots of regrets and she wished it didn&#39;t had to come to this but crying and begging wouldn&#39;t change anything.  &lt;that&#39;s  good name, doesn&#39;t fit someone with such a cute face though&gt;

If so, he would had noticed, that while Supay had been almost completely destroyed its fragments still laid on the ground. The ruby pieces hadn&#39;t dissapeared and instead they began to shine brightly. 

This was Gloria last resort, her strongest image had been shattered but didn&#39;t meant that was all she had. She was used to being broken to be powerless and weak, she hated that side of her but she also knew that was something she couldn&#39;t get off. 

The Ignis magecraft worked in a very intiutive but simple way, flames had no shape so they can take any shape they want. While there were limits to the power and range of the flames in essence the Ignis magecraft was only limited by its user imagination and how they choose to use them. 

The beast didn&#39;t saw it coming but even if it did there was no way it could react in time, whatever remained of Supay and all its fragments suddenly changed into multiple chains. They coiled around it and burned the skin holding it tightly. 

The beast would try and break them but would see them being harder than anything it had encounter before. Like a flame about be snuffed it was it last shine, but their last shine was the brightest. 

&quot;Its not your fault&quot; The chains wouldn&#39;t hold Pyg long but Gloria didn&#39;t need long. &quot;Its not your fault that your creator was twisted, that your master didn&#39;t saw you as more than a weapon, that no one else tried to reach and taught you better.&quot;

The chains began to burn, the flesh of Pyg began to turn black as the chains began to pierce the skin sinking deeper making it harder for the puppet to break them. 

&quot;If you are what I think I hope you can be reborn better if not...&quot; she smile and put a hand on the fiery flesh. &quot;...Guess we can be in hell together&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139462782383833188 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139462782383833188><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 2:38 AM">2:38 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>As she said that the chains exploded, flames covered everything in a crimsom inferno, all was covered and consumed into a scarlet pillar of flames.

As her flesh began to turn into ash Gloria mind found some resemblance of peace. She had failed, there was no denying it but she wanted to believe that at the very least she had deal with some threat that would come for her child. 

<strong>I wish I could hold you one more time</strong>

<strong>I wish I could be with you when your life gets harder</strong>

<strong>Grow strong Allen, find a good wife, have lots of kids and live a happy life</strong>

Those were the the last thoughs of Gloria Ignis before her whole body dissapeared into ashes. Whatever happened to puppet? She had no way of knowing but she hoped it had found some well deserved peace.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once upon a time, they had another name. Multiple names, a different one for each individual that made up the entirety of Pyg. They led their own independent lives, unremarkable in the grand scope of history, perhaps, but nevertheless, they lived.

Then they were stuffed into a box, and made into something worse than dead.

Identities stripped, minds broken, bodies reforged. Gold exchanged hands as they were subjected to the agony of whips, the sting of blades, the scorch of fire and the shock of electricity. Again and again they were punished, with no permission to rest, no freedom to think. Bound and trapped within the confines of this box named &#39;Pygmalion&#39;, made to perform, to fight, a mere plaything in the hands of those who arrogantly called themselves &#39;puppet masters&#39;...

Resentment morphed into a frenzied rage, but over time, even the rage petered out into madness, and the memories eroded, giving way to a constant haze that dulled their minds.

They learned to find solace in the simplest things. The touch of their master&#39;s approval, the times they were fed and cleansed. These simple pleasures became their sole reason for existence. Even now, as chains of fire coiled around their frame and threatened to crush their bones, as searing pain engulfed their body and erupted into blinding flashes and orange and white, the creature called Pyg persisted.

Do this job right, and they would be praised by their master.

Praise. A fleeting, meager comfort. A most wonderful elixir, potent enough to quell their disquieted minds. But why were they seeking it in the first place? 

Pyg did not understand. But they did not question it further, as disobedience had been stamped out of them a long time ago. Only a single challenge presented itself before them: that of squashing the little human before them.

Heated air seared their lungs, but it only made them more agitated as they belted out a primal roar. Chains rattled against their body as they struggled to break them. They had grown restless. Perhaps, due to the prospect of almost snuffing out the human&#39;s life?

Pyg stared down with their beady eyes, clouded orbs fixated upon the woman sprawled on the ground and almost crushed under their barrage. How small she seemed, how frail her frame was. And yet, there was a spark in her eyes as she glared back at the colossal puppet, a look that stirred something within them. It was not rage that the woman held in her eyes, but a sentiment they could not fully fathom...

<em>Why are you looking at me like that stop staring at me with those eyes—</em>

...pity.

Comprehension eluded Pyg once more. Gloria&#39;s expression puzzled them. The sensation intensified—a tightness in their chest, an unfamiliar ache that choked them up harder than the smoke-clogged air. As the flames consumed them, Pyg felt a tremor in their hearts. An excruciating, yet oddly warming sensation enveloped their being. Memories stirred, fragments of them, coalescing around their fractured minds, solidifying into something almost tangible. Faces. Voices. Places they had never been. Were all of them, <em>theirs</em>?

Yet as the flames licked their body and devoured them whole, Pyg&#39;s capacity for thought waned. Fleshed turned to soot, bones to ash; it was painful, but also warm, as if they were cradled within a mother&#39;s womb, waiting to be reborn...

All around them, the world burned bright.

Then, there was nothing.
