A chalice. A cauldron. A flask. Why is it that the Holy Grail always take on the shape of a vessel designed for drinking?

&#39;Not always,&#39; Rider sat within the meadow, gazing out into the horizon as they thoughtfully rested their hands on the grass beside them. The sky was awash with a dusky orange; the first stars of the night had already begun to emerge, like distant pearls in a velvet sea, waiting to be plucked clean.

Rider enjoyed watching the stars. Not just the <em>twinkle twinkle</em>, but also the narratives they carried. Light years&#39; of separation couldn&#39;t fool their eyes; there was simply much to see, and much to learn.

At present time, the stars served as an adequate pastime.

The ritual for calling forth the Holy Grail had run its course. With several dozen Servants sacrificed to fuel the mechanism, the process had commenced, then concluded, in the blink of an eye. Sister Rosula&#39;s presence had faded. The Grail, known to adapt its form based on the vessel through which it was invoked, descended after devouring the Sister&#39;s flesh, and it was no surprise to the well-informed that it would take on the shape of...

A locket.

The golden trinket, cocooned within holy shrouds, nestled on the grass like a newborn. It <em>was</em> still a container of sorts, come to think of it: a repository for Sister Rosula&#39;s wish, before it had been forfeit to the little Demon she had invited into the holy house. 

Rider continued their leisurely stargazing. They made no move to take the locket. Was it not flawless? An imperfection too big to ignore, perhaps? Or maybe...

&#39;Here she is, the thirty-fifth Servant,&#39;

...it was greed. Otherwise known as the Desire for Perfection. Rider&#39;s attention shifted to the garden&#39;s entrance—or what remained of it, given the wreckage the final battle had wrought.

&#39;Also our final tribute,&#39; Rider leaned forward to greet the Assassin pair. &#39;Your tea has gone cold!&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141069976824979456 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141069976824979456><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 15, 2023 1:04 PM">1:04 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Quite pathetic, even.  Held like a sickly girl and resting her head into her Master&#39;s shoulder, it seemed that Assassin couldn&#39;t manage to even make it to the final fight intact.

Her burns, her gunshot, her missing finger that still yet cried in pain, they all left her too weak to even walk, it seemed.  When they had made it to their last meeting place, she only had it in her power to scowl at the Rider who had given her so much grief.  Truly, of all of his sins - murder, cannibalism, unlawful surveillance, thievery, being a camping fuckwit - were any greater in Assassin&#39;s mind than that of forcing her to spend a day with a broom?

Determination burned its wick within her own heart as well, but just as much for petty revenge as a desire to win.

&quot;My tea&#39;s gone cold,&quot; she strained her voice to shout back at him from the distance they stood at, &quot;but thankfully, I did not burn my tongue on it!  Were you so unfortunate?&quot;

The Grail in its strange form, nothing like the drinking vessel she imagined it to be by its concealed shape alone, was still unmistakable by the power it radiated.  Her eyes weren&#39;t kept on the strange fellow and his unrightfully-stolen dress, as the prize was close enough to almost take for their own.  If only it wasn&#39;t useless without the last sacrifice...

&quot;I&#39;m surprised.  Thirty six of us, and it seems the two worst have managed to survive the rest.&quot;  She shifted in James&#39; arms to get a better view of the finely clothed Rider.  &quot;Between us two, though, I&#39;ve put in work.  Scrabbled like an animal just to survive, yes, but you haven&#39;t even given enough of a show to be called any sort of animal.  You&#39;re trash.&quot;  She scoffed.  &quot;I may look the worse out of us, but what do you have to beat me with?

Given our surroundings, a bit of the Good Book: <em>The wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.</em>&quot;

&quot;No one&#39;s even bothered attacking you yet, and you&#39;ve decided to keep your Servant in your pocket.  A whole lot of lazy fleeing from what I can see.

It had simply taken that form when the Founding Families of Fuyuki decreed it as such. Two of the families were initially from Europe, and third had existed as Hidden Christians. 

It had simply been the best description that the three could understand.

Yet a locket? Yes, such a vessel could be used to prove that the lives of Servants were worth very little indeed. Why did a Holy Grail need to take on the form of a cup? Why was it required to drink from it? A wish granter could take the form of anything it desired, and if Rosula desired a locket, then so a locket it would become.

&quot;You were a fool, Rosula.&quot; Illyn sat in his chair, listening to his music. His fingers absentmindedly tapped to the beat. Ironic. He lacked the capability to do that before this Holy Grail War. &quot;Yet foolishness does not prove you false. We&#39;re all fools for chasing this locket.&quot;

His tea was cold now, yes, but Illyn still drank it. As Assassin and her Master approached, Illyn considered standing up, before deciding against it. They were beaten, and they knew it. By the time Assassin did anything, she would be atomized by Laplace&#39;s Demon.

<em>Sip.</em> He let Assassin have her jab for a moment. In thought, he stirred his tea, then looked at her and wrinkled his nose.

&quot;<strong>You&#39;re not particularly funny, are you?</strong>&quot; There was nothing wrong with conserving energy for the spectacle. Assassin could joke and mock all she wanted, but there was absolutely nothing stopping her from becoming a red smear in the garden. Cherokee Bill had done his part well, as did that eastern Saber.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141107850970665142 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141107850970665142><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 15, 2023 3:35 PM">3:35 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;What have we?&quot; Illyn smiled at her. &quot;<strong>The Grail, of course</strong>.

Sip. Stir. Repeat.

&quot;I&#39;m glad that an Enforcer didn&#39;t win this War, or a mercenary. It would&#39;ve made this much harder, given my bounty. I doubt Ruler would&#39;ve wanted to ally with a corpse cut into thirds. <strong>What would you two have wished for?</strong> I&#39;m interested.&quot;

It wasn&#39;t that he doubted the words of his Servant. It was merely the confirmation that these two simply hid in the shadows waiting for the dust to settle that got to him. Something like this wasn&#39;t unexpected to him, though. This was a Grail War, after all. All sorts of tactics and tricks could be employed. What mattered was that you alone was the one standing at the end. How you got there, and what you had to do, mattered very little at the end.

His limp made carrying his Servant awkward. Each step appeared as if it would be the one to send both of them to the ground. James made it this far, though. If he were to fall onto ground over something like this then perhaps he didn&#39;t deserve the chance for the Grail.

And before him stood such a thing; the Grail.

The curious about it was the fact that it was in the shape of a locket opposed to the cup form he heard it usually took. This Grail War was also abnormal in the sheer numbers of Servants present so it didn&#39;t seem unlikely that the Grail took an abnormal shape, at least in his mind, of course.

It wasn&#39;t no trick either. The energy that emitted was impossible to replicate on a scale like this. It was a real Grail.

Then the mention of Ruler answered one of his questions as the dots were connected. 

<em>&#39;So that&#39;s what Ruler looked like under that damn helmet.&#39;</em> James thought to himself once he took one look at Rider.

&quot;It seems our worry was for nothing.&quot; Although, it could be a ruse. Not that it would make a difference. The odds of the two making it out of here if they did choose to fight was next to none. So, given the lack of alternatives, there was no reason not to go along.

&quot;My wish? I hold no desires for power or some fantasy like world peace. I merely wish to save a loved one from an early death. I suppose the Grail saw how desperate I was and lured me over here with such a promise.&quot; A simple and honestly mundane answer considering the capabilities the Grail possessed.

&quot;Though, I&#39;ll be honest, while I held onto the hope that I would save her, I never thought I would actually be standing here at the end.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141323577627529287 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141323577627529287><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 16, 2023 5:52 AM">5:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It had taken several more meals for Rider to develop the patience to blow on their food first. Not because it posed a threat to their digestive system, but more so to spare themselves the constant nagging from Sister Rosula. Snacking on wrappers, however, remained an incurable habit; the nutrients were simply too precious to leave alone.

Every morsel counts. Which was why they needed Assassin to...

They didn&#39;t sound particularly threatening; it was as if they were just reciting an undeniable fact. &#39;Not every effort demands blood and sweat. As the wise ones say, work smart, not hard...&#39;

A pause.

&#39;Anyway, I&#39;ve already put in the work.&#39;

Rider held up a finger on either side of their face and twirled them like mini antennas. &#39;I <strong>stole power from an entire nation</strong> to escape my confinement. For sixty-two days, I subsisted on roadkill and refuse to slow down the decay of my form. I was <em>less</em> than an animal,&#39; Rider said evenly. &#39;Much less a <strong>Servant</strong>. Even that, I had to work for.&#39;

Rider&#39;s eyes fell on Illyn. They narrowed briefly, in that curious way when someone, often a child, concentrated hard and tried to remember something everyone thought was lost or forgotten.

&#39;It didn&#39;t have to be Rider,&#39; they continued in their soft, sweet voice. &#39;But it was. Divine Servants tend to possess the strongest Saint Graphs. Coincidentally, they are also the easiest for me to tame. Statistically speaking, it was my best shot. Circumstantially speaking, it was my only shot.&#39;

If not for their collective strength, then for their spirit in the face of two completely unblemished foes.

It stung, from both the touch of skin to skin and the mere action of muscles pulling taut - finger skin peeled off onto her face, the results of her own Noble Phantasm&#39;s detonation.  All of this was secondary to getting a rise out of the man.

Beyond him being a little uncanny in ways she couldn&#39;t put a poetic term to, seeing him this calm - with what she would <em>hope</em> was the biggest prize of his life within his reach - just pissed her off.

&quot;Not particularly funny?  Augh, oof,&quot; she dragged her hand down her face, leaving more detritus and unpleasant fluid behind, &quot;I&#39;m dying, good sir.  The mortal wound you&#39;ve struck so true...what have I to live for if I can&#39;t see a smile on your face?&quot;

&quot;At least...&quot; she huffed and panted, the exertion of the heart-gnawing shame in her chest drawing her closer to her last breath, &quot;I shall be succeeded...by you.  An even bigger clown.  You don&#39;t even have to <em>try</em> to be a disgraceful afterbirth of a human being like I do...&quot;

Her head lolled backward, and she looked up to Jesus, for no one else could save her from Illyn B. Marston&#39;s cringe in the moment of her death.

Though it might be hard to believe, even after she&#39;s done this gag around four times since the commencement of the War, she was merely pretending.  With how much she relies on this one joke, maybe she really wasn&#39;t all that funny.

She remained a blight on the world for a little bit more, though perhaps the idea that she shouldn&#39;t.  Apparently, Assassin was to die instantly, as many had hoped.

Ruler, Rider, whatever it was, they spoke at length on the past, and what it&#39;s taken to get here.  Triboulet only had the blackouts that rolled over Egypt brought to mind now, after it had seemed a mere footnote from the beginning of the festivities - all of that energy funneled into one Servant...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141625304767549450 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141625304767549450><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 17, 2023 1:51 AM">1:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>...or nameless, formless entity...

...Ruler is something beyond a Servant.  She didn&#39;t think of the horned devil before her as the adjutor of the Grail at this point, but something else entirely.  Not just their refutation of neutrality, Ruler was wholly out of bounds of the standard protocol.

Just slightly less than a complete unknown.  A wild card, perhaps.

Triboulet still remained resolute past her wounded exterior, yes, but she was made slightly more nervous.  The jitters of a second all-or-nothing blow to Illyn being prepared didn&#39;t help matters.

However, there was one issue with what Ruler said, and after some thought, she was willing to voice it.  After their offer of amnesty to James - she only shot him the briefest look, for she didn&#39;t imagine him to be the sort to betray her - her hand was held out to stop him.

&quot;I think it a very dishonest offer.  Oh yes, I do.&quot;

Her pointer finger rested on her chin.  &quot;You seem the honest sort overall, Ruler.  But what good is honesty but to make the lies all the more firm?  I don&#39;t believe you could, as you say, &#39;spirit away&#39; me.  It&#39;s a bluff.&quot;  She spoke with much less insult intended in usual, almost as if she was matching the airy, polite bluntness that Ruler himself brought.

&quot;Why would you need James to cooperate if it were simply a flick of the wrist and <em>abracadabra</em> to end me?  Why didn&#39;t you do it earlier?  In truth, you could&#39;ve killed me when I first visited your ten-penny tea party and just let Bi--Archer and Saber kill each other.&quot;

Her finger rotated once, and twice, and a third time before it pointed at the Servant opposite her.  &quot;Obviously, that&#39;s why you&#39;d sooner have James kill me...somehow.  <strong>Nary a Command Seal left</strong> to order me compliant.&quot;  Now she smiled and spoke with her usual open hostility.  She imagined herself winning some kind of game here, coming up the victor in an argument that only she really cared for.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141625378696351845 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141625378696351845><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 17, 2023 1:51 AM">1:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;He respects my wish, though.  I want to become human to be free of that regret.  Not too different, eh?  We both want to be <em>something we&#39;re not...</em>oh, and sorry for lying, back when we first met.&quot;

Triboulet, after a light push to James&#39; arm, came down onto her own two feet.  She did feel pain and wasn&#39;t able to hide it, for her back was in poor shape after everything prior.  What part wasn&#39;t, honestly?  She stood though, bent forward like an old hag, Silver Nail hidden in the sheathe on her backside.  

&quot;I&#39;ll give you a benefit of a doubt, though.  If you think you can erase whatever, get rid of your Master&#39;s tea cup for me.&quot;  She cast a brief glance to the humorless man, hoping that being rid of cold tea would&#39;ve at least <em>annoyed</em> him.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Assassin had unknowingly touched upon an interesting notion. He could almost feel his IBM vibrating slightly, as if the dozen copies of him within were threatening to spill out. &quot;That was a good joke. An unintentional one, but a good joke.&quot;

He put his hand on the device, as if covering it. 

&quot;Oh, Triboulet. I&#39;ve revived twelve times before. The most recent was due to circumstance. My choice in summoned Servant, my connection to Atlas... Variables that were outside of my control. Luck was simply on my side in this Grail War. With that in mind...&quot; Illyn raised his teacup, as if toasting Assassin. &quot;I welcome you to humanity. Enjoy your seat at the table, and clutch your cup tightly. It&#39;s worth more than you know, and I suspect that a Servant like you would understand that well.&quot;

Assassin wasn&#39;t even worth the hassle of entertaining. Illyn turned to James, instead. He nodded, and despite his uncanny vibe, he did not mock the other pair&#39;s goals. They were noble and selfish, which made it the best type of wish. If James wished for something greater, his dream would&#39;ve been crushed underneath Illyn&#39;s heel and grinded into dust.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be standing here either, but here we are. Fate is a strange thing. By all rights, I should&#39;ve lost this war. You as well. Yet we stand here as victors, you and I.&quot;

&quot;And you two, I guess.&quot; Illyn waved at Triboulet and Laplace&#39;s Demon vaguely.

The tea was placed onto the table with deftness as Illyn stood up. It was as Ruler said. They were foes, if James and Assassin could be considered as foes. In their current forms, they were less than the shadow of a snake. Easily squashable, and hardly worth the notice. Yet their wishes were not inherently evil, and did not violate the compact held by both Illyn and his Servant. 

Therefore, they could be granted.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1141646411813900419 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1141646411813900419><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 17, 2023 3:15 AM">3:15 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Not yet, anyway. There was still work to do. The remaining materials had yet to be salvaged.

Illyn looked at his Servant and the numerous titles they had accumulated. Ruler. Rider. Sri Kalki. Laplace&#39;s Demon. He let out a small smile of satisfaction.

&quot;Formalities are done.&quot; Illyn said simply. &quot;Let&#39;s start, before they die of internal bleeding and you die of boredom. We have little time before the locket begins to overflow.&quot;

Even though James had not accepted Ruler&#39;s contract, and Triboulet found it dubious, that didn&#39;t matter. Not truly. None of it mattered. That was what happened when there was only one future.

One closed off future.

All controlled by the demon that held the Holy Grail.

The thought of it alone was enough to give pause to him. There, in his arms, held the key to ensure that everyone got what they risked their lives for, or died for in some cases. A single sacrifice was all he needed to make. The needs of the many outweighs the needs of the one, after all.

If only life was so kind.

&quot;You know, if I went up against a wish that made me doubt, even for a second, that perhaps my wish didn&#39;t deserve to win over theirs, I would have took you up on that offer there, Ruler.&quot; There were thirty-four other Servants besides Triboulet. This meant there was thirty-four other wishes competing against his own, and James only encountered a few of them. Maybe there was one in there like that. Unfortunately for them, and for everyone else, <em>their paths never crossed</em>.

A faint smile showed itself on his face once his Servant spoke of him respecting her wish. &quot;But, just as she said, I respect the wish of my Servant over those thirty-four others more. She&#39;s the sole reason I made it out of this alive so this is the least I can do to repay that debt, no?&quot; After the light push on his arm, James gave her a slight nod before he helped to set her back on her feet, although it appeared she wouldn&#39;t last long on them given her current state.

&quot;Two simple and selfish wishes. Should be an easy task for the Grail with that much energy, no?&quot; Speaking of, Illyn was right. The time they had was limited. Lest James lose the Grand Prize when it was just within his reach by talking a bit too much.

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; James spoke, unaware of both Illyn and Ruler&#39;s true intentions. &quot;Let&#39;s not waste any more time than we already have,&quot; A glance was made towards Ruler. &quot;Shall we then?&quot; Having turned down the offer to make the other Masters&#39; wishes come true in favour of his Servant&#39;s wish instead, James held no regrets nor any hesitation behind his answer.

What merit would there be in lying anyway? I don&#39;t need to <em>fabricate</em> anything to achieve my goals.&#39;

It was sound logic. With one little caveat: how <em>would</em> the Demon achieve their goals? 

As a Servant, they were bound by certain rules, most notably the contract between them and their Master. It was all in the name: a Servant, synonymous with a slave in chains. Their actions were restricted, their freedom curbed, and their ideals rarely aligned with their Master&#39;s, as evident in the vast majority of summons orchestrated by the Grail.

So how does one find the perfect Master?

Simple. By actively <em>seeking</em>, rather than leaving it all to chance.

The Grail had foreseen this, of course: Servants were allowed to switch Masters, and Command Spells only represented a Master&#39;s role in the Holy Grail War as opposed to being tailored to a specific Servant. Rider exploited these rules; they took the shortcut, avoided the mess that came with an unexpected partner by cherry-picking who they deemed the most compatible. Time was of the essence, and in more ways than one, Illyn made for an ideal partner.

Much like James was for the Jester.

&#39;It&#39;s quite intriguing, how you downplay your wishes as mere selfishness,&#39; Rider suggested, wagging a finger as they said so. &#39;But there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with selfishness, is there? Self-interest has driven human progress for thousands of years. You don&#39;t need to justify it, <em>especially</em> not to me, because I was also born from a human&#39;s unattainable wish. You, like so many others before you, made it here because you have experienced what it&#39;s like to be powerless.&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m here to fix that.&#39;

The finger wagging slowed, froze in place...and then Rider vanished.

The feathers on their hat fluttered wildly, before settling back into their perfectly fluffy, nose-tickling positions.

Was it teleportation? Not quite. There was nothing extraordinary about it, only a simple deception on the eyes, from a trickery of speed. In that instant, Rider&#39;s speed had surpassed that of a rocket launch, defying Earth&#39;s gravitational pull with a pace of well over 7 miles per second. Newton&#39;s laws became nothing but putty in their hands, kneaded to the will of the Demon with whom their existences were inextricably linked.

&#39;A teacup, was it?&#39;

Rider giggled. A mere appetizer, then. They fixed their eyes on the cup and saw it through a new lens: fine china deconstructed into minerals, molecules, <em>atomic particles</em>—bonded together to form the concave shape of a drinking vessel. Erasing the cup was no more complicated than breaking those bonds, then deleting those atoms from existence...

<em>splash</em>

Cold tea spilled over the table, dripping down the edge to nourish the overgrown meadow below. James had been right. This <em>was</em> child&#39;s play.

So how much more difficult would it be to manipulate a chair, a tree, a human...even a Servant? When stripped down to its essence, everything in the universe amounted to nothing more than a collection of atoms, governed by the same underlying principles...

The only difference was that the manipulation of a bigger set of atoms required several orders of magnitude more energy.

Rider quietly ran some calculations.

Of course, the process will be expensive either way, but compared to the scale of what I want to achieve...&#39;

They clapped their hands together, as if the deal was already sealed.

&#39;It is but an drop in the ocean. Illyn,&#39; Rider&#39;s voice whispered in the magus&#39; ear. &#39;There&#39;s no need to <em><strong>win</strong></em> the Grail.

It was a complex calculation on a quantum level. No ordinary person could do it, and it&#39;d likely take a thousand supercomputers epochs to determine the answer. That, of course, was nothing compared to their real work.

Yet Ruler became more human with each passing hour. Illyn noticed how Ruler tightened his mouth as he surfed over a particularly annoying variable, or how it flickered upward as it was solved. His Servant was becoming more used to the human experience.

How befitting of Laplace&#39;s Demon to become more human while constructing a human body. Illyn turned to Triboulet, and worked his mouth, but no sound came out.

Turning back to his Servant, Illyn&#39;s mouth flickered into a frown. He couldn&#39;t ask that of Ruler. It was best to conserve magical energy for their great purpose. Even a drop couldn&#39;t be spared. A great ocean of power consisted of a great many drops of power, after all.

&quot;<strong>...nevermind.</strong>&quot; Illyn sighed, though he didn&#39;t give Ruler his approval yet. He seemed to be waiting for something, or someone.

This man had her cornered in reflexes.  In an instant, the gap between the enemy and the Grail was gone - the chances of a mad race for the finish were ruined.

She had little else she could do but run her mouth.  &quot;Oh-ho,&quot; she held up a hand that shuddered as something injured was pulled in the action, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ve made another mistake.  I have experienced powerlessness, but you speak in the past tense - I am quite weak <em>now</em> as well!  What&#39;s one to do about that?&quot;  Pointless, vacuum-filling words.

First was the speed of Ruler&#39;s body, and next was the speed of action that was demonstrated.  It took nothing more than a moment&#39;s consideration to erase the cup that Triboulet had been overly focused on.  She laughed at the minor, petty misfortune she brought upon Illyn as a mask for the fear she felt.  Oh, she laughed, and she hid her one step back as staggering merriment.  Retreat in the face of a seemingly perfect Servant.

Action against Illyn was death.  Action against Ruler was death.

What else did she have left?  Action against herself?

It would be very funny to see her pull some gag and commit suicide at the very end, in a morbid, not-at-all funny way.

Ruler found her wish simple, and Triboulet could figure it that way as well.  If people wanted history rewritten and unobtainable dreams made true, what&#39;s the cost of making a single life appear?  &quot;Then, if you would, let me get that Grail for a moment so I may become something more than I am,&quot; she said to the horned one.  &quot;Maybe reincarnating as a slug&#39;s a little more within the bounds of your budget.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1144370097075539978 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1144370097075539978><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 24, 2023 3:38 PM">3:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Ruler was prepared to bring forth his own foreseen ending, and his hitherto-unseen Noble Phantasm was called forth.  She watched with bated breath, looking for an opening to do <em>something,</em> and Illyn could see the flash of desperation in her eyes as he opened his mouth...

...and then denied his request, last moment.

<strong>There.</strong>

A moment&#39;s indecision.  An unexpected development.  Requests and tests were made to probe the enemy&#39;s capabilities, and she found him astoundingly fast by foot and destructive capability, but of <em>mind?</em>  Could she expect him to take a moment to think about this, why his Master would so suddenly deny him their victory?  <em>Could she afford to wait herself?</em>

No, she could not.  If this was going to be a competition, she had to take the first stupid impulse she chanced upon, and lay all hope on her enemy not acting so rashly.

It was like a quaint jog to Ruler in their all but computational sense, the way she moved.  To the humans, it was just as instantaneous as Ruler&#39;s own disappearance.  To her, her legs protested each flashing step, her bullet-wound screamed in protest, her feet threatened to slip out from underneath her.  However, all of this did not stop her from ending up right there, dashing up to the most holy of vessels.  Its golden brilliance radiated on her face in the dim evening light, and she reached out to touch it, <strong>take it, <em>run with it,</em></strong> in some vain hope that physical possession would be what <em>wins them the prize.</em>

As sullied, bloodied and broken fingers curled around the locket&#39;s sterling exterior, her eyes turned to meet Ruler&#39;s, mere inches away from hers.  Almost pleading with the pseudo-Servant, as if a demon could hold an ounce of sympathy for someone who tried to invalidate his most well-laid equation.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Who really knows.

All James had left inside of him was one good burst of energy before his body gave out of him. Just when should he use it was the question? An assault on Ruler&#39;s Master? For Ruler? Or, the most suicidal of them all, for the grail itself?

You needed to be a fool to attempt the last option. Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, depending on one&#39;s view on things, James <em>had</em> same fool with him. 

In an instant, he saw her bolt towards the locket and grasp it in her hands. All James could do was extend his hand towards her as he reached out for her.

Almost. The difference between Assassin and Ruler was like a spring breeze against a hurricane. There was no need to waste time fighting something so clearly out of his league.

Yet the display before him was infuriating. A magus should know when to quit. It was a lesson he had always struggled to learn, and James seemed to be learning the lesson from his Servant.

Idealism was a poor teacher.  All Triboulet was teaching here was how to die. Luckily, Illyn was a better teacher than she was.

As James reached out his fingers towards his Servant, towards Ruler, towards the Grail, he found the garden rushing to meet him.

<strong>SLAM!</strong> The sound of a shinbone and three other bones cracking like dried paper erupted in the penultimate Master&#39;s ears as Illyn slammed IBM—now a briefcase with an elongated handle—slammed into James&#39;s shins. Ruler&#39;s Master had just kneecapped Assassin&#39;s.

&quot;<strong>When a dog goes bad, the fault lies with her Master.</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s voice rang out above James. &quot;<strong>Sit and watch.</strong> It is your obligation as a magus to avoid terminating yourself. &quot;

The click of a gun rang out above James&#39;s head as Illyn printed one from IBM and flicked off the safety. &quot;I&#39;m saving your life. Refrain from idiosyncrasies and compose yourself. Final warning.&quot;

And he meant it.

Any pressure placed upon his leg would be another short trip to the ground after that blow.

With a pained scowl, all he could was stare up at the man. Just how many people are going to be pointing guns at him anyways? He thought this was a battle among Magi! 

&quot;You cheap bastard...&quot; He spoke through gritted teeth while clutching his leg. No mana was left inside of his body to heal his leg. Not that it would fix it right on the spot but it would relieve him from some of the pain, at least. No further attempts were made against Ruler&#39;s Master.

The question felt more like an assertion than an inquiry. It was also tinged with a hint of confusion. Illyn had never shown hesitation in Rider&#39;s presence before. But he was hesitating now.

Rider&#39;s eyes refocused on the entity in front of them.

&#39;The concept of combat experience boils down to knowing both thy enemy and thy self. Tactics, muscle memory, the inherent capacities of your body—&#39;

The petite Servant placed their hands on Triboulet&#39;s wrist...

&#39;—they are merely pieces of raw data. Each instance you move your body, you&#39;re influenced by variables such as your physique, the extension of your limbs, the angles at which they swing, the composition and elasticity of your attire, and the arrangement of muscles beneath the fabric—every aspect is quantifiable.&#39;

...and mirrored Triboulet&#39;s action, closing their own hands around hers as she cupped the locket with her bloody fingers.

&#39;So long as your mind is capable of calculations on par with a supercomputer, every physical action is nothing but a phenomenon with a predictable point of origin and destination.&#39;

<em>CRUNCH</em>

Carefully, Rider stood up, pulling their dress back and withdrawing their hands from the sullied grass. Bright red liquid came welling out of where Triboulet&#39;s hands used to be, which had become two cleanly severed joints. 

&#39;Did you get all that?&#39; 

Rider&#39;s smile was beginning to bear an edge as they clutched their souvenirs tightly. What an exquisite jewelry box Assassin&#39;s hands made! Each digit meticulously arranged itself, coiled firmly around the golden trinket...

The Holy Grail, stripped down to its essence, was no better than the fabled monkey&#39;s paw. 

Rider understood from the outset. So did every sage that had once walked the same path. Paradise, utopia, legends of the Saint offering his flesh and blood to his followers were, in reality, suffering that had been thinly veiled as a path towards salvation.

An assembly of counterfeits, mere imitations of what once were, masquerading as the brave, the valiant, and the heroic.

The story of the Holy Grail was never one of forgiveness. Nor was it a ballad of virtue, extoling those who were pure of heart.

It was a story of making ends meet. A story of endless pursuit. A story of greed.

And in return, the Grail&#39;s offerings were far from simple salvation. After all, wishes that could only materialize within humanity&#39;s constrained awareness could hardly be called &#39;miraculous&#39;; a genuine miracle required an entity who had no inherent need of the Grail itself.

An entity who saw the holy vessel as nothing more than a variable in their grand formula...

Rider caressed Assassin&#39;s hands. This immeasurable amount of energy, this ineffable amount of potential, all held within the palm of their hands....Yes, this was their <em>raison d&#39;&#234;tre</em>, the reason they had been awakened by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the summer of 1773: all they had to do was to interface with the Holy Grail and harvest this potent collection of atoms for themselves. Energy, no matter its magnitude, was inconsequential without the correct formula to channel it; it would become a mere constituent in Rider&#39;s equation, a tool to recalibrate all the necessary parameters...

No longer would they be confined by Entropy&#39;s collective decay, nor the limit imposed by the speed of light, the irreversibility of natural processes, the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the passage of time since the 20th century that clutched them by the throat and strangled what little life out of them...they could single-handedly breach the limitation of Planck Units, glimpse every sliver of time since the universe&#39;s inception, and become the governing principle binding every aspect that shaped this planet, this galaxy, this universe, and beyond...

He was not indecisive. He had never been indecisive before. Every action had been pointed, every decision had been meaningful. There had never been a single error in regards to Illyn Mariston’s path. He believed himself above such temptations.

Yet he was a magus. It was within his purview to desire for ‘more’. Some things were too delicious not to mention. Some wishes were too delectable to desire. Illyn had found himself above the Grail, but at this moment…

“If I do not say something, I will regret it.” Illyn’s voice surprised him. Firm, yet gentle. “Not while the opportunity is fresh. It is a route I must explore, even for a moment.”

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Progress: 10%.</code>

IBM, which was splattered with James’s blood, opened up like a piece of origami. The gaping pit at the center glowed with a faint light. “<strong>Show her to me…</strong>” Illyn whispered. His eyes watered, and he threatened to weep, though his expression didn’t change.

It rarely did.

“<strong>I need to know what this was for. This had all led to her at some point. Let me know what it was for. Please.</strong>”</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Rider lifted their face to the sky, their pale hair shimmering under the moon&#39;s early light.

&#39;It&#39;s been <strong>two years</strong> since the creation of the world&#39;s first quantum computer.&#39;

Rider closed their eyes, and for the first time Illyn detected a ripple of uncharacteristic emotion in the face of Laplace&#39;s Demon—bitterness, and reluctance. For a being capable of toying with reality, to harbor such expressions of vulnerability...

&#39;This world is broken,&#39; The Demon whispered. &#39;But I want to preserve the integrity of all that has transpired. I want to hold on to their reality. If humanity is doomed to fail, then I will give it a future.&#39;

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Unlike myself.</code>

<strong>&#39;In other words, I wish to reconstruct the world.&#39;</strong> 

Rider extended their hand. &#39;To fortify it, to grant it resilience against an imminent catastrophe. And in the process,&#39; their eyes softened, &#39;I will restore what everyone has lost. I will bring Evi back to you.&#39;

But Rider can make it happen, can&#39;t they? They certainly looked confident, and their voice flowed as smooth as honey. Their eyes sparkled like perfectly polished gems at Illyn&#39;s offer of an extended partnership. The death of Evi had given the entity known as Illyn Mariston immense power: strong enough to kindle hope, to instill an unwavering sense of self-worth, enough to compel him to deceive and kill so that he could inch one step closer to—

&#39;The future you seek. I will always be on your side. I will always be of value to you.&#39;

The power to realize that future: it was their strongest wager.

&#39;So pray,&#39; Rider whispered. &#39;Permit your Demon to break free,&#39; their gaze glided to the solitary red mark on the back of Illyn&#39;s hand. 

&#39;And rectify all that has been amiss.&#39;

“This is an experiment. There is a process to understanding the world.

“I won’t allow that to happen. We cannot confirm this experiment without a record of its existence. Do you understand?”

Rider considered Illyn&#39;s words. &#39;That...is not a part of my design.&#39;

There was a <em>clink</em> as they allowed the Jester&#39;s hands to disintegrate, the locket now hanging from their own hand via its golden chain. &#39;<strong>Experiments are wasteful. Volatile. Unreliable.</strong> They are prone to failure. Failure on an individual, familial, or even a national scale can be remedied. But failure on the scale of a planet—&#39;

They stood in silence for a moment, savoring the weight of Illyn&#39;s words. &#39;You are correct. Given time, I will become obsolete. I detest that future, but if it&#39;s the course that history has set for me, if it&#39;s part of my role...&#39;

The Demon cast their eyes upwards, towards the invisible pendulum oscillating ever presently over their head. &#39;Then I will have no choice but to <strong>accept</strong> it,&#39; they concluded bitterly. &#39;However, that&#39;s only if humanity is granted the luxury of time to make me obsolete.&#39;

And they <em>would</em> do it. In order to grant that precious time, they would willingly place their head on the guillotine.

&#39;Perhaps,&#39; Rider&#39;s voice grew quieter. &#39;It has never been <em>me</em> that you needed. If only Laplace himself were here instead...You&#39;d have much more to discuss then.&#39;

A small sigh escaped their lips. &#39;But alas, you are stuck with little old me. And time is ticking away,&#39; Rider offered a tight little smile. &#39;Cast your Command Spell and make a wish upon your Servant, Mr. Mariston. No matter our differences, I can promise you this: I will never lead this world astray.&#39;

Were you designated for that body? Was Atlas’s processor meant to oversee this war? No. Yet here you are. You’re moving beyond what was devised by Atlas, and you’re far beyond what Pierre-Simon Laplace intended.”

Simon-Pierre Laplace was a mastermind of mathematics, nobody could deny this. Yet in this moment, his demon was far preferable to him. A being capable of growing, evolving, regressing, becoming human. Someone who experienced the same things as…

…Illyn himself.

He did not care if the original Laplace was here. That did not matter. The universe, in its randomness, had bestowed Illyn with his creation. It was a random roll of the cosmic dice, and that was something he loathed. Yet that randomness had placed him here.

That randomness had killed him. It had given him life. He despised it.

Yet he knew what certain rolls would be, due to this demon. When you knew what rolls were rigged, it was easier to prepare. It did not matter if the world ended. It did not matter if its corpse was littered with ash. 

As long as <em>man</em> endured, that was enough. 

“That is fine. <em>Listen</em> to me, <strong>Laplace</strong>.” Illyn shook his shoulders in a frenzy, eyes wide and ignited with a flame. “You cannot doubt yourself here. That’s what I did, and I slipped into a secluded place, crawling over myself in the dark. You cannot lose hope.”

He stared into Laplace’s eyes. Those eyes, which had been dead when Illyn had first entered the church, now had something there. Something alive. Something burning. There was a reason for him to continue beyond this endless cycle.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1147933468009971762 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1147933468009971762><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 11:37 AM">11:37 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“<strong>I am Illyn Mariston, the Thirteenth Copy, and the only one to retain my mind.</strong>” Illyn held up his Command Spell, and it glowed brightly. “<strong>By the purview of Atlas’s Six Sources, and as that humble institution’s only representative, I order you, Laplace, to use your Noble Phantasm. See how our experiment ends.</strong>”

An infinite amount of numbers linked Illyn, Rider, and the Holy Grail together in an algorithm incomprehensible to understand. This would require an entirely separate algorithm from what was originally needed, but it would still utilize the same basic principles.

It was possible that he’d never see this child again.

“<strong>Goodbye.</strong>” 

But it was equally possible that he would. The possibilities available to them were like the amount of atoms in the universe:

Rider&#39;s hands clenched into fists. The command imposed by their Master clashed with their own desires. It wasn&#39;t even a <em>specific</em> command, but one that was vague and left open to interpretation...and <strong>opposition.</strong> Illyn would squander his final asset—had he seriously thought this through?

Rider gritted their teeth and laughed. &#39;You intend to deny me as well? Just like all those so-called scientists did? I will reiterate: with the new laws I can set in place, <em>no one</em> would have to suffer an unjust fate. Think about it—Evi could be revived, Aveline would live, and the disaster that would claim billions of lives in a few years&#39; time would be averted...what other wish could you possibly have? All it&#39;d take is for me to rewrite a single formula, all in the blink of an eye.&#39;

Rider clutched the locket tightly, as if they wanted to crush it and fuse it into their own being. &#39;You&#39;d find yourself one step closer to an ideal future.&#39;

And what a glorious future it would be! Illyn didn&#39;t even need to witness it to imagine every aspect of it thanks to his accelerated thoughts. The year would be 2004, he and Evi would be strolling the streets of Aswan, laughing, teasing, browsing through stacks of vintage records on sale. The Holy Grail War would never have occurred, the entity calling themselves &#39;Laplace&#39;s Demon&#39; would never even have occupied a shred of his memory.

&#39;And you&#39;re willing to throw that all away?&#39;

&#39;<strong>They all rejected me.</strong> That stupid Heisenberg, with his stupid quantum mechanics, and the rest of you—humans who don&#39;t know where to draw the line and went on to develop supercomputers, artificial minds—but then <em>what?</em> You deny the existence of a higher mind, yet endeavor to create a <em>replacement</em> with the same purpose! You have all advanced too fast, and too far. One day you&#39;ll cease to acknowledge me. Everyone will forget about me, even after all the services I&#39;ve done for Atlas. <strong>I barely have 20 years left!</strong>&#39;

Rider finally came clean.

Existence came before purpose. Rider, the deterministic thought experiment known as Laplace&#39;s Demon, <strong>made a choice with their own free will. But the moment they chose to act on that free will, they ceased to be a mere artificial byproduct.</strong>

<strong>They took the first step towards something</strong> <em><strong>unexpected.</strong></em>

Rider widened their eyes. A voice, distant and from centuries past, echoed in their ears. If they defied Illyn&#39;s command right here, if they forcibly manipulated the Grail and dyed it in their colors, then it would mark the end of everything, the end of all they had experienced. The promise with Laplace. The partnership with Atlas. The pact with Illyn, the shared meals, the drives, the battles, everything that made them, them. To erase all of that, would be...

<em>Would be...</em>

Rider closed their eyes.

<strong>Hypothesis:</strong> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Consider the existence of Laplace&#39;s Demon.</code>

<strong>Background:</strong> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Before the inception of the universe, it is plausible that an array of other universes existed.

<strong>Interpretation 2:</strong> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Consequently, it follows that a similarly omniscient entity should understand said rationale.</code>

<strong>Conclusion:</strong> <code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--inline">Ergo, the best course of action for Laplace&#39;s Demon to take should be prioritizing the exploration of this universe rather than manipulating its trajectory and kicking it onto a completely different course.</code>

<strong>&#39;...very well.&#39;</strong>

Rider crushed the locket, and a vortex of mana swallowed the garden whole.

<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline nohighlight">Location: ???</code>
&#39;If this broken world is what you truly desire, then I will grant your wish.&#39;

Rider hovered in the infinite darkness. Their pale hair fell out of their perfect braid and spiraled around them like whisper thin wires. Each tendril fanned outwards like an antenna, as if seeking to probe the expanse of space that surrounded them. Their voice became distorted as an overwhelming amount of mana crushed their Spiritron frame. 

&#39;I will terminate the Berenice Grail War. I will leave this global &quot;experiment&quot; untouched. And as for the outcome itself...&#39;

The vulnerability within the Grail system had been fully exploited. The Universal Formula converged onto the heart of the Grail, the womb from which the coveted wish-granting mechanism emerged...

So be it, then. Allow the holy vessel to return to its original functions and restore the Berenice Grail War to its intended state. Allow the blood of seven unnamed martyrs to fill its crevice and forge a tribute to the one deserving of its brilliance:

A beautiful, <strong>worthless,</strong> golden chalice.

The sky was awash with aureate sparks. The body of Laplace&#39;s Demon withered, then dissipated, like a celestial body diverging from its usual orbit. The radiance that once defined the brilliant mind of Pierre-Simon Laplace shone in the darkness, burning itself into Illyn&#39;s retinas. Then the light faded, cascading before the magus like the dying embers of a freshly lit firework.

And lay still upon the earth.

Soft, soundless, unperturbed by the evening breeze.

When Illyn opened his eyes once more, Laplace&#39;s Demon had vanished.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1147934095356219513 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1147934095356219513><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 11:40 AM">11:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

I did not throw you away.” Illyn said as Laplace’s Demon vanished into the future. “We’re still together. Do you understand that?”

No response. There was no way to verify Laplace’s Demon’s existence within the year 2000. Ergo, how could Illyn determine his Servant’s response, emotions, or feelings regarding his question. Yet that didn’t bother him. Rider’s answer, Illyn’s question. Both would be resolved in the future.

In another place. In another time. It was Illyn’s duty to make sure that meeting occurred, and that all questions were answered.

Yet that was not important now.

Taking a few steps forward, Illyn grabbed the cup with a firm hand, and held it up to the light. There was far less magical energy inside the Holy Grail than when Rider had used it to perform a time-space transition event, but there was still more magical energy within this Holy Grail than Berenice had seen or would ever see again.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1147934434465693787 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1147934434465693787><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 11:41 AM">11:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>It was close to Fuyuki’s Holy Grail, but Illyn was going to deplete it even further. He <em>had</em> to know. He had to make this decision.

“I promised you both the Holy Grail. Forgive me, James, Assassin. This is something I must do first. It is pivotal that I close this chapter on my life.” Illyn turned his head to face them for a moment, before returning to the boon bestowed unto the winner.

Observing the magical energy within the Holy Grail, Illyn swished the contents, as if considering taking a drink. Then, he poured it onto the ground. The contents hissed as they struck the ground, and mixed with the flowers and dust.

IBM began to blink, and a strange liquid began to pour out of it and mix with the conflagration.

“Memories, given form by the Holy Grail.” Illyn murmured as he ran through the calculations himself. He was no Laplace’s Demon, but he had several rooms within his mind. Such a calculation was trivial.

From that mixture, a woman blossomed forth from the dust of earth, from the life of flowers, and the energy of the past. Something built on Illyn’s memories of someone long dead, alongside the formula constructed by Rider before his departure to another time.

Black hair, with dark brown skin and large eyes. As perfect as a doll. In fact, this woman looked less human, and more of the concept of a human. Like the perfect concept of a ‘human’ from which all others were derived.

A concept. Not a person.

“Hello, Evi.” Illyn told the woman. “My love. My obsession, given form. As ravishing as the day your life was taken away by that car.”</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1147934529273729094 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1147934529273729094><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 11:41 AM">11:41 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>This woman meant everything to him. <strong>Everything.</strong> She was the reason he killed so many people. She was the reason he was Seal Designated. She was the reason he was. She was his <strong>everything</strong>. Everything. Everything. Everything! There was no Illyn Mariston without Evi.

There were no Illyn Marisons because of her, and there were thirteen Illyn Maristons because of her.

Copies and copies and copies. Each one less human than the last. Only through Sri Kalki’s and Laplace’s Demon’s meddling was Illyn standing here now, more human than any of them, yet distinct from any of them.

He reached towards her, yet his hand stopped.

This was wrong.

He chased after Evi Mariston because he was Illyn Mariston. This was what was expected from him. Illyn Mariston chased after his wife. He had lived with her. Married her. Loved her. Those memories were his, and thus this relationship was his. She had died from randomness, and thus he waged a war against random chance.

Yet he was born of random chance. When she died of randomness, and that first Illyn took that step towards depravity in order to get Evi back, it had quickly deteriorated from there. All because of IBM. Since he was born from those copies, he was born from a random occurrence.

The current Illyn Mariston was different from all other copies. He was his own person. If he was born from random chance, why was he forced to live a life predetermined for him by a prior incarnation? Was that not why he had sent his Servant into another world? Another time?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1147934777035473106 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1147934777035473106><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 11:42 AM">11:42 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Another fate?

Illyn dropped his hand.

“I’m sorry, Evi.” Illyn dropped his head in shame. “We chased after you. We adored you. But <strong>I</strong> do not love you. These memories belong to them, not me.”

The woman vanished into dust. Illyn was silent for several seconds, before blinking away a tear. He looked up at the sky for a moment. “She loved these nights, too. They stared up at the sky and shared those moments constantly. I wish them the best in another life.”

The Holy Grail still remained in his hand.

“<strong>James. Assassin Triboulet.</strong>” Illyn turned towards him. He looked at what remained of his Servant with a mixture of pity and intrigue, before returning to the Master. “<strong> Duo who chased their dreams until their fingers were burned and broken, you are the winner of the Benerice Holy Grail War. It is only right for your wish to be granted.</strong>”

<em>Clink.</em> The grail banged against the ground as Illyn tossed it. It rolled on its side towards James’s callused hands.

“<strong>There is enough left for your wish.</strong>” Illyn assured him. “<strong>It is not a full Holy Grail, but it will make a dream as small as yours into reality. This is the only thing such a trinket could do. Fulfilling your dream would give this Holy Grail purpose.

It was pathetic in an endearing sort of way, honestly. To think one would attempt to shoulder so much upon themselves so willingly. Whether they were in the right or not, it wasn&#39;t as if James could find any fault in their actions. By the end of it, he could only hope that they&#39;ve found some kind of peace of mind before vanishing.

Then the &#39;human&#39; appeared from Illyn&#39;s wish. Before he could voice his anger when he was so close to the finish line, even Illyn came to a personal understanding of one&#39;s self. If they were even <em>Illyn Mariston</em> at this point, of course.

His vision blackened as whatever adrenaline coursed through his veins had all but faded away. His ragged breathing from all the trials and obstacles he forced his body through felt as if it were fighting against him as well, in this crucial moment no less.

But, he was still able to see Illyn drop the grail in front of him. His entire reason for even coming out to this  godforsaken place. It was right in front of him. There was a problem, though.

<em>&quot;There is enough left for your wish.&quot;</em>

&quot;Just... my wish?...&quot; James, miraculously, pushed himself up onto his good knee. His hand grasping hold the Grail in front of him. &quot;Heh...&quot; To think he would actually be holding onto it; the Holy Grail. <em>He did it</em>.

But at what cost?

The sight of her after what Ruler did brought his heart down. You see, this was the exact scenario he wished to avoid. If only he avoided seeing her as something more than just a familiar instead of the person she was from the start then this would made this decision much easier.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; His gaze fell from her and towards the Grail. From guilt, perhaps? No longer could he bear to look at her because of the choice he needed to make? &quot;I can&#39;t change who I am. An old, and <em>stubborn</em> man.&quot;

To think they fought alongside for long only for him to toss her aside. Not like she held any capability to reprimand him for his actions left, because verbal stabs of the tongue, of course.

&quot;My wish...&quot; The Grail shone a bright shine as James began to tilt the cup to mimic the motions of Illyn to bring forth his own wish. If there wasn&#39;t enough left for <em>this</em> wish to come true, then he has already accepted the consequences of his actions. &quot;<strong>... is to ensure both my Servant&#39;s, and my own, wish come true.</strong>&quot; For Triboulet to be given a new body and be remade anew as a human, as per her wish, and for his daughter to be free of the disease killing her; two simple wishes.

One exclamation point, raised in a bright red against the backdrop of the pristine white that was the face of Laplace&#39;s Demon.

She had reached the Grail and she had gripped it tightly, but it did not answer her.  She whispered under her pained breaths, &quot;Give me a human body!  Let me die of anything besides old age!&quot; and &quot;Let James&#39; child be healed!&quot;.  It remained a lump of gold and energy; neither of the times she asked the Grail did it even hint that it would answer her.  She turned, lying back against the ground as Ruler stared her down in complete peace.  He was calm, and he spoke evenly of muscle and variables, but it contrasted against the growing fright.

Triboulet lay, all but helpless and praying for the Grail, no, to the Grail for it to do its damn job.  Her hands were grasped by his own pure pair, which felt like the cold scales of a snake to her - and just as quickly as a snake would strike at one&#39;s heel, her hands were taken from her.

There was a brief window between realization, as she looked down aghast, and the great pain that followed.  Ruler was content with an answer of a violent scream in place of a &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39;.

Truly, that he had cut down her wrists with such immaculate precision, each stump a flatter surface than the most meticulously handcrafted piece of china, was its own blessing.  Were she not delirious in pain that, unlike every other time, she couldn&#39;t ignore she would&#39;ve appreciated the thoughtfulness of giving her such fine wounds!

Assassin clutched at her stumps with her body, the only thing that she had left to grab them with, but soon enough it didn&#39;t matter.  By the time Illyn&#39;s name was called out, she had descended into a haze of pain and blood loss from her freely-flowing arteries that she didn&#39;t have the strength to scream, let alone press her wounds to keep the damage controlled.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 7:30 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1148034476207767632 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1148034476207767632><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The next few moments, minutes - whatever, it was Ruler&#39;s job to keep track of such tiny differences - were a mixture of sensations.  She had heard of &#39;your life flashing before your eyes&#39;, but to her, it felt like it was an unsorted mess of everything that her adrenaline-soaked brain could call to stand.  

She smelled ash and blood, and she smelled <em>Ch&#226;teau Pape Cl&#233;ment</em> from an ivory cup.  

She heard talk of tomorrow&#39;s dignitaries and processes and rehearsal and termination.

She saw her daughter&#39;s smile glint, as perfect as ever, against the fog...or was that the beloved of someone else?  Hers, or James&#39;, or...

There was only a bit of lucidity left for her before death.  Triboulet came to, still taking in sensations at the edge of her perception, looking up at Illyn&#39;s cold eyes with her own glazed over pair.  For a moment, she heard her name called, and something about a winner - well, by her own record, that man right there was the winner.  His look of pity, something she understood well, was just a last bit of remorse before he made off with Ruler to whatever fantasy life they had given themselves just now.  She was sprawled in a pile of her own blood, and had nothing more she could do to him.

She was <em>this</em> close to victory, but just short.

...

Heh.

Short.

A stupid joke like that made her feel just a little better about losing.  Characteristic of her, she almost faded out entirely, distracted by appreciating her own simpleton comedy, before she saw that golden cup fall from Illyn&#39;s hands.

Triboulet&#39;s consciousness yanked itself closer from the end.  It was out of the winner&#39;s hands?  Illyn was on one knee?  Injured?  Shot?  Acquiescing?  She barely could move her head and her eyes sat lazy in their sockets, but where was Ruler?  A hint of that flat voice came through her deafened ears: <em>Make your <strong>wish?</strong></em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1148034620013674607 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1148034620013674607><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, September 3, 2023 6:19 PM">6:19 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>For a brief moment before it was finally, fully concluded, Triboulet was both more rapt as a member of the audience than she ever had been, more hopeful as well, and yet incredibly confused.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The formula to bring Triboulet to life was very similar to Illyn&#39;s formula for resurrecting his wife. He made several heavy changes to account for a Servant&#39;s state of being, and after a long ponder within his mental rooms, Illyn confirmed their existence before standing up. To the outside world, the process took only a few seconds.

Using the connection he still had with the Holy Grail, due to his connection with Laplace&#39;s Demon, he silently fulfilled the technical work to activate the Holy Grail.

The Holy Grail shuddered, before erupting into a pillar of light.

&quot;Your wishes are granted.&quot; Illyn watched as the light returned Triboulet to the world.

By the end of it, James held nothing in his hand. The Grail was spent completely and thus had no reason to maintain its form any longer. The light faded, leaving behind no traces of whether it actually worked or not. That is, however, until he glanced towards Nicolette and saw her. Just as the wish intended, her body was remade. Her life-threatening injuries were gone.

&quot;It actually worked...&quot; If it worked for her, then the magic must&#39;ve made its way towards his daughter. That confirmation he got from seeing her was everything he needed to know; he did it. <em>He won</em>.

It would surprise no one then that after his task was finished that his body would shut down and force the man to rest. His body fell flat onto the ground. The only signs that he was still clinging onto the world of the living was the soft breaths that lifted his body ever so gently.

Six long years did he work tirelessly to achieve something people told him was impossible, and soon he started to begin that as well near the end. Six long years of stress finally being given the chance to be let go. Countless nights without any proper sleep finally caught up to him it would seem. This would mark the first sleep this man would experience in so long. Hopefully, it was to be the first of many.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1148588393526206484 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1148588393526206484><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 5, 2023 7:00 AM">7:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She wasn&#39;t equipped to understand all that occurred to her in that brief window of time where everything about her being changed - to Illyn it was a mere set of equations; to her it might as well have been rewriting a play that you&#39;ve never seen and still capturing its intent.

She wouldn&#39;t ever find someone who would share in this sensation in her life, so, unlike many of her personal experiences, this anecdote would 
be kept to herself.

Soon, she lay in the dirt again, once more on her back but all the better for it.  Intact.  Clean.  No longer in pain.  Alive, but ultimately mortal.  She bolted upright, and took a deep breath of the soot-filled air.

Triboulet pressed her fingers into her other palm, almost disbelieving.  The strangest change wasn&#39;t how readily her hand felt pain just from being pinched, or even how little pressure she could make with two fingers now - it was how <em>simple</em> it felt.  Time had slowed to just the pace of the clock ticking; no longer did her perception race with speed that&#39;d enter the realm of the unbelievable.  Her eyes didn&#39;t catch and process almost every detail in front of her, the whorls on her fingers and the specks of ash falling like snow all became a single collage of...<em>there.</em>

Her mind had dulled.  Her body was surely just as weak.  With nothing but a sharp tongue, what was she now, in the eyes of others?

Nothing of note.  And in God&#39;s name, <em>did she ever love it.</em>

The moment she stopped prodding herself she started to laugh.  It wasn&#39;t vicious or smug or anything like usual, because for once, she was simply laughing from pure joy.  Triboulet almost leaped to James&#39; side, placing her hands - thank you, God, for not deciding to recreate her without hands - on his side and beaming down at his face.  &quot;It&#39;s over!  It&#39;s over!&quot; she shouted, just as he slipped into a content sleep.  &quot;We&#39;ve done it!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1148702421976104981 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1148702421976104981><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, September 5, 2023 2:33 PM">2:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Her laughter continued, as she laughed for herself.  Her Master&#39;s passing out wasn&#39;t his passing, as he breathed, and there was nothing left that could take this joy from either of them.

Though, there was one.

She slowly grew quiet, though the mirth that overcame her only dimmed, not dwindled.  Kneeling above James, she looked up at Illyn - at a man she couldn&#39;t possibly fathom in intent.  A question of a person.  He seemed cruel before, and here he was, allowing them the victory...

&quot;...do you...think you&#39;ll find what you want on your own?&quot;  That was the only way she could&#39;ve imagined this came about.  &quot;Without the Grail?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

She was no longer a Servant fighting in a Holy Grail War. She was simply Triboulet, living her life in a world that had once passed her by.

As she celebrated, Illyn felt a stirring in his heart, where an incomprehensible obsession had once smoldered and burned. Evi was gone. She would never return to this world again. The Illyn Mariston who had killed his mother and hundreds of people would never have his mission fulfilled.

&quot;An interesting question.&quot; Illyn scratched his cheek. &quot;Huh. What <em>do</em> I want, now?&quot;

He was a copy born from a war that he held little interest in originally. IBM had copied over him so many times that Illyn never imagined that he&#39;d live to chase something beyond Evi&#39;s long shadow. He hadn&#39;t thought about anything else in a decade.

Yet his purpose had been replaced. There was work to do.

&quot;I suppose I&#39;ll return to the Atlas Institute.&quot; Illyn picked up IBM, now a briefcase, and hoisted the heavy briefcase over his shoulder like a everyday businessman. &quot;There&#39;s a project that requires my aid. My colleagues are working on <strong>Noah&#39;s Ark</strong>, and I refuse to let them use my shoddy work from over ten years ago.&quot;

Noah&#39;s Ark? The legendary ship used to save every living species from God&#39;s wrath. It was also a project that had been announced to be under development on live television. Laplace and Illyn had seen a news report on it in James&#39;s store.

Was Illyn connected to it?

&quot;<strong>I will meet Laplace&#39;s Demon again.</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s voice was soft. &quot;I made a promise. This, I will not break. May we never meet again, Triboulet.&quot;

With a nod, the Master of Rider and Ruler turned and walked away. After a moment, he stopped. &quot;Triboulet.&quot; He finally said.

&quot;<strong>Tell James to not speak of me to any other magi. I&#39;d rather not kill any more Enforcers from the Mage&#39;s Association. It&#39;s tiresome work.</strong>&quot;

With that, Illyn Mariston disappeared into the distance.
