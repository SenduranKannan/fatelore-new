<em>You are different.</em>

<em>Your existence is akin to a flowerbed of ill omens. Your wishes and desires will disrupt the delicate balance of the world, leading it to utter disarray. Therefore, it is imperative that you control and suppress your will.</em>

<em>Do not be afraid of the cold. Do not long for warmth. Resist the temptation to connect with others. And above all else...</em>

<em>Do not allow yourself to possess a heart.</em>

These convictions governed my actions. I refrained from forming bonds with people. I avoided entangling myself in any events that could potentially alter the course of history. The world exists out there, independent of me, and so I chose to watch quietly from the sidelines, hidden behind a thick slab of glass. My sole purpose was to observe, and faithfully relay my observations to those who held me captive...

On June 30, 1999, a particular observation shattered my belief. I came to the conclusion that passive detachment was not the way things were meant to be.

So I smashed the glass, and reached in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

In the short amount of time they had spent as a Servant, Rider had voraciously taken in a multitude of new experiences, cramming them into their limited existence. Bantering with their Master, battling other Magi and Servants, and gorging themselves on the binding contract of a Command Spell...they had experienced it all.

Yet, it remained an indisputable fact that it had barely been 2 days since the Demon obtained a real body. Barely 2 days since they had been elevated to the rank of a Servant. Despite the whirlwind of adventures they had packed into their schedule, these past forty-odd hours seemed but a fleeting moment in their extensive lifespan. Was that enough for the Demon to get used to their new identity? Did they wholeheartedly embrace the role of a Servant, or did they still perceive themselves as something different?

Regardless, attaining the status of a Servant brought with it a great privilege.

Rider&#39;s body tingled as magical energy pulsed through the plants in the garden, causing them to flourish wildly: flowers blooming in kaleidoscopic hues, vines slithering around nearby structures, roots spreading far and wide underneath the earth that encapsulated the entire island. Sister Rosula&#39;s garden had come alive in the wake of her absence. It had become a focal point of an extraordinary coalescence of energy, waiting for release...

&#39;I wonder how long we have,&#39; Rider murmured as they took another step forward, crushing soft foliage under their still-bare feet. &#39;Until the Holy Grail fully manifests.&#39;

Rider spoke with a hint of genuine excitement. Though they had <em>observed</em> the Grail countless times before, today would mark the first time they get to do so up close and in person. A truly special occasion.

&#39;It&#39;s only a matter of time now,&#39; they said in a sing-song tone. Then, as if suddenly remember something important, Rider thrust the tip of the shovel into the earth and spun around to face the half-ruined church. &#39;Oh, but I doubt we&#39;d have enough time to get the place ready for our guests, nor a cup of tea prepared.

Such a magnificent specimen. He would need to gather samples to see how flora and fauna reacted to such potent magical energy. It was not necessary, but he simply <em>needed</em> to know.

&quot;Minutes. Hours.&quot; He continued as his briefcase let out a whirring noise as it made a copy of the flower. &quot;Should you not know these things? You can see the future, so you should know exactly when the Holy Grail will appear, down to the femtosecond.&quot;

Contrary to Rider, Illyn was relaxed. He let his Servant do as much work as they dictated necessary, all while Illyn performed mundane scans and experiments. He had helped originally, but the Holy Grail simply wasn&#39;t very interesting. Its effects on others were far more desirable.

At the end of the day, it was just a ball of magical energy.

Yet it was a ball of energy that had caused much change in the world. In Illyn. In Rider. This Holy Grail War had been a great experiment. Soon, it&#39;d come to an end.

&quot;Our guests consist of the deluded, the destructive, and the deluded. Do not be concerned for them. If anything, be more concerned for me.&quot; Illyn leaned towards IBM. &quot;You&#39;re a Ruler, Rider. I&#39;m just another person vying for the Grail.&quot;

<strong>DING!</strong>

IBM spat out a cup of herbal tea and a biscuit, made from robbing a store belonging to one of the surviving Masters. He raised an eyebrow towards his Servant. &quot;You were saying?&quot;

That didn&#39;t meant that he had been the one and only perpetrator. Most likely that someone else had deal with them. She and Saber had focused on dealing with their wounds making sure their equipment was on top shape. 

Their chase for the killers had leave Gloria and Saber a bit out of the loop of how the war was going. She had no idea if any of the other masters nor servants she had met but hadn&#39;t fight were still alive or had just run away? She wonder if that was a possibility but decided to stop thinking about it. 

Gloria was currently in state of relaxation, the main objective she had been chasing alongside Saber for the past few days was over so she could help but stop and relax.

&quot;....!!!!&quot; It was then when she felt it. Even someone as ignorant of how the world of magecraft worked could feel there was something weird happening. 

She could many conjectures and hypothesis about what was happening but the sudden burst of energy she could feel send shiver all through her spine. Confusing and shocking her like nothing had ever before. Her insticts screamed at her that she and Saber needed to go there. 

Because in there lied the miracle she been searching for. That was the one and only chance she had to save that child future

A pair of hands, indistinguishable from the background surrounding it, pried over the edge of a nearby roof.  Eyes, narrow and cold, leered from above and toward the site of the church.

<em>If you trust this idiot&#39;s words, o&#39; Master, then I promise you that I&#39;m not mistaken.  &#39;tis, indeed, the</em> Prize.  <em>The end.</em>

Triboulet knelt at the edge, and though she kept her eyes trained, her mind wandered.  At the beginning of this reincarnation, this clown had felt nothing.  She was tired and morose from the moment she walked in, only putting on a show of happiness to extend the moment.  There was a time where she believed all of this was going to be a pointless few days in a new life, and there was little that could make her heart sing, other than the spite of others.

It was only at the end, where victory wasn&#39;t just imaginable, but <em>feasible,</em> that she had the time to notice how much her heart was pounding.  Sweat formed on her exposed hands and she knew it wasn&#39;t from the Egyptian heat, but the fervor.  The excitement that she <em>allowed herself to feel.</em>  Doom was hanging at the back of her head, and she was just about to push it out the door - all of it was within reach.

Success!  Outside of the field the world wanted, even.  Recognition!  Moments becoming days, and years.  The possibility of an escape from all of this fear.

Life.

Triboulet&#39;s servile existence was a constant barrier to life, and soon, there&#39;d be no one to please but...

...well.  Perhaps someone, but let us focus once more.  Getting too lost in the future&#39;s just going to put a thumbtack in your foot in the now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133537838537900043 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133537838537900043><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, July 25, 2023 6:14 PM">6:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>James, there are two already waiting near...I don&#39;t recognize one, but the other seems...slightly familiar.

She squinted at Rider from this distance.  <em>Something about him makes me want to punt him.</em>

Never. Since his summoning, he never got the chance to ask for himself and has since lost the reason to even bother remembering his foes. All he could recall are their interactions when they had first met one another.

Ah, let’s think of something else. It brings questions that shouldn’t be thought of. Questions that, for some reason, lead him back to that one time in life. Was that really what he wanted…?

!!!

 ”Oh, uh, very well. Fast as the wind we go!”

Saber snapped out of his thoughts upon hearing Gloria’s orders. There he too felt the instinctive drive to head over to this certain place. The culmination of the entire ritual begins there.

He scoops Gloria up and off the ground for a faster mode of transport, heading up and leaping from rooftop to rooftop until they could see the Church. The end is steadily approaching, but it could come sooner if they fail their play.

It’s a little too late, but Saber felt for his sword on his back. Whew, good thing it’s still there. Never again. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The realization of his wish was just within his grasp. He needs only to reach out and grasp it and it will be his. However, with the other hands grasping at it as well, he knew that his job was far from over. There was still some work that needed to be taken care of. 

<em>&#39;While your greatest strength may be your ace in the hole, you&#39;re still an Assassin, Tri. The others will surely engage the moment they see each other. That is when we will strike.&#39;</em>

James stood with his back against a wall, hidden from sight, while he relied on Triboulet to be his eyes. Mister Fluffybuns hung from his hip. A constant companion from the start. Maybe his daughter&#39;s protection actually did work. The thought made him smirk. <em>&#39;Just hang on for a few moments later, sweetie. I&#39;ll be seeing you soon.&#39;</em> He thought to himself while he steeled himself for what&#39;s to come.

&#39;We can&#39;t dawdle for too long...&#39; 

<em>&#39;You&#39;re right. Drop me off down in the alleyway. I&#39;ll wait for your signal to come out and strike. Hopefully we can count on Saber and his Master&#39;s word but don&#39;t rely on that being the case.&#39;</em> 

A quick last minute check was made. Four more Silver Nails. The rest were either lost, broken, or left behind. No matter. As long as he still had one, he could still fight. He did have another weapon, though.

<em>&#39;Tri. My Eyes are useless with so many enemies around. They could easily take the opportunity to finish me off while I&#39;m asleep. Despite that, we should still use them. I&#39;ll call out your true name if I find an opportunity to use it. At most, this will only give you a second. Risky, I know, but that might be all we need to make it out of this together.&#39;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133657504354676776 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133657504354676776><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 2:10 AM">2:10 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She stood and made her way over to her Master, relaying <em>Better to save it for when we&#39;re down to one and one, yes?  Those eyes of yours will save us a lot of trouble if it&#39;s just us and them, but who knows how many remain.  I&#39;ll keep them in mind, though.</em>

Another ride on the Royal Valois Express for James.  She didn&#39;t give him a warning beyond a tap on the side, a pre-planned alert, before she took (as much as she could of) his torso and bounded upward.  The force of the leap would&#39;ve made James&#39; stomach churn from the force, but by this point, perhaps all of the times he&#39;s used his Servant as a valet had given him a stronger gut.

The sunset skyline of Berenice would eventually fade from its importance, but as they rode along it, they had a moment to reacquaint themselves with the umber sky behind a dark projection of the city.  Triboulet found some poeticism in it all, that the final battle would play out with the dying day, but she couldn&#39;t find anything to make fun of it.  She left it there.

Like that, she also left James there.  Close to the church, the two of them landed and Triboulet dropped the man on his feet.  <em>&quot;Don&#39;t let yourself get too distracted if one of them does something drastic,&quot;</em> she whispered.  <em>&quot;Remember: &#39;tis only I keeping you safe.  Our dear rabbit friend&#39;s not going to shout to keep you on your toes.&quot;</em>

Mr. Fluffybuns had a poor track record of contributing to the team effort, as much as it&#39;d sadden James to hear that.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133838518125346848 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133838518125346848><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 2:09 PM">2:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>With that reminder, she performed a vanishing act - somewhat literally, as she only disappeared after waving her hand in front of her face for some reason - and returned to scouting.

Healed. Then bled some more. A mess they had become, alternating between bleeding and healing, as he sustained them with Magecraft while trying to tend to Pyg&#39;s wounds. In hindsight, he should have prioritized stitching up the puppet first, before fusing the creature with his spoils of war. But it was too late to dwell on that now.

Lindwyrm&#39;s hide. A truly marvelous gift imbued with incredible properties. Obtaining it had been a stroke of luck, or perhaps it had all been predestined from the very moment he and Ann had laid eyes upon each other on that plane. Lachlan was no fatalist, but the way things fell into place so perfectly sometimes made even him a smidge more curious about a certain mysterious force at work.

<em>&lt;I suppose it&#39;s a good thing that so many others helped wear down the Dragon and his Master before us.&gt;</em> Lachlan spoke to Bill, then carefully closed another stitch, cutting the thread with his teeth. <em>&lt;Though I&#39;d have preferred if we hadn&#39;t cut it so close.&gt;</em>

He was referring to the leylines, which had become increasingly agitated shortly after Lindwyrm&#39;s defeat. Something was happening to Berenice, something significant, ominous: the island had started churching, splitting, cracking along innumerous lines, all converging onto a particular spot.

What was now coming to an end would soon give birth to something new.

There was no need for discretion now, as the mere sight of his grotesque puppets had frightened any witness off the streets, leaving them mostly empty.

&#39;I doubt we&#39;re the only ones headed towards the Grail,&#39; Lachlan addressed Bill with his normal voice. &#39;Those who remain must have similar thoughts. Think you can take them all on?&#39;

It was a question, a challenge, and a request for assurance all at once. What answer did he expect in return? Lachlan doublechecked his condition. His magic circuits were operating at full capacity. He had an abundance of mana to spare, and his puppets—Pygmalion, Leapfrog, and Dancer—were docile and fed. If there was a fight awaiting him at the end, then he was prepared to face it.

By all means, he should be. He had to be. Victory—it was what he wanted, was it not?

Lachlan kept thumbing his lighter with nervous energy. He had taken it from Roland, amongst a few other trinkets in the blonde&#39;s possession, before ushering him onto a taxi bound for Aswan city. He had finally managed to get rid of the thorn at his side, but it hadn&#39;t quite earned him the peace and quiet he had desired. 

<em>&#39;You think you&#39;ve got it all figured out. But at the end of the day...let&#39;s face it, Lachlan. You and I, we&#39;re still just young.&#39;</em>

Lachlan crushed his struggling thoughts with a snap of the lighter. <em>Old enough to know there&#39;s no coming back,</em> he stared at the back of Archer&#39;s red coat, and pushed Roland&#39;s parting words deep into the recesses of his heart.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Was this how it felt like to be completely drained of mana? It had taken him every ounce of strength to take down the giant wyrm. Every bullet in his chamber, every bone in his body, every last bit of grit he had down to his soul.

Now, through a rain of bullets and a cloud of smoke, they had triumphed. His Master was already collecting the spoils, gathering something from Berserker&#39;s remains.

<em>&lt;Easy for you to say. Ya weren&#39;t the one dealing with it!&gt;</em> Bill spat, sounding insulted. His heart was still palpitating and his body filled to the brim with excitement. He was an outlaw; nothing more, nothing less. For a footnote like him to take down a grand beast was something people could only dream about.

Happiness was bursting at his seams. Was this pride? Satisfaction? The thought that even as a Servant, he still had potential to grow?

He delivered a forceful slap to the back of his Master, rattling their bones. <em>&lt;But just today, I&#39;ll allow it! Not everyday that we take down a dragon, bahahahahah!&gt;</em> He cackled like a maniac, filling Lachlan&#39;s ears with an unpleasant noise. Had this idiot not realized yet that the Dowling wasn&#39;t referring to their Servant&#39;s performance?

It was only until Bill felt the tremors in the earth, the surge of mana underneath, that he realized what Lachlan had meant. A modern Servant that could barely perceive Magecraft would understandably struggle to notice the difference in the air, but Bill felt like a fool nonetheless, having the wool pulled out of his eyes.

&quot;What the hell-&quot;

It was a beacon. Like a bell ringing at noon. The Grail had given its ultimatum, warning the others that it had grown full. Several Masters and Servants had yet to pay their dues, and therefore, the Grail called for them. It was their turn to sacrifice. Through their blood, a victor would be chosen.

In Bill&#39;s eyes, there was no other winner than him and his Master. They had already made their preparations, abandoning all forms of secrecy as Pyg&#39;s monstrous form bathed in the Egyptian sun. Crowds dispersed from the horror, no different than how saloons would empty in Bill&#39;s wake.

&quot;We just took down a fucking <em>dragon.</em>&quot; Bill replied with a snort to Lachlan&#39;s question. &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be fine. What do ya expect, a man wolf or a clown? Oh please.&quot; He giggled, spitting from the rooftop. As cocky as he sounded, he did have a point: Lindwyrm was possibly the most monstrous opponent they had faced yet, and now it was nothing more than another tool in Lachlan&#39;s arsenal. It felt like their initial concerns were starting to shrink down.

After all, what did a dragon have to fear? 

Themselves, maybe. Something Bill quickly picked up on as he felt his boss&#39; mind grow perturbed. Silent, but stormy. He turned around, flapping his coat in his Master&#39;s face and tapping their shoulder.

&quot;This is what you&#39;ve prepared for.&quot; Archer reminded them. &quot;If ya don&#39;t feel ready now, it was all pointless.&quot; He raised his arm, pointing in the general direction of the Grail&#39;s mana signature. Not surprising that it was holed up in the church.

&quot;And it&#39;ll be simple. See, what yer gonna do is just walk right in, straight through the front gate. Yer puppets are too fucking big to sneak around anyway.&quot; He cast a nasty side glare at Pyg. &quot;But you gotta act like a target. Look foolish. Bring people out &#39;cause they think yer an easy kill, then BAM!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133863832704532550 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133863832704532550><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 3:50 PM">3:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>slap</em>

He slapped Pyg&#39;s hide, feeling more like a caress than anything else. 

&quot;Ya catch them off guard. Their bullet didn&#39;t kill you. You laugh in their face and then I go RAT-TA-TA-TA-TAT!&quot; Bill mimicked the sound of a machine gun. Lachlan couldn&#39;t tell if this plan sounded patronizing or not, giving him vivid flashbacks to a certain arm wrestling game.

&quot;I was in the shadows. They never saw it coming. Short, simple and sweet.&quot; His Servant laughed, clasping their hands in satisfaction. They spun the plan more like a fairy tale than a plan of assault, but hey if that&#39;s the way of the Wild West, then who was Lachlan to judge?

&quot;...That&#39;s just the way I&#39;d do it though.&quot; Bill shrugged, loosening his shoulders. Now <em>that</em> Lachlan had never expected: For his Servant to showcase a potential option instead of <em>the plan.</em> Usually, Archer would just do the first thing that came to mind and execute it perfectly, no matter how horrid the initial plan was. For him to stop, think and reflect, well-

It felt unnerving.

Even more so was the fact that he hadn&#39;t forced Lachlan to follow him. He had already analyzed his Master&#39;s strengths and adapted accordingly. Lachlan was no good at what Bill did, his puppets weren&#39;t assassins (usually), so Bill wouldn&#39;t use them as such. Instead, they had their own, unique strengths that he could take advantage of.

It was gunpowder and gasoline. An explosive chain reaction that was ready to burst.

&quot;We should probably get a move on.&quot; Bill spoke up, looking at the time. Clouds filled the skies, enveloping the church in shadows and shade. Even the world itself was inciting them to make a move on, to grab their rightful birth right. &quot;Ya have another plan in mind, boss? I&#39;m listening. Make it quick, though.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Did you hit your head against that Berserker? Want me to take a look at it? I&#39;ll even do it for free!&#39;

He extended his hand towards the Archer, but quickly caught himself in the act and pulled it back. Archer&#39;s glee was infectious, but one of them had to keep a level head. That was the excuse he made for himself, at least.

&#39;We&#39;ll do it your way,&#39; he placed his hand back on Pyg, unsure of where else to rest it. &#39;Covert operations has never been my strong suit. I don&#39;t think you need me to explain why,&#39; he added, kicking Pyg with his heel to emphasize his point.

Normally, charging into the open would be a suicidal move for any magus, exposing them for free target practice. But things were a bit different for a puppeteer like him. Contrary to popular belief, drawing the enemy&#39;s attention actually worked out in his favor. After all...

&#39;That&#39;s how you work best, yeah?&#39; Lachlan shot a finger gun into the distance, where the dilapidated silhouette of the church cast its shadow against the setting sun. &#39;I take the heat, you do your thing and pick them off. Learned that the hard way, but I suppose the donuts were delicious and made it worth the effort.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133863946655387730 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133863946655387730><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 3:50 PM">3:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

With a carefree grin, Rider dipped their head shamelessly close to the cup, meaning to take a sip of the scalding hot tea. &#39;It&#39;s not a proper tea party if there&#39;s nowhere to sit. I suppose we can all mingle on foot, but who will be serving the treats?&#39;

&#39;Perhaps, me?&#39;

Rider spun on their heels, eyes scanning the buildings surrounding the garden and lingering a few seconds longer as they captured something in their sights. At the same time, the nearby Masters and Servants heard an adolescent&#39;s voice inside their minds.

<em>&lt;Come out and play, mes chers.

Though, despite that trust, James still placed an arm around Triboulet to hold onto her on the way down. Thankfully, the contents of his last meal didn&#39;t come up to fight him before the final engagement happened.

<em>&#39;I managed to make it this far with a Servant like yourself, who&#39;s to say animating stuffed animals isn&#39;t in the cards?&#39;</em> A little friendly jab was made with a slight smirk towards her. It was a slight improvement over his previous attempts so some progress is better than no progress at least! Perhaps James simply needed some of the tension eased up on to relax. For an event like this, any fool who claimed to be calm was either lying or just hiding it.

Once in the alleyway, James kept close to the ground with a Silver Nail in hand and remained hidden from sight, awaiting his Servant&#39;s signal to engage.

<em>&#39;They should draw most of the attention, fortunately. I doubt anyone is expecting a team up this late into the war anyways.&#39;</em> Who wouldn&#39;t want to take out the Saber first, after all. The superstition of them being the strongest Class isn&#39;t helped by the fact that they were one of the ones who made it to the end. The final boss for any remaining participant, so to speak.

Perfect for their plan.

Then, he heard <em>his</em> voice.

<em>&#39;Oh no...&#39;</em> Memories of everything he has showed him started to flow again and a headache crept up on him. His body still cursed him for putting it through that whole experience it would seem.

<em>&#39;Let&#39;s not wait, Tri. We might have to show our hand much earlier than we would&#39;ve liked.&#39;</em> Damned kid. It was unlikely that he would allow those two to just hide in the shadow after that little declaration of his. If he was going to have a spotlight shined upon him, James would prefer to be much closer as a result.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 4:35 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1133870834407194715 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1133870834407194715><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, July 26, 2023 4:17 PM">4:17 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Soft and fluffy biscuits had far more nutritional value than tea, anyway. &quot;Rewards are distributed when something exceeds the expected outcome. If you consistently do good, then you are rewarded when you do <strong>better</strong>.&quot;

How did you get better at predicting events that were already going to happen? It seemed like an extremely loaded expectation.

Then again, Illyn always expected a better result than what came before. His Riders had brought him back from death, after all.

&quot;I&#39;ll allow it. You can meet them.&quot; Illyn sighed as he poured himself a cup of tea from another printed cup. Additionally, IBM was printing more. &quot;Better you than me, anyway. I am an unexpected variable, and you are expected. Who better than the Ruler to announce the end?

&quot;<strong>Besides...</strong>

&quot;<strong>People are just so tiring.</strong>&quot; Illyn slammed IBM shut and converted it into a Sony Walkman. Rider&#39;s proclamation to the surviving Masters and Servants washed over him like water.

It was really hard to get worked up over the end of the Holy Grail War when you were mathematically determined to win. When you <em>knew</em> everything, the outcome suddenly became far less enticing.

&quot;Off we go. I&#39;ll simply slink about on the sidelines until I am needed to activate the Grail. If somebody asks, I&#39;ll simply say I am the janitor.&quot;

Was that... a joke? From Illyn? Atlas magi did not joke. They barely even smiled. Maybe he was changing, after all.

After a while, a visual on the Church was established. As Saber closes in, like blips on the radar, he could detect the presence of another party. From the looks of it, he and Gloria arrived just on time.

…

We’re going to win, you say. Well, there can be no other choices but victory or death. Once they set their foot on the ground, there is no turning back. There will be no second chances, it all ends here.

And so they descend.

Saber takes a long jump forward before landing just within sight of the Church. Falling, falling, then, touchdown. On the ground, Saber places Gloria down and then, with blade in hand, he prepares himself for what would come next.

With Ruler being about, he&#39;d be on them soon enough.  James was right there, though she had no idea how kindly this second encounter of theirs would transpire...

For a little kid, she found him a huge pain in the ass.

<em>We shouldn&#39;t be surprised the Master of Ceremonies hasn&#39;t showed all two feet of himself to us.  Guardian of the Grail, he is.  Whereupon I meet God next, I shall inquire what the hell he was thinking in assigning that runt to the role.</em>

To enter into the field was going to be dangerous, just as much as being within the jaws of Lindwyrm, if not more.  Couldn&#39;t they wait for Saber to make his entrance?  He&#39;d come in, screaming and flailing his sword and they could sit back.  The next Servant after this horned one would arrive any moment, and they couldn&#39;t promise on being so cocksure that they&#39;d simply stand in the open.

This was a bad idea, to arrive next to this meeting at the Grail&#39;s door.  It was James&#39; idea, so no surprise there.

The only thing she had to protect herself...was the little likelihood she had at being funny.

God preserve her.

In making her entrance, the fool leaped up into the air and landed in the sand...in a perfect split, legs splayed across the ground, front and back.  Her smile suggested nothing but self-assuredness, and her hands were placed on her hips as she looked on over to those who were here first.

&quot;Don&#39;t let me split your attention,&quot; she confidently said, warranting a groan from anyone involved.  &quot;&#39;tis a fine evening, and this little pain in front of you is feeling a plainly greater chain of agony than any you could ordain.  My legs come untwain, and yet, I remain!&quot;  

She doffed her at at the two of them.  &quot;That is to say, or not at all, that we&#39;ll be killing each other shortly.  To whom do I owe the pleasure?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Come on!&#39; 

With a kick, they dislodged a broomstick from the wall and held it against Illyn. The broomstick showed signs of use, slightly too short for Illyn&#39;s stature, and appeared somewhat crude. But then again, against someone dressed as finely as Illyn, most garden tools would feel out of place.

Rider seemed to enjoy the farce, however. &#39;If not the uniform, then at least...a cap.&#39; They mimicked grabbing the rim of a janitor&#39;s cap with their free hand. &#39;Seven percent polyester, ninety-three percent cotton. A modest shade of blue. Not the most exciting hat, but it&#39;s better than leaving your head bare.&#39;

Was Rider obsessed with hats, or were they simply pulling Illyn&#39;s leg? Perhaps the French&#39;s obsession with hats had become such an intrinsic facet of life that it had left an indelible mark, even on Rider&#39;s saint graph. Rider tiptoed around the Atlas magus, carrying their dainty teacup like a mini trophy, and only barely pulled it out of the way when a nimble figure descended from the roof.

&#39;Oh my!&#39; Rider held a hand to their mouth as the obviously dressed clown executed a perfect split upon landing.

&#39;We&#39;re not so poor that we can&#39;t afford you a seat,&#39; they said to Triboulet. &#39;I hope you don&#39;t mind, but my janitor and I are in the process of tidying up this place.&#39;

Rider quickly slipped into their role. If Illyn was to play a janitor, then they would assume an equally fitting one...perhaps, that of the party&#39;s host.

Except that they didn&#39;t quite look the part.

Cheap, white sundress fluttered in the northward breeze. A price tag poked out from under the fabric, embarrassingly forgotten before Rider chugged the original copy into IBM. The label on the tag seemed to have struck a familiar chord with the lovely intruder...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134201052787380305 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134201052787380305><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 27, 2023 2:10 PM">2:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He hadn&#39;t invited it in.

<em>&lt;Who was that?&gt;</em> Lachlan chased after the voice, but there was no response. <em>&lt;Bill?&gt;</em>

It couldn&#39;t have been Archer. The voice was far too young, and far too calm. Nevertheless, it had effortlessly breached his mental barrier and intruded upon his thoughts. If he had to wager a guess...

&#39;A Servant,&#39; he warned Archer. &#39;One that we haven&#39;t encountered before. Be on your guard.&#39;

For the time being, he chose to communicate verbally. Until he could discern the capabilities of this mental magecraft user, it was best not to rely on telepathy unless absolutely necessary, lest someone eavesdropped on the other end of the line. 

It wasn&#39;t as if he and Archer were trying to execute anything super convoluted, at any rate. All they needed was a break, an entry point, a target for him to sic his puppets on. And as he surveyed the buildings ahead...

<em>Bingo.</em>

Lachlan nodded toward a distant rooftop against the backdrop of the sun&#39;s orange glow, his sharp eyes honing in on a particular detail that made the tips of his fingers tingle.

&#39;See that?&#39; He patted Pyg on the shoulder, directing the creature&#39;s attention to the small dot darting towards the church. &#39;Looks like we&#39;ve found your leftovers. Think you&#39;re ready to clean up the plate?&#39;

It was that woman and her Servant from the sewers. It seemed that they had been fortunate enough in the War to make it thus far...but this would mark the end of their journey. Lachlan gave Pyg another mental nudge, before dismounting from the creature and sending it on its merry way with a slap on its behind.

&#39;We can pick up right where we left off last time,&#39; he said jokingly to Bill, who had undoubtedly spotted the Saber pair as well.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 3:44 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>

This time, there was no stench of the sewers to invade her senses, which only made the bloodlust even more potent and pure. Gloria didn&#39;t even need to turn her head before the horrific sight she had encountered resurfaced in her memories—the giant flesh monster she had tried to defeat before. 

And there it was, as good as new. With one powerful kick, Pygmalion leapt high into the air.

Then it descended, like a comet shooting out of the sky, hurtling toward where the flame shaman landed.

For the first time since the war had started, perhaps, Bill was finally in his element, taking initiative and infiltrating enemy territory. Simply see the church as a carriage, a train, or even the local liquor store, and you would understand why an outlaw like Cherokee Bill was so feared. Silent and deadly was an apt descriptor.

He took refuge in the shade, taking notice of the various participants that had gathered. Saber and their Master were an eyesore, the Servant especially. He remembered that sword well and how annoying it was to get around those gusts of wind. Getting rid of that ability would probably be his main priority.

He was already aiming down his sights, ready to shoot Takeru&#39;s skull, only to hear something else speak to him. A child&#39;s voice.

<em>&lt;What the fuck?&gt;</em> Bill exclaimed in disbelief, only to be met by Lachlan&#39;s own question. So, it wasn&#39;t his Master, yet it was telepathy without a doubt. Someone had invaded their brain well enough to start dropping weird messages inside. That was a bad sign.

<em>&lt;Great, another one.&gt;</em> Archer grumbled in Lachlan&#39;s crevice, still using telepathy despite the latter&#39;s thoughts on the contrary. <em>&lt;Who are they? Can&#39;t be Saber from that voice.&gt;</em> He scoped out the church with his eyes, but to no avail. Whoever they were, they were either inside, in another section of the building or not there at all. 

<em>&lt;Why are ya talking to yerself? You&#39;ll give me away!&gt;</em> Bill scolded his Master, unaware of the Dowling&#39;s intentions. Not like it mattered, since they soon moved on to far more important things, such as Lachlan inciting Pyg to cut loose.

Same opponents. Same tools. Different outcome. This time, they would kill. Running away was no longer a possibility. Lachlan understood that well, ordering his prized puppet to immediately jump towards the enemy Master.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134216070719361154 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134216070719361154><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 27, 2023 3:09 PM">3:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;Don&#39;t get caught up in yer thoughts this time around, boy.&gt;</em> Bill warned, his voice clearly wary of Lachlan&#39;s excitement. <em>&lt;I&#39;m serious! Dontcha forget! I don&#39;t want a repeat of what happened last time EVER again!&gt;</em> Sheesh. Whatever Lachlan had done under Pyg&#39;s influence must have scarred Archer a fair bit.

<em>&lt;Now get moving. Ya don&#39;t wanna be a sitting duck.&gt;</em> Archer ordered as he scurried around, hopping from cover to cover. The black blot that swam within the shadows could barely be seen, especially since Saber and Gloria currently had their attention focused on Pyg. Archer knew this wouldn&#39;t last, since the moment he revealed his presence, Saber would be on the lookout for future attacks.

Which is why this first attack had to count.

It was obvious that Takeru would be the first to react to Pyg&#39;s assault. A puppet, no matter how big and strong, was no match for a Servant. Bill knew that plenty, which is why his gun was steaming hot with a faint trail of smoke emitting from the tip. He had already fired his bullet seconds ago.

<em>ZACK!</em>

Takeru felt a stinging pain in his arm. He perceived it only moments after it had happened. His eyes darted around to find a hole in the center of his wrist blood and bone matter spurting out like candy. Half of his fingers felt numb and his palm was twitching in response to the pain and blood loss, almost causing him to drop his sword. 

This injury was vicious, yet familiar. It was identical to the one he had received just weeks ago, from a particular Servant.

The gunslinger.

<em>BANG!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134216115875225691 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134216115875225691><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 27, 2023 3:09 PM">3:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
This time, he heard it. His eyes scanned the air with his superior speed and instincts. He saw it clearly: A projectile aimed straight for his sword arm. Archer&#39;s intent was clear: To sever Saber&#39;s arm from their weapon. He had already succeeded in injuring their wrist, making their sword unwieldy, but this was only a temporary advantage. If Saber survived for too long, they would simply get used to the wound or heal it through their Master&#39;s mana.

<em>&lt;Kill the fucking Master!&gt;</em> Bill screamed in Lachlan&#39;s head, as if that weren&#39;t the obvious thing to do. His objective was a bit deeper, however.

After all, how could Saber expect to protect both their life and their Master? Especially with a hand in that state? It was obvious what would happen if you tried to achieve both...

<em>&lt;Now, what will ya do...&gt;</em> Bill waited in anticipation, switching to another gravestone to use as cover. There was no doubt that they had heard the gunshot coming from the second bullet, so he had to make himself scarce. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Still as soon as they arrived she saw James and the clown but before she could even call to them she felt something coming at them. She knew the feeling really well without even turning,

&quot;Ignia!!&quot; she yelled as she finally turned, a white wall of flames erected between her, Saber and the monster coming at them.

She knew it wouldn&#39;t be enough, last time she had managed to stop and fight back thanks to Supay but that was her ace under her sleeve. She couldn&#39;t just use it right off the bat and risk becoming a liability for Saber. 

Still the time for planning was limited as the beast break through the ice wall as if it was papers, their meaty appendages ripping the ice into shreads without any real effort. She had no way of knowing what that beast was thinking nor she had any interest in them but if she could heard them she would agree 100%.

She jumped  back trying to minimize the impact of the shockwave created when the beast landed but it barely made a difference as she was still send flying. 

&lt;Saber!! Dont worry about me I will deal with this&gt; she told her servant through their mind link. If that beast was there then the brat and that cowboy were there too and she needed Saber to keep focused on that instead of worrying about her. 

She rolled as she landed a few meters back and shoot at the beast calling for their attention as she began to run away. She honestly had no idea if she could actually take it even with Supay but at the very least she needed to make it so it wouldn&#39;t get in Saber&#39;s way.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

One we&#39;re <em>fated</em> to win. I already know what you&#39;re implying.&quot;

Rider&#39;s Master was also implying something: he was going to throttle the French for their hat obsession. 

Illyn looked at IBM with a mixture of disgust and resignation? <em>Do I have a janitor&#39;s hat consisting of seven percent polyester, ninety-three percent cotton?</em> The answer was unfortunately yes. When the two had shamelessly robbed James&#39;s and Triboulet&#39;s store, Illyn had stolen as much as possible. He had <strong>scanned</strong> as much as possible.

There was definitely a hat in there. Would Illyn print it? No. The reason? Illyn looked up and found it instantly.

There was already one clown here. A second was not required.

Illyn watched as Assassin threw herself down. He seriously considered throwing IBM at her to mess up the fall.

&quot;I&#39;m not a...&quot; lllyn rolled his eyes into heaven. <em>Evi, I hope you&#39;re not seeing this.</em> &quot;Yes, I&#39;m the janitor. If everyone is unavailable, then I suppose that makes me the Overseer as well? This one—&quot; Illyn jerked his head towards Rider—&quot;is far too short to take the position. I&#39;m no socialite, but I&#39;ll offer you a chair.&quot;

A chair printed itself out of scraps of wood from IBM, suspiciously similar to the brand that was on sale next to the clothing aisle at a store Assassin and her Master would be intimately familiar with.

&quot;It&#39;s not dangerous. I&#39;m not in the running for the Grail anyways. I&#39;m a fraction that simplifies into nothing. Ignore me.&quot; Illyn said simply as he sipped at his tea. Despite his claims, his aura was positively strange. Everything from his vibe to his gaze was wrong.

The entry wound is clean and small while the exit wound is messy and bigger.

He made a guess on where it came from based on what he had observed. He turns to face the source, trying to see if there’s anyone there; to see if <em>he’s</em> there.

Trouble just as they arrived, a familiar one too. It’s not a welcome one, he knows how it went last time. In fact, it’ll probably only get worse from here. This place is not as cramped as the sewers, the cowboy can run all he wants. It’s a losing game, all it takes is just one misstep and it’s all over.

…

But the same could be said for them.

 ”If that is what you wish, very well.”

Just as he had acknowledged Gloria’s commands, another bullet is already on its way to open another hole in his body. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134342274671714314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134342274671714314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, July 27, 2023 11:31 PM">11:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Blood spurts out of his wound as he forces his blade to move, swiping the bullet in its travel.

Same old tricks, just as subtle and clear as last time, hah. Saber twirls his sword before resting something on the ground, the bullet. A neat little trick for them, he flicks it back to the sharpshooter with the tip of his sword.

Boom, whizz, pat. It chips the stone off a nearby gravestone. It’s far from Archer’s position, however the intent wasn’t to hit him back. It was to send a message, no more playing around.

 ”Just a flesh wound.”

He whispered to himself as he started his move. It’s difficult as a part of him wishes to stay near just in case the cowboy would make a cheap shot while he’s away. Another part of him is willing to trust in her abilities to survive till the end. Ultimately, he follows the lead of the latter.

He cautiously makes his way to where the culmination is being held. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

The moment two pairs saw each other, they immediately went at it. At least, that&#39;s what the noises he was hearing were telling him. No one else was around this part of the city, for good reason too, so it had to be other pairs. You would have to be insane otherwise. 

<em>&#39;Unless there is another gunslinger Servant running around, I suppose your drinking friend arrived, Tri. Saber and him are fighting from the sounds of it. I&#39;ll go for the brat once you lock down his Servant. I&#39;ll be more careful this time around. Don&#39;t worry.&#39;</em>

With that, James started to skulk closer towards to get into a better position to see where that brat was. The closer he managed to get without being spotted, the more likely he will be able to take out that damn brat before things got worse for either Triboulet or him. Thankfully, stealth was on his side. Or at least, he hoped that it was. There was no telling whether he was walking into a trap by himself or not. This wasn&#39;t the place to have doubts begin to cloud one&#39;s mind, though. If this was just a trap then he will cross that bridge once it arrives. For now, he got one chance to catch his opponent by surprise.

It took a bit of navigating but then his quarry was in his sights. James made a &#39;tsk&#39; sound with his tongue once he saw that the kid came protected with two of his puppets, the third being sent off else where probably. Of course it wasn&#39;t going to be as easy as walking up on him. However, he learned a bit from that mental trip he took with him; those things can lose their Master&#39;s hold on them. 

It wasn&#39;t the smartest plan of his but it&#39;s not like he had an amazing track record for better ones.

To hire help solely to clean up your own messes; that&#39;s the dream, isn&#39;t it?  Triboulet held her hand behind her neck and yanked upward to pull an imaginary rope, and rose to her tip-toes with only the strength of her legs pulling inward.  &quot;If it wouldn&#39;t be such a burden to the loathsome pair before me, I might invite myself.&quot;

She did not wait, and actually took a seat with the Servant and his...servant, planting legs over the cheap table and reclining.  Her hands came behind her head and she closed her eyes...this chair, for having been made a few seconds ago, was quite a fine piece of furniture!

Presenting such a casual air right within the enemy&#39;s presence was foolish.  If Mr. Marston had an urge to touch the little jingly bells on the ends of Triboulet&#39;s shoes, they were only few inches away from his table edge; that&#39;s how close they were.  But, wasn&#39;t this kind of feigned ignorance of danger funnier, and therefore <em>safer,</em> than a rude refusal of tea time with her foe?

&quot;Such a genteel-man,&quot; she said to Rider, &quot;giving me quarter with so little time left.  Poison my tea, would you?  I&#39;m terribly depressed, so dispense with the pleasantries and end me now.&quot;  

Her scepter was held up, and she pressed down on it from both ends, compressing and changing it to the form of a resplendent golden tea cup of her own.  She held it out, and looked up at the horned man and his servant.

...and his...wait, this dress again, <em>deja vu!</em>  Triboulet&#39;s otherwise calm look was marked with something fell, as her eyebrow twitched errantly.  This, and...and the shirt, the one the janitor wore!  The two things separate would&#39;ve only piqued her interest, but together, there was only one conclusion.  These were the chucklefucks responsible for all the <em>cleaning</em> they had to do once they came back from the hospital!  The material goods were worthless but they had to spend so much fucking time cleaning, my god...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134556646903914616 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134556646903914616><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 1:43 PM">1:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Served tea or denied, Triboulet smiled a bit brighter.

You and your Servant, we have a history together, yet it&#39;s unbound by a meeting.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;ve already robbed me and my Master dry, why not simply take the Grail?  Thieves act as thieves, animals as animals.&quot;  For how down to the wire things were now, Triboulet found herself surprisingly angered to have met the culprits in person.  The harsh way she spoke to them made it clear, as well.

And that&#39;s not all, there was something about the Servant in a dress.  From the moment she saw him, there--

The sound of gunfire, out of sight but close enough to give Triboulet a jolt, sent her tea cup out of her hands.  The last time she heard it, or didn&#39;t hear it, was bad enough to leave her still frayed.  Triboulet&#39;s head turned, and that thought from earlier was cut well short.

James was hopefully incorrect.  Fighting Bill again, with him <em>not</em> drunk as a skunk, wasn&#39;t the end she hoped for.

&quot;...do excuse this impudence mine, sir.&quot;  Triboulet nodded, picking up her scattered cup and tipped it to Rider in a show of deferrence.  &quot;We&#39;ll get back to the damages owed in a bit - I am no lawyer, but I can promise you that the court of law is even more of a cruel mistress than I.&quot;  She stood up from her seat and cut the tea party even shorter.  &quot;Don&#39;t go do anything drastic with the Grail, please?  It&#39;d hurt my feelings.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A Caster, maybe?&#39; Lachlan hazarded a guess, though he found it difficult to fully convince even himself. He&#39;d have felt at least <em>something</em> if he really had walked into a Caster&#39;s workshop. The lack of feedback was beginning to unnerve him...

But, of course, Bill remained oblivious to Lachlan&#39;s concerns about this mysterious Servant, being unfamiliar with magecraft himself. Instead, it seemed that Lachlan had somehow managed to unnerve this cowboy with his own incessant murmurs, and ended up receiving a rare stream of nagging directed at himself.

It was so ridiculously endearing, and so ridiculously stupid, that it sent goosebumps up his arms.

&#39;Relax,&#39; Lachlan chuckled. He then took his own advice and flung himself onto Leapfrog, allowing the mobile puppet to act as his new steed. &#39;The only thing I&#39;m giving away today is myself. I&#39;m playing the decoy, so excuse me for being a bit conspicuous. Maybe we should&#39;ve swapped outfits as well?&#39; He suggested with a smirk. The red coat Archer wore would have clashed horribly with his hair, but also successfully marked him an even more obvious target.

As Bill erased his presence and commenced his stealthy approach towards Saber, Lachlan reluctantly opened up his side of the telepathic link.

<em>&lt;The idea that another mental magecraft user is snooping around in my head irks me,&gt;</em> he explained with a hint of defensiveness in his voice. <em>&lt;For now, be careful about what you disclose. I&#39;ll try to get a better read on this Servant. Can you sense his whereabouts?&gt;</em>

Leapfrog scampered along the road as Lachlan communicated with Bill. Six of its limbs worked in tandem to scale the ground swiftly, while two more helped secure its master on its back, holding him steady. Many roads led to the Church, but the puppeteer chose the most obvious: the one leading up to the front entrance.

He observed the church&#39;s crumbling walls, noting signs of a prior fight. Perhaps he could find an alternative route upwards?</span></div></div></div></div></div>

A shot to the face. Gloria didn&#39;t even need to aim, as there wasn&#39;t much room to miss—Pyg was <em>that</em> big.

And also <em>that</em> tough, it seemed. The bullet struck the creature&#39;s skin but merely bounced off, leaving no visible mark. Pyg didn&#39;t even flinch, but the stunt had undoubtedly captured its attention, even as it crashed through the white flame walls.

Pyg landed on hard earth, only to find it empty. Gloria had already moved away, drawing fire with her guns while making a tactical retreat. Shards of ice clung to Pyg&#39;s body, but it simply shook them off like a wet dog ridding itself of rain droplets.

Gloria&#39;s intuition had proven correct: conventional bullets and purely defensive maneuvers wouldn&#39;t be enough to penetrate Pyg&#39;s defenses. She would either have to draw its attention away long enough for her Servant to finish off his opponent...or take care of the creature herself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134574221973016636 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134574221973016636><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 2:52 PM">2:52 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was a quick, delicate movement, the sign that Takeru had already made up their mind hours ago. Taking care of Gloria was a luxury he could not afford, so he deflected the bullet right back at the gravestone.

<em>thwick!</em>

Of course, the Archer was no longer there.

<em>&lt;Caster. Hmm.&gt;</em> Bill pondered Lachlan&#39;s reply while moving to further cover. He did remember Berserker&#39;s odd form, the one where they called themselves a &#39;Caster&#39;. Probably just a lie to confuse them, and even if it wasn&#39;t, they didn&#39;t exactly feel like the type of threat a Caster would normally bring to the table.

<em>&lt;Could be? The dragon didn&#39;t seem like a mage, anyway.&gt;</em> He replied, still preferring to use telepathy. <em>&lt;And stop joking around, will ya? Ya did this last time and then it all went to shit...&gt;</em> Bill grumbled. <em>&lt;All yer good for is playing decoy anyway, so be as obnoxious as ya wanna be. Just not to me!&gt;</em>

Lachlan would find that insulting, if it weren&#39;t apparent that Bill was only scolding his Master because he couldn&#39;t deal with these types of jabs in the middle of combat. Guess that was one weakness to take note of. Part of him wished he had learned this sooner. Even a thug like Archer could look cute when they were embarrassed.

<em>&lt;Ooooh. I get ya now.&gt;</em> Bill rested under a tree&#39;s shade, feeling like a fool as he realized Lachlan&#39;s reluctance to use telepathy. <em>&lt;Got it. No talking about what happens under yer sheets. I&#39;ll take it to me grave.&gt;</em> He said, a giggle barely escaping his lips. He was about to comment on the unknown Servant&#39;s possible whereabouts, until he saw Saber initiate their approach. Takeru was shuffling towards the gravestones, no doubt looking for Archer.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134585800806387722 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134585800806387722><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 3:38 PM">3:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;I dunno, but I can&#39;t definitely sense a Saber on my trail.&gt;</em> Archer grumbled. He wasn&#39;t looking forward to fighting another Knight class Servant, especially one as sturdy as the &#39;strongest&#39; class. He thought it was just hearsay at first, but after seeing the wound on Saber&#39;s wrist, he started to reconsider.

<em>&lt;That bullet should have chopped his wrist right off. Don&#39;t matter if he&#39;s a Servant or not.&gt;</em> He bit his lip. <em>&lt;I ain&#39;t no mage, so it can&#39;t be Magic Resistance. What else kinda skills does a Servant have to protect themselves anyway?!&gt;</em> He would have kept prodding his Master, had he not heard Pyg&#39;s cries and Gloria&#39;s gunshots.

<em>&lt;Well, ya got yer hands full so...Nevermind.&gt;</em> Bill said, much to Lachlan&#39;s frustration, for it implied that his Master could not multitask. Instead, the Archer made the first move, taking note of Saber&#39;s position. They were on higher ground, meaning that cover only had limited applications as a hiding spot.

Good thing he had reloaded.

<em>CRACK!</em>

A second and a half. It took a second for a bullet to hit the gravestone and shatter it into pieces, causing the projectile to ricochet. Then half a second for it to reach Takeru&#39;s neck, just inches away from perforating it.

To a human, that could never be perceived. To a Saber, that felt painfully slow.

<em>BANG!</em>

So slow that Takeru could see another bullet trail behind that one. And another one.

<em>BANG!</em>

And another one.

<em>BANG!</em>

And another.

It was a conga line of bullets, fired all at once, but aiming at different spots. Because of this, they all ricocheted towards different locations, only to all converge at the same spot. Bill&#39;s calculations were trying to answer the age old question:</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134585842686496919 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134585842686496919><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 3:39 PM">3:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
What happened when a bullet hit <em>another bullet?</em>

Normal science thought this impossible. For Bill, this was just another Tuesday. He already knew what happened when a bullet followed another bullet.

It turned into a <em>spear.</em> The bullet pushing the other forward, transferring all the force and mana behind it to its successor. This kept escalating until the first bullet now had the penetrative force of six-times-six-times-

<strong>A WHOLE LOTTA PAIN.</strong>

Takeru had a quarter of a second to decide between deflecting or dodging. Neither seemed appeasing. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The accusation of theft seemed to have flown right over the culprit&#39;s head. &#39;The Grail waits for no clown, but we can still have tea in between. With extra sugar and spice, should you prefer a bold flavor that&#39;s heavy on the tongue.&#39;

Rider stuck out their own tongue, mischief written all over their features. &#39;But you think too <em>little</em> of me. Why wouldn&#39;t I be ready to pay? Now that all the chess pieces have assembled on the playing field...didn&#39;t you all come here, hoping to be blessed by the overseer of this game?&#39;

Giggling, Rider took a seat across from Triboulet, tea cup clinking on the table as they set it down, pinky raised. &#39;This is, what, the second time in two weeks?&#39; 

Chaos erupted outside the church, filled with gunshots and roars. The garden alone stood like an oasis, a little fish bowl secluded from the turmoil all around. Just then, the buzzing in Assassin&#39;s head amplified, just as it had for Saber, Archer, their Masters, the puppets...Illyn. 

<em><strong>&lt;Bon voyage,&gt;</strong></em> the Demon smiled, thoughts projecting into the nearby participants. <em><strong>&lt;Consider this my payment to you for making it this far.&gt;</strong></em>

The Masters&#39; heads split open.

Not physically, no, but the pain was beyond relief, as if countless nails were being hammered into their brains, stretching them beyond their limits. But just as quickly as it had begun, the agony subsided, and what was left behind was nothing but a wealth of information...

...information about the state of the Holy Grail War.

There would be no more guessing games. The identities of each and every Master and Servant had been laid bare, their <strong>names, classes, and appearances</strong> beamed directly into each Master&#39;s mind. And it seemed that should they venture further, there was even more wisdom to be gained from this unexpected gift...should they dare to take the risk.

&quot;Second time?&quot;

Triboulet spun on her heel and looked back at him, and just as he gave her a child-like smile, she gave him the same venom-filled glare that he got the last time they met.  There were no love, nor cookies, to be shared between them.  This was <em>Ruler.</em>  The voice, and the sudden electric hum in her head, left no doubt.  He had gained some inches in the intervening time, hadn&#39;t he?  It would be a shame if something happened to bring him back down.

If he was here and already interfering, the worry crept into her paranoiac mind that he couldn&#39;t be trusted as an impartial observer - even more than before.

She gripped tight on her scepter, but the continued violence elsewhere demanded her attention much more.  There was going to be much had between them, but it could wait.  But when it came...it was good that he didn&#39;t hide in the shell of a child anymore.  No guilt.

Bidding adieu, Triboulet grinned, and waved a hand at Rider.  &quot;The third time, Ruler, will be the occasion that I kick you <em>so hard in the balls</em> you&#39;ll fly back to whatever awful corner of space you came from.  I hope that tea burns your tongue~&quot;

A friendly farewell dispensed, it would be time for the festivities to really begin.  She returned to the rooftops...

&quot;Ha.&quot;

&quot;<strong>Hahaha...</strong>&quot;

&quot;<strong>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!</strong>&quot; Illyn&#39;s laugh echoed across the courtyard as he looked over at Rider, then Assassin. Did she know? Or perhaps this was simply a moment where history threatened to rhyme.

&quot;That&#39;s not needed. We&#39;ve already won it. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here. It was foretold by the atomic direction of the universe. That thing that we call <strong>fate</strong>.&quot;

This battle between Heroic Spirits would be quite spectacular. A war with no hidden tricks. There would only be one winner and two losers, and the one to bestow the Holy Grail... 

Illyn looked at his Servant with a faint smile.

...<strong>would be its Ruler.</strong> It was foretold and calculated.

&quot;Poisoning tea? How droll and boring. As if I could concoct something that would do anything more than give her a mild stomachache. &quot; Illyn watched as Assassin fled to begin the fight. He shuffled awkwardly for a moment. &quot;I&#39;m not loathsome.&quot; He murmured. 

He ran his mind through the calculations of this battle. So many variables. So many unpredictable scenarios. Despite that, they all led to one conclusion:

<strong>Ruler&#39;s plan.</strong></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135830564449030175 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135830564449030175><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 1, 2023 2:05 AM">2:05 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Every scientist wished they could eliminate meaningless scenarios and simply &#39;choose&#39; the one they wanted.

And his Noble Phantasm... The ability to grant information. For most, it was a splitting headache. For Illyn, it was made easier to carry thanks to a divided mind, each capable of processing the influx of information. Not only could he intake it, he could make <strong>sense</strong> of it.

&quot;I wonder...&quot; Illyn said as he watched the battle. &quot;If you had told them nothing about the identities of their foes, would it change the result? I cannot help but wonder if your Noble Phantasm simply allows you to choose a future, and influence our path towards it. If that&#39;s the case, then it&#39;s not fate at all. It&#39;s godhood.&quot;

&quot;<strong>What do you think, Rider?</strong>&quot;

Standing up, Illyn cracked his neck. &quot;Come. Let&#39;s make the final preparations. Is the vessel ready?&quot;

We have not taken a divergent path, but rather a shortcut. By granting them the peace of mind that comes with this knowledge, I mitigate the risk of undesirable expenditures during the eventual cleanup.&#39;

Of course, the difference in the amount of mana required to deal with a <em>partially</em> exhausted Servant versus a <em>completely</em> exhausted one was inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. With the Grail so close within their grasps, that differences amounted to a mere drop in the ocean of energy the Grail could provide. But why squander that perfectly good droplet if the waste could be avoided in the first place?

&#39;Godhood is used to explain things that cannot be reasoned with. My abilities, on the other hand, have well-defined rules and methods. They&#39;re not cheats, as each action exacts a clear cost.&#39;

Rider gestured for Illyn to take Assassin&#39;s seat, inviting their Master to immerse themselves in the cacophony of screeches, shouts, explosions, and earth-shattering pounding currently unfolding beyond the garden&#39;s boundaries. The fact that the church building—compromised roof and all—had managed to withstand this onslaught seemed almost miraculous: perhaps if God really existed, then this would be the perfect example of their inexplicable benevolence.

The mysteries surrounding Rider, on the other hand, was anything but inexplicable.

A singular exception existed for this knowledge-granting Noble Phantasm; Rider was that exception. Forever a Demon outside the box, they were granted immunity from their own ability: they could not benefit from its effects, nor could anyone hope to gain any insights about them...without consulting existing records or interrogating them directly.

The good news, was that Rider seemed rather cooperative and open to letting out their secrets.

&#39;My first Noble Phantasm grants you knowledge,&#39; the petite Servant deftly twirled their cup on the table. &#39;It makes your brain work overtime to process an extensive amount of information in a flash. It&#39;s a direct trade-off, between knowledge and sanity. In a sense, it allows you to <strong>learn your past.</strong>&#39;

Rider mimicked pulling back a bowstring with their hands, before pointing their finger towards a cluster of fruits hanging from a nearby tree.

&#39;My second Noble Phantasm locked on a foreseeable future event, then <em>accelerates</em> it by paying an equal cost in energy, instantaneously making that event a reality. It&#39;s a shortcut of sorts, like the nails I rusted away in our fight against the Saint. With this Noble Phantasm, I can <strong>seal your future.</strong>&#39;

&#39;My third Noble Phantasm...&#39; 

Rider plucked a fallen branch from the ground and dragged several lines in the dirt, each of them converging at one side and fanning out on the other.

&#39;A reasonable speculation, though a bit off the mark. My third Noble Phantasm isn&#39;t about <em>choosing</em> the right path. Rather, it provides me with the authority to manipulate every atom in this universe as I please. I can alter their positions, velocities, and trajectories; I can create new atoms and insert them as required. This isn&#39;t an act of choosing a future or erasing a past...in essence, it grants me the power to completely <strong>rewrite the present.</strong>&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s not a godly, but a <em>costly</em> endeavor,&#39; they mused, as their eyes involuntarily drifted to the buttery biscuit in Illyn&#39;s hand. &#39;The more energy I possess, the more atoms I can edit. However, with the amount of energy I can tap from the Grail, I can execute this &quot;miracle&quot; on an unprecedented scale...now <em>that</em>, Monsieur Mariston, will be a sight to behold.&#39;

Rider giggled as they took Illyn&#39;s hand. Golden spiritrons sparked, materializing into a swath of soft and delicate fabrics: an emerald gown, exquisitely sewn and draped gracefully in sumptuous folds of silk as they wrapped around Rider&#39;s body. Perched atop their head was a large, fluffy hat, its brim wide enough to accommodate a cascade of feathers and ribbons that made Illyn&#39;s nostrils tickle at the mere sight of it.

Rider offered a genteel bow, a well-mannered little lady so far removed from the barefoot, dirt-covered child moments ago. &#39;Let us make haste,&#39; they inclined their head towards an unassuming mound nestled at the garden&#39;s center. &#39;The Sister awaits our presence.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137478686141059284 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137478686141059284><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 3:14 PM">3:14 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The two figures traversed through the lowers and intricately carved lines of garden and summoning circle. Rider was as lighthearted as usual, while Illyn walked forward with a somber casualness.

This was just another ritual, after all.

The two stopped over the unassuming mound, and Illyn reached forward and removed the shroud, throwing it to the wind.

Sister Rosula&#39;s face stared back at them both, well preserved despite their recent attack on the Church. The shroud was a necessary precaution, given that all it would take was one delusional cowboy or an unamusing joke from the clown to botch the ritual.

&quot;In Japan, the vessel would&#39;ve been up to higher standards. Here, it is third-rate for a Holy Grail overflowing with far more energy than the one seen in Fuyuki. So many Servants swirling around in that cup, soon to runneth over.&quot;

Illyn looked at Rider, then at the corpse in front of them. He laughed. The contrast between the two was amusing. There was something more, though.

&quot;I said it jokingly before, but this war is already askew. I suppose that makes us most qualified to invoke the Holy Grail&#39;s operating procedures. That truly does make us the joint Overseers, doesn&#39;t it? I can&#39;t help but laugh at how amusing this is.&quot;

There was no need to feel bad for Rosula. 

She was, after all, only a vessel.

Taking a knee, Illyn gently touched the dirt beneath their feet and murmured a few calculations. Rider&#39;s calculations were essentially flawless, as expected from a being capable of showing the future, learning the past, and sealing the future towards a desired outcome.

Fracturing his mind into rooms, Illyn confirmed and referenced the circle with his own memory stores. He made a few minor tweaks—more out of pride than of necessity—then he stood and nodded to Ruler.

&quot;<strong>Begin</strong>.&quot; Illyn stepped back.</span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 5:24 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div></div>
