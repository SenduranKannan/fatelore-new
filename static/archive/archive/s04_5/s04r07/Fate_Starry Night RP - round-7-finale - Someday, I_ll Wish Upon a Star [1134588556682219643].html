This Saber was a violent and wild fighter in the right circumstances, but to have him get into a gunfight would end poorly.  Triboulet had repositioned away from her brief tea party with Rider and to the roof of the church, and the few seconds she had to decide a target were spent in thought.

Lachlan was there, and so, Bill must be as well.  The latter was a tall man, so she didn&#39;t have trouble spotting him from above, sticking out in the long-growing shadows of the evening.  This could be over just like that, though - from what she could see, the smarmy, noble-affected Master of Archer was open.  Atop some hideous creature, but unaware.

She wouldn&#39;t even need to step down to kill him, it&#39;d be as quick as a single knife shot through his collarbone and into his heart!  The boy had enough fun in this war, and the contract be damned, he was about...oh, yes.  The contract.  Her hand was steadied and a knife was placed in it, and her aim would&#39;ve hit true.  She was at the top of her game, and Lachlan wouldn&#39;t get more than the absolute human minimum in reaction time before his heart was pierced.  She did not throw it yet.

If she took this opportunity, then the contract wouldn&#39;t matter, would it?  Dead men can&#39;t complain.  Bill would simply depart with a little wound on his heart, nothing too bad.  But, at the same time...she had wasted <em>much</em> time trying to convince him of some cultural, intellectual superiority, and already conceded in certain ways...to give up <em>moral</em> superiority...

The few seconds she had stretched on for a bit, and now she was wasting time.  Invisible up there, she had no audience for the show of conflict that played through her stares, and the grit of her teeth, the biting of her lip.

...god, damn you, Cherokee Bill.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134588649594433586 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134588649594433586><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 3:50 PM">3:50 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>James received the signal - no sarcasm or overly long wind-up, just a shouted <em>GO, NOW!</em>

From the roof, there was a short rattle of tiles, and that was all the warning Archer got ahead of time.  A multicolored blur came down in front of him, putting its full force into the ornate grave marker in front of him - centuries old, it was a stone monolith that she had kicked with enough force to crack and crash down onto Bill&#39;s <em>stupid face.</em>

Lachlan had a slight extension on his life, but Bill wouldn&#39;t be so lucky.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

His teeth were gritted tightly against each other that he would have lost his tongue if it was caught in the crossfire. He was sure a few chips were broken off from the pressure alone but he was in no position to check. He fell to his knees, supported solely by a wall, but, despite all of that, he <em>did</em> receive an important piece of information.

<em>&#39;<strong>Three pairs left including us</strong>. This is all that&#39;s left, Tri. No need to fear another joining in the middle of this fight.&#39;</em> 

That was all the information he was going to dive for. He knew the ramifications if he did dive deeper into that ocean of knowledge. It was the last thing he was eager to relive, after all. 

Once he regained a steady balance, the signal was sent out: <em><strong>GO, NOW</strong></em>

<em>&#39;<strong>Right!</strong>&#39;</em>

There, even with the pains in his muscles crying out at him for doing so, James broke into a sprint towards his target. Sure, the brat had the help of two of his puppets unlike last time, but this time was different; he had Triboulet backing him up. With that knowledge in mind, James felt a renewed confidence in himself towards the outcome of this fight.

&quot;Hey, kid! Got a height complex or something?!&quot; James screamed out while tossing a bright red Silver Nail his way as he sat on top of Leapfrog. He hated the thought of using one of his very few Silver Nails like this. There wasn&#39;t any chance he would get close enough to stab him with it, though, yet, so this was his next best chance. He had still three left. He just hoped that it wouldn&#39;t come to bite him in the ass later.

He knew that Triboulet didn&#39;t need any help with maintaining her comedy act to keep her trump card active, but would he be able to say that he learned anything from her if he didn&#39;t at least pitch in somewhat with the play she so graciously put on for everyone? Not after being scolded at death&#39;s door, of course!</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134628074667909210 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134628074667909210><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, July 28, 2023 6:26 PM">6:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He swaps his passive strategy for an aggressive one.

There you are. Four shots. They are all converging into one spot. Mmm, there’s a feeling that something similar has happened before. Saber makes a small adjustment, he weaves to the side and the bullets barely graze the fabric of his clothes. The time is now.

In the blink of an eye, as soon as the bullets shot past him, he snapped onto the source of the last shot. He begins his pursuit with the speed of a storm. Any disturbances, he will rush to inspect it, like a blind rabid animal. He can’t afford to give Archer any time to settle, there shall be no rest for the wicked; he’ll be running for as long as he fires his gun.

 ”I can smell you from here, Archer!”

He breaks a couple of headstones in his search, less cover for the gunslinger and more sight for the swordsman. For how long can Archer run from him? He can do this all day, at that point, neither he nor Archer can win the war.

Though…

There is something that Saber is careful about and very aware of.

If he were to receive another bullet, how many more can he shrug off before it becomes hard to ignore? As of now, the wound on his wrist is nothing to him anymore but it is something to everyone else. Ultimately, his concern lies in closing the distance as not doing so would be enabling the enemy.

Some sort of tense feeling that clawed at the heart and dulled the mind, making the wind feel dry and the garden look lifeless. Bill was in a <em>graveyard</em>, after all, surrounded by tombstones of past priests and nuns, but that wasn&#39;t related to what he was feeling.

He could sense it through his link with Lachlan&#39;s mind. His Master&#39;s mind seemed heavy, as if they had much to think about. He wondered why, but didn&#39;t have the luxury to prod.

After all, Saber had just showcased why he was worthy of the title of &#39;strongest Servant class.&#39; The elaborate spear of bullets had been dodged, with the warrior dodging the first four bullets and the two that came right behind it. They then plummeted to the graveyard and started to skulk around tombstones, slashing at them blindly in an effort to flush Archer out.
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-ansi">[2;31m1.5 seconds[0m</code>
Give Takeru enough time and with his speed, finding Archer would be child&#39;s play. There were only so many trees and tombs that one could use as a resting place. 
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-ansi">[2;31m1.8 seconds[0m</code>
Bill was fully aware of that.

&quot;Then what should I call ya? Fido?&quot; Archer joked, poking his head from the back of his tree, his coat flapping in the wind as he revealed himself to his opponent. A suicidal move.

&quot;Hmmm, nah.&quot; He stroked his chin, then shook his head. &quot;That name got taken a while ago, I&#39;m afraid. A shame I couldn&#39;t put down that bastard of a Lancer.&quot; He leaned forward, placing his boot on a nearby grave and resting on it. Bill exuded confidence.
<code class="chatlog__markdown-pre chatlog__markdown-pre--multiline language-ansi">[2;31m2.6 seconds[0m</code>
&quot;But hey, at least I get a Saber for me troubles!&quot; Bill laughed, taking out two pistols and holding them out, bandit style. It was his way of saying <em>&#39;Come at me!&#39;</em>

Takeru happily obliged, since getting close to Archer was his objective in the first place. Bill stood still as his opponent got closer, fingers pressed on their respective triggers. He would fire within range.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1134987187927122020 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1134987187927122020><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, July 29, 2023 6:13 PM">6:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&quot;Get closer, ya lil&#39; rat. Fly like a bee to honey. You&#39;ll never see my next move coming-&quot;</em>

<em>crack</em>
<em>rumble</em>

Then, a loud noise, followed by a large shadow surrounding Bill&#39;s figure. Archer looked up and widened his eyes, noticing a large tombstone that was ornate and flowery. Perfectly fitting for him.

Of course, he also caught a glimpse of a short, skinny finger hanging from the rooftops. One closer to Lachlan&#39;s side of the fight. That shit eating grin couldn&#39;t be missed.

<em>&lt;Why is the clown here?!?&gt;</em> Bill grumbled so much that his own frustrations crossed over to Lachlan&#39;s mind. Well, at least now both of them knew that Triboulet was hanging about.

Thinking fast, Bill immediately took a step back and let Saber come to him. Then, with barely a moment&#39;s notice, he spoke up:

<strong>&quot;Don&#39;t look up, samurai boy.&quot;</strong>

A trick? A joke? If Takeru were to look up, as his opponent had suggested, he would notice a tombstone...that was about to fall directly on both of them.

<em>BANG!</em>

And while Takeru was distracted, even if it was only a fraction of a millisecond, he would fire his load. Two bullets were headed for Takeru&#39;s knees, most likely to cripple him and his speed. The Saber could easily jump, but the tombstone was still an issue: That despicable Archer wasn&#39;t moving at all; they would rather get hit by the grave than move out of the way and let Saber get an easier hit on them.

Bill smiled, observing Takeru&#39;s reactions. He knew bits and pieces of Saber&#39;s abilities based on their previous encounter, but Saber didn&#39;t know <em>him.</em> After all, they had fought in an enclosed sewer the last time. Not an open area like a back garden.

It may appear that the enemy has gone mad and revealed himself to him. Fido, huh. A dog’s name, quite fitting for Saber at the very moment.

The cowboy’s insane, he laughs in the face of great peril. He holds his guns with a conceited attitude, cocky one he is. Saber gladly accepts his invitation and hastens his approach, committing to it.

Don’t look up? What happens if…

?!

As if the appearance of a sudden hard shade didn’t give it away, there is something falling to crush the both of them. Did Archer plan on crushing him to death? Can’t be, he’s going to be as flat as a pancake too.

!!!

Hearing two shots, Saber looked back down to see Archer capitalizing on the distraction. As he is already committing his approach, he could only do what he was going to do to begin with.

His concentration on the fight makes his blade a magnet to threats, swiping away the bullets like flies on the food. He closes the distance and delivers a donkey kick to Archer’s gut, sending him flying. And then, it happened.

It seems that Saber has perished. Buried by a grave airdrop. Strangely, for someone who is supposedly dead, his aura is still awfully strong…

 ”Right here.”

Lifting the weight of the stone monolith, he moves it off himself with little effort. Since the beginning of the end, he had repeatedly shown his great strength, proving his worth to be in the Saber class.

Early into the war, he hasn’t been able to exercise his might as a warrior until now. It was not because he was weak, but because he did not want to lose the very person he fights for. ▶</span></div></div></div></div></div>

 ”Any name to remember you by, Archer? Or would you rather I take your head as a trophy instead?”

He twirls his blade around his fingers with the hand that Archer had shot earlier. The wound is still present though he treats it as if it isn’t there. He is taunting the cowboy, clearly telling him that he’s going to need more than that to have a chance. 

 ”I suppose it’s rude to ask without introducing myself first.”

Saber breaks into a familiar stance, smoothly transitioning from flashy sword tricks into a guard. Plant the left foot forwards, shuffle the right foot to the back, pose the blade over the head. Both hands on the hilt, the right by the guard, the left by the pommel. He’s ready.

There was only one issue that could be had with this regal appearance.

The cracked gravestone ended up landing short of Bill, but its defacer did not.  Behind it, and then grasping ahold of the stone cross at its peak like an especially sacrosanct gymnastics bar, came Triboulet!  She spun about, utilizing the distraction of Saber and throwing her legs around Bill&#39;s neck.  Small as they were and weak as she was, she was still able to put enough crushing force into them that she could potentially snap Bill&#39;s neck, just like that!  A fine return to form considering their previous intimacies.

She hung upside down like an especially colorful scarf trailing behind him, keeping a tight hold as he flailed to dislodge her, and kept her head out of the way so that she may not be <em>immediately</em> silenced via headshot.

Now that she had made her own entrance, Triboulet finally explained her issues vis-&#224;-vis Takeru&#39;s introduction as she attacked: &quot;TAKERU, INTRODUCE YOURSELF LATER, YOU RUNT!  Kill this bastard, post-haste!&quot;

Once again she tried to go for the legs, brandishing two knives that she thrust backwards into Bill&#39;s cloak, and the backside of his knees.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It rose from every pore on his body, as if thousands of snakes were crawling in his bloodstreams and tearing him apart from within. Lachlan doubled over. He clutched his head and screamed, as his skin flushed pink under the strain of Rider&#39;s Noble Phantasm. The mysterious voice continued to ring in his head, pushing him to the brink of despair as he buckled over, looking for help from anyone, <em>anything</em>—

And then he saw it.

Names, faces, and words, jumbled together yet making perfect sense, as absurd and crazy and exhilarating and cruel and overwhelming and addictive and he simply absorbed it all, like a parched sponge soaking up water, like scorched sand finally quenching its thirst. In an instant, he knew.

His body shivered in cold sweat from what felt like an eternity of torture, but as quickly as it started, it was over. In the meantime, a vortex of information about the War drowned his brain, information that the mysterious voice had deigned to share—or rather, dumped onto him against his will.

&#39;You...&#39; The puppeteer staggered to his feet. <strong>&#39;Get the fuck out of my head!&#39;</strong>

He needn&#39;t have yelled. Yet, the physical outburst centered him, and he quickly found his own voice back.

<em>&lt;I know,&gt;</em> Lachlan shakily replied to the cowboy. <em>&lt;<strong>I know.</strong> I don&#39;t know what that Ruler—or should I say, Rider—is planning, but he just told me everything.&gt;</em>

He quickly relayed the intel to Bill. It seemed that they had quite the vendetta party going on here; Assassin, Saber, and their Masters were the only ones remaining—the only ones he couldn&#39;t finish off the first time round. What a cruel twist of fate.

</div></div>
Lachlan whirled around at the sound of James&#39; voice. He&#39;d recognize it anywhere now, much to his own chagrin. He had half expected the man to be lurking nearby, but with so many Servants in close vicinity and Rider&#39;s untimely distraction, James hadn&#39;t even crossed his mind until he made his presence known. 

And what a greeting it was. Despite Lachlan&#39;s bolstered sight having picked up the red glimmer of James&#39; heated Nail, Lachlan knew his reflexes wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up.

<em><strong>fwip</strong></em>

He didn&#39;t need to, however.

The Dancer intervened, its sharp, pale claw stopping mere inches from its owner&#39;s face, which surely would have born an extra hole had James&#39; attack gone through. The scorching Nail was clutched tightly in the puppet&#39;s hand, where the smell of burning flesh wafted from where it had snatched the giant needle out of the air.

&#39;Fancy seeing you here,&#39; Lachlan feigned surprise, though he had an inkling that neither of them were surprised to see each other. Rider had unfortunately taken out any element of surprise in this brief warfare.

But even so, it wasn&#39;t as if Lachlan <em>needed</em> to surprise his opponent. James might have had to rely on it to gain an upper hand, but him?

He sighed. &#39;That was poorly planned. Going in alone to fight a puppet master is possibly the worst decision you could&#39;ve made in your entire life. There is more than one way to gain a height advantage,&#39; he called out to the older Magus. &#39;For example, I could always have <em>you</em> kneeling instead. Leapfrog?&#39;

In fact, he felt insulted that Assassin had even thought it would work! What did she think he was made of, molasses?!

Saber made him focus again, by kicking him in the stomach and sending him flying. <em>There&#39;s</em> the strength of a Knight class Servant. Seemed like the apple didn&#39;t fall far off from the tree if you <em>shook</em> the tree enough.

&quot;Guh.&quot; Bill grunted, landing on another tombstone, but not worse for wear. His hands were still attached to his guns, and so long as they were, he could-

A shadow loomed over him. The unfriendly kind. Soon, two lithe thighs were wrapped around his neck, a woman snaking through his body like the masterful contortionist they were. His body, heavy. His limbs, limited. The only thing left were his eyes, that caught a glimpse of his assailant&#39;s face before they took refuge on his back.

&quot;Ya little shit.&quot; The cowboy grumbled. &quot;Can&#39;t keep yer hands off me, can you? Should have called me to bed, then.&quot; He laughed like a hyena, most likely filling Triboulet&#39;s mind with repulsive chills. No wonder she immediately called for his execution, moaning for Takeru to finish Archer off. Once she caught Saber slacking, she decided to take matters into her own hands.

The only warning Bill got was a shift in balance, the sign that Assassin was pulling back with her upper torso in order to swing at something below, like a pendulum&#39;s arc. He already knew how much she loved those thick legs of his, based on their last encounter. Grabbing at his back was pointless.

Instead, he simply jumped, raising his legs while he did so. Triboulet&#39;s arms swung underneath, passing through his coat and missing his legs completely. After all, they were now above her.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135666206595108965 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135666206595108965><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 3:12 PM">3:12 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>STOMP!</em>

And instead, his boots collided with the ground, bringing Assassin&#39;s wrists to the muddy dirt as well. She felt her bones crack, but her grip remained solid. If this was all it took for her to fail her mission, then she really was a piss poor Assassin.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised ya even drive, Saber. Don&#39;t think someone as half assed as youse could drive a horse, let alone a car.&quot; Bill scoffed, finding Takeru&#39;s threats beneath his notice. He then turned around, letting Takeru get a good look at Assassin, who was still hanging on Bill&#39;s back.

&quot;Ya wanna stab me? Go through her first. She likes it rough.&quot; Archer howled, using Triboulet as a shield of sorts. This would either force her to get off, continue her assault (and risk getting punished again) or allow Saber to strike both of them down.

&quot;Ya know, Tribble,&quot; There goes that name again. Yet another reason to kill him. &quot;I&#39;m kinda glad yer still alive.&quot; That was even more sickening. Why was he cozying up to her for-

&quot;Yer my racehorse. If ya live, then my Master is sorted.&quot; There it was. She could tell from his grin (if she could see it) that he saw her as nothing more than a tool to his ends. A bullet in the chamber. He was as shameless as the most vile of kings, the only saving grace being his integrity. She wouldn&#39;t be here after all if he hadn&#39;t kept up his end of the bargain.

But deals were always made to be altered. Especially when they were no longer needed. Surely Bill knew that? Or was he that much of a fool?

&quot;Since yer such a smart ass though,&quot; Bill laughed, whispering loud enough for only Assassin to hear. This was for Tribble only, it seemed. <strong>&quot;dontcha think ya made a mistake?&quot;</strong>

They were shot at the perfect speed and distance to coalesce together into a spear of gunpowder, shell casings and mana gluing them all together. An impossible projectile that could only be made by a Heroic Spirit that had mastered the modern art of gun slinging.

Saber had dodged by a hair&#39;s breadth, exerting their maximum speed. By all means, the bullets should have disappeared, lost momentum, or collided with an object and lost their power. But there was no such thing as a wasted bullet to Cherokee Bill, especially if his opponents dared to look away. A bullet that you left behind could be as lethal as a bullet headed straight for your eyes.

His brain was that of a donkey&#39;s, but every pack mule had something that they were good at. In Bill&#39;s case, his brain constantly did complex, mindboggling calculations whenever he held a pistol in hand, all led by a simple piece of code in his mind:

<em>Kill X amount of people with Y amount of bullets. (Where X&gt;Y)</em>

Because of that logic, even his more bestial and instinctual actions belonged to those of a genius. If anything, these calculations were simply part of his instincts. His eyes didn&#39;t look at walls; they looked at weak locations where bullets could pass through. He didn&#39;t look at tiles as tiles, more so spots to ricochet from. He didn&#39;t see people as much as targets.

That brutal worldview was the reason he had survived so long. He would prove it to Triboulet in this instant.

He triangulated the exact spot his bullets would land in case Takeru dodged. And once he did, he already had a feeling for how long it would take for those bullets to come back.

<em>ZING!</em>

They had collided with the church&#39;s bell tower, landing on a section of stone wall that graciously let them bounce back towards the church&#39;s main building.

And another wall.

And another.

And another.

<em>ZING! ZING! ZING!</em>

A symphony of ricochets was occurring, the bullets only being kept intact by the Archer&#39;s mana. They played a sick game of pinball, crossing the distance and returning back to where they once were.

8 seconds. Just like Bill had calculated.

&quot;Ya wanna see Saber get turned into swiss cheese?&quot; Bill giggled, making sure Triboulet could look at Takeru from a distance. She then saw little twinkles in the sky, six bullets raining down on Saber as if they had fallen from the sky. They were headed for his upper torso, wide enough to force him to protect both his left and right shoulders.

Then, without even turning around, Bill whipped out his two pistols and held them upside down, having the tip face his opponent while still giving Triboulet a good view of the scene.

<em>BANG! BANG! BANG!</em>

Twelve more bullets total, one aimed at each vital body part, then the rest applied to every vital organ. He didn&#39;t even need to look to shoot; he had already memorized Takeru&#39;s height, measurements and position. He had shot down plenty of men his size before.

It would be tough for Saber to defend himself from all of that and remain unharmed.

&quot;Ya get me now?&quot; Bill whispered, keeping the conversation limited to him and Assassin. <strong>&quot;If ya just joined us, we could take down Saber easily.&quot;</strong> He pointed out, a snake worming itself into Assassin&#39;s ear.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135666475168972861 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135666475168972861><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 3:13 PM">3:13 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<strong>&quot;I took down a dragon yesterday.&quot;</strong> He gloated, reloading his bullets in the meanwhile. &quot;Going from something like that to this is just child&#39;s play at this point. Ya feel me? I can&#39;t be bothered anymore.&quot; He sneered, looking down on his opponents. It was probably infuriating to hear, but scary at the same time. If the gunslinger had no issues taking down a dragon, what made a swordsman and a jester think that they had a chance?

&quot;But hey, yer choice. If ya don&#39;t answer, then I&#39;ll just havta kill ya too.&quot; The air changed, feeling dusty and rustic. The once verdant garden now felt arid and scorching hot. A tumbleweed rolled into view.

His Noble Phantasm was coming. Triboulet could decide whether to succumb to it or be part of it.

That amount of information was more than enough to warrant the trade of one of his dwindling supply of weapons. 

Fear and doubt hindered James at their first encounter. Feelings that were no longer present, thanks to Triboulet. The same wouldn&#39;t happen this time. Now he just needed to get close. The brat wasn&#39;t going to make it easy for him, though. 

&quot;Then it is rather fortunate that I didn&#39;t come alone now isn&#39;t it?&quot; A second Silver Nail was grabbed from behind him. The metal already heating up in his hand. &quot;You can try, kid, but I&#39;ll let you know now that you ain&#39;t walking out of here alive unlike last time.&quot; Even without staring into his eyes, the movements from his body showed the amount confidence he had against Lachlan. 

Two tall walls stood between James and Lachlan and yet he moved as if he already saw a path straight to the brat.

Just how could she help out her Master before then? James didn&#39;t know the answer either. All he could do was trust in her, as he should have done from the start.

James altered his course slightly so he was on a collision course with Leapfrog. There he crouched down and slid on the ground, kicking up dirt and grass, while allowing Leapfrog to close the rest of the distance for him. Then, with the Silver Nail held in a reverse grip, James placed his palm on the end of the Nail to provide it more driving force for the impact. To ensure it doesn&#39;t shatter either, a <strong>Reinforcement</strong> spell was placed on it.

From their first encounter, James learned plenty about these puppets of his. They required quite the level of control to use them properly. So, if that ability of control were to be messed with, it should be able to hinder the brat&#39;s control over it. Hence why James&#39; target was none other than <strong>the brain</strong> of this creature.

Takeru snapped back at Archer. Kill him now, you ask, Assassin? Strange that she didn’t kill him herself. With a position like that, Takeru thought she’d twist his head off his shoulders. While he could follow through with his threat, he wanted to honor the little alliance that was made. What a pain, both Masters are fighting their own battles anyways. So much for an alliance.

?

Familiar sounds reached his ears. Something he could recall back in the sewers. Sounds of something hitting stone with little gaps between each other. Without a doubt, this is that trick the Archer likes to use. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1135783902905118800 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1135783902905118800><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, July 31, 2023 10:59 PM">10:59 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Gee, what kind of bullets are they, rubber? How can they have enough power to keep ricocheting to a target but not enough to break whatever they hit along the way?

A barrage of bullets coming from nearly everywhere. He’s going to have to take a hit, but he doesn’t need to take all of them at once.

He lets the blade hang down. He quickly turns 180 degrees, flicking his wrist and swinging the sword to cover 270 degrees around him. A strong gale is released, effectively turning bullets into mere foam darts. A familiar ability that he’d used before.

Unfortunately, the startup of the motion allowed some shots to strike him. Opening old wounds while making a couple of new ones. Just a flesh wound, huh, Takeru? He stands with his clothes stained in his own blood. Checking himself, his hand is covered in a nasty red.

 ”You hit like a girl, Archer. Perhaps you’re having a little girl talk with the funny one, hm?”

He wipes the blood off his hands with his clothes, now they’re really messy. That’s the least of his concerns though, back to beating someone up even if it means roughing up another along the way. He wonders if Assassin would do the same given the chance, though he won’t be surprised if that’s the case.

He steps back a couple of paces before breaking into a dash. He stops within distance before thrusting his sword at the two, planning to pierce through the both of them like barbecue. Assassin better hop off now unless she wants Takeru to kill her too.

Triboulet must&#39;ve thought so, as she was caught admiring the amount of pain that Bill&#39;s stomp had brought.  Not incapacitated, and she couldn&#39;t feel any bones broken (dislocated, perhaps...), but just a man&#39;s boot being brought down on her caused that much.

One hand&#39;s knife was purposefully discarded.  Through grit teeth, she called out to Takeru: &quot;Ram right through me!  If I were to die from a weak thing such as yourself, that would be a terrible climax!&quot;

The Saber and his plans were secondary to her, though.  As he waved his sword and called forth the wind in a greater display of power than she&#39;d ever have, Triboulet could only focus on Cherokee Bill.  The rat...even with this being, undoubtedly, their final concentration, she was just amusement and a contract to boot, huh?  She had no point in giving him a smile, hanging as she was, so she just called out sweetly, trying to raise her voice above the ongoing racket of ricochets.

&quot;The only mistake I&#39;ve made was letting a man such as thee...<em>steal my heart.&quot;</em>

GASP!  Unthinkable!  A confession of love, right here, in a graveyard right after she had just tried to cut the tendons of that selfsame man she admired?  If I were one Bill here, I&#39;d fall head over heels in more ways than one.

&quot;Think, Bill!  Whence I fell to thee in combat before, would a <em>true</em> Servant go out like such a weak little fucker?  I barely put up a fight!  Nay, &#39;twas the feeling in my steel&#39;d heart that gave me pause afore I drove my knife home.  &#39;tis not a question of whether you and I shall be joined in arms at war...&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136057661553647707 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136057661553647707><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 1, 2023 5:07 PM">5:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A flutter came to her already lyrical voice.  &quot;...but whether we shall be joined in <em>love.</em>  Dost thou hold thineself true to these most treasur&#39;d, locked-apart feelings, <em>William?&quot;</em>

Golly.  Would Bill admit his own, undoubtedly strong, love for her?  Would they walk away from this war, living their lives in the new world for as long as they can keep their Masters on leashes as mana batteries?  If Bill was a giant, huge, absolutely spastic empty-headed shitforbrains dumbass, perhaps he would indeed.  If he thought for a split-second about the timing of her confession and kept his dick in his pants, then maybe he&#39;d realize her duplicity.  But, hey, love makes you all kinds of confused~

With all of that laid out, lovers united, Triboulet finally unhooked herself from the man and fell into a perfect handstand (only exacerbating her pain, but what else is new).  &quot;I accept, <em>mon ch&#233;ri tr&#232;s poilu.</em>&quot;  A pet name, given as Takeru charged...just as he raised his sword to run the two bethrothed through, she hurriedly added,  &quot;As your first gift to me, godealwithSaberbyyourselfIbelieveinyoubye~&quot;

And thusly, her exit, stage left, was taken.  The distraction, whether it was genuine response from Archer or complete befuddlement, loud guffaws of disbelief or even worse catcalls thrown her way, was secondary.  What she needed at that moment was a brief window to get the hell away from him, to her Master, and not get grapeshotted like Saber was about to do.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136057722916311101 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136057722916311101><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 1, 2023 5:07 PM">5:07 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>All her self-assured kindness was a feint, given way to pragmatism.  If Bill and Takeru went at it for a whole 30 seconds, what does it matter to her?  Unless Takeru&#39;s going to die on the spot, they were only wearing themselves down!  A quick reset of her own battlefield was needed, and thus was the comedic exit, <strong>[Sortie, C&#244;t&#233; Cour]</strong>, taken.  And quite an exit it was; she managed to cross the field at even greater speed than before, her unworthy skill propelling her to a new side of the fight before Bill could even hear the crack of air from her departure.

The puppet and its blade found itself an equally well-trained dancing partner suddenly manifesting in front of it.  The Dancer towered over the much shorter Assassin, but even so, the latter&#39;s strength was a good match and more.  Triboulet pushed the claw that reached for James aside, and with another furnished knife, reached upward to shove into the thing&#39;s distorted torso.  There was something meaty in its chest; it seemed as if it was alive, somehow...

Her head rolled back and toward Lachlan: &quot;Hello!  Did Bill leave a good impression of me after we last met?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

For a man approaching his forties, James reacted surprisingly quickly. Not with the grace of a ballerina or the power of a football player, but his legs carried him far. He didn&#39;t attempt to outrun Leapfrog; instead, he moved towards it, as if willing to advance his own demise. 

But death wouldn&#39;t catch him just yet, for he wasn&#39;t alone. 

Lachlan barely registered Assassin&#39;s advance. Only when she had thrust her knife into the Dancer&#39;s torso in perfect unison with her Master, did the puppeteer realize that Bill had somehow lost one of his targets. Two streaks of blood spurted out of the puppets, one pure red, the other mixed with icky brain matter than ruined James&#39; perfectly good hair and shirt.

It was a one-two punch, a combo attack. The timing could not be more perfect, with two puppets felled in the blink of an eye. What was a puppeteer without his puppets? James and the Triboulet were just about to find out...

&#39;That depends on your performance,&#39; Lachlan&#39;s hand twitched as it started inching toward the inside of his coat—a risky move, considering how close Assassin was. &#39;Bill has told me a great many things about you, but I&#39;m not buying anything without seeing it with my own eyes. So, what role are you playing in this cramped stage today?&#39;

He was calm. Way too calm. Perhaps that calmness was only a fa&#231;ade, and Lachlan turned out to be a better actor than one would give him credit for. Or perhaps—

<em>Wrong.</em> 

Something felt terribly wrong. Assassin&#39;s hand encountered firm, pulsating flesh as she dug into the Dancer&#39;s chest cavity, but where the heart was supposed to be...it was just a gnarly lump of flesh. The heart had to be beating somewhere, she could almost feel it through the puppet&#39;s flesh, through the blood pumping through its distinctively human blood vessels, but it wasn&#39;t where it should be. If only she could explored further...

It was a futile effort, surely, but then again, the Dancer had been rigged to place the safety of its owner above its own needs. It used its body as a shield, while its elongated arms whipped back, claws lashing at the Court Jester&#39;s back in one seemingly painful hug. 

Meanwhile, James was having the experience of a lifetime. 

No, this had nothing to do with his ruined outfit, or the fact that his ears were currently being assaulted by Leapfrog&#39;s high-pitched screeches. His Nail had driven itself cleanly into Leapfrog&#39;s brain, but it seemed that the arachnoid puppet still had much life left in its body.

Did melting the brain not cause it to shut down immediately? Or was it reacting on pure instinct right now? And most importantly...what did an arachnoid do when it was in pain?

Leapfrog collapsed on top of James. Then it started to convulse violently.

Eight legs twitched and convulsed, wrapping around the human under its belly like a giant cocoon as Leapfrog rolled on the ground in pure agony. There were no sharp claws digging into James&#39; flesh, but the sheer weight of the puppet—easily several times his own—threatened to crush him if he didn&#39;t think of something quick!

<em>&lt;I think your clown friend has just decided to throw the game,&gt;</em> Lachlan observed, <em>&lt;And go after the puppet master instead. I suppose I should praise you for not blabbing about the anatomy of my Skinwalkers?&gt;</em> 

He pulled out his gun, and pointed it experimentally at Triboulet, then at the writhing Leapfrog and its burrito&#39;d friend. &#39;I don&#39;t usually dirty my own hands, but the situation calls for something new once in a while. I don&#39;t recall signing any agreement to go easy on <em>your</em> Master, for starters.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136397764402610226 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136397764402610226><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 2, 2023 3:39 PM">3:39 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Well, it might have worked a bit <em>too</em> well, actually. 

The Silver Nail was embedded deeply into the skull of Leapfrog. Any attempt to dislodge it made sure to send that across quite clearly. That was another Silver Nail lost already. Down to two more. The bright side? He was down to two more targets, at least.

The puppet already smelled horrible. The burning flesh brought it to a level that made James regret performing this maneuver immediately the moment it reached his nose. His whole face scrunched up in response to it. The last meal James had attempted to join the fight but was luckily forced back down before they could. Couldn&#39;t the brat at least wash his pets if he wanted to keep so many?!

The hygiene of meat puppets aside, there was a rising issue in front of him. Dancer had his Servant in a tight embrace. Sure, he had no doubt that she could break free. The kicker was that required <em>time</em>. Leapfrog also weighted far more than he anticipated. That or he couldn&#39;t have thought about that little factor in the heat of the moment before it was too late. The convulsions and screeches will forever haunt his dreams if he made it out of this alive. That wasn&#39;t even the worse part of it all. The worst part was the barrel of the gun he saw pointing his way.

The weight of Leapfrog kept placing strain on his body, especially his legs. The pressure had the older man gritting his teeth in pain. Any more pressure and a grisly crunch will soon follow. The failed attempts at James&#39; struggling to escape told that much. It at least provided him with a body shield of his own against that gun.

But how could he escape?

Sure, James will likely be crushed if he stopped struggling upon going to sleep. The same could be said for the puppet master as well. There were so many enemies around him. Bill can&#39;t keep tabs on all of them, could he? Can he risk continuing to make sure he has the shoot lined up if it meant that he fell asleep right now, not to mention with an Assassin so close by as well, or should he look away and hope for the best?

Whatever the puppet master decided to do, James had his own agenda to work on in the meantime. A hand was placed underneath Leapfrog before a spell was cast; <strong>Projection</strong>. If he could lodge something to prop Leapfrog up just high enough, he could wiggle his way out from under the puppet and to safety.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136627454837010544 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136627454837010544><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 6:51 AM">6:51 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Two thirds of his bullets had been deflected, but did it really matter? He had stopped relying on one shot one kill ever since his fight with Lancer. The realm of Servants was a ridiculous one, filled with tough and persistent bastards. Including him.

That confidence and familiarity made him rather talkative, as he attempted to sweet talk Triboulet into joining his side. They were both scrappy outcasts after all, not to mention the fact that she still acted and behaved like that annoying sister of his. He knew exactly how to push the buttons of someone like that.

Or did he?

Bill went silent, Triboulet filling in his stead as she peppered Saber and Archer with embarrassing and downright risqu&#233; statements. Stealing hearts? Joined in love? One might call it Shakespearean if it weren&#39;t so sudden. Proof that love was not only blind, but a bit mad, perhaps? The way Assassin was whispering and grinding closer to Bill&#39;s body made her look completely smitten. 

Bill felt conflicted. He loved attention and people singing his praises. So why did Triboulet&#39;s behavior make him feel sick to the stomach?

&quot;Didya hit yer head or something?&quot; He asked with a tone of disdain. &quot;Ya love me so much, then help me kill Saber-&quot; He proposed, only for Takeru to charge at them both while Triboulet detached herself from him. She then blew him a kiss, said something weird in French and hightailed it out of there. Archer had definitely fumbled.

<em>&quot;Sis...I&#39;m sorry for comparing ya to that...thing.&quot;</em> Was the only thought that crossed Bill&#39;s mind in that moment. Even Saber&#39;s threat looked like a distant memory as he shuddered at the things that Assassin had muttered. He preferred her drunk.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136754610808295524 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136754610808295524><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 3:16 PM">3:16 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Even worse was the thought he received afterwards. A downright irritated thought. <em>&lt;Listen, I&#39;m doing my best with two Servants on my tail like a pack of hungry dogs, alright?!&gt;</em> So much for having things under control. <em>&lt;Are ya telling me she forgot our agreement?! Call that bitch out! Tell her I&#39;ll kill her with my own two guns if she pulls something! I&#39;m coming there right n-&gt;</em>

<em>step step step</em>

<strong>&quot;Can ya give me a fucking moment?!&quot;</strong> Bill growled, facing Takeru head on and calling them out for striking him while he was (mentally) down. So much for the most honorable class! The wind responded in kind, blasting hot, dry air and dusty clouds in Saber&#39;s direction. Nothing to stop them, of course, but just enough to tell them that something had changed.

When Saber swept past another dust cloud, he would notice some differences in the world around him. The garden grass was partially covered in sand, the church&#39;s doors resembled those of an old style saloon, the windows were boarded up with old wood, the sky was arid and desolate. He felt like he had been sent back a few years, but not to his home country. Somewhere a lot more foreign.

So, this was Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm. A poor man&#39;s Reality Marble, one so pathetic that it couldn&#39;t even be considered one. What did Saber have to fear?

<em>ZACK!</em>

Apparently nothing, since he managed to stab Archer right in the stomach. The blade exited Bill&#39;s back, impaling him completely. A lesser man would be dead by now, but Servants were sturdy familiars. He would survive, at least for a few more minutes.

<em>cough</em>

He coughed blood through his mask, letting it drip downward. Now, if Takeru just twisted the blade a bit and-

<em>clic</em>

Something cold and hard filled their mouth, throbbing at the seams as Takeru felt a metallic cylinder choke their throat. Bill&#39;s pistol was pressed up against their lips.

&quot;Bye.&quot; Bill spat, coldly. His finger pulled the trigger. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

This Lachlan fellow, for all of his fame in recent days, had yet to get enough of her and her constant denigration.  Time to fix that!  &quot;The star of the worst-reviewed story to grace the stage all year!  I tell you, I&#39;d rather see dog feces be swarmed by flies than sit through any more of my own tale...&quot;

&quot;Still.&quot;  She seriously put her back into it, certain that something more than knots of muscle and sinew had to be contained within the chest of the Dancer.  &quot;I&#39;m certain that it&#39;ll end up the way all shit stories do...&quot;

A punchline remained undelivered as Triboulet looked up to the chest of the dancer.  Its spiteful meat, twisting about the iron of her knife, had started pulling <em>back.</em>  From her admittedly low vantage point, she could see its muscles writhing, <em>crawling</em> as they reached upward - moment by moment they reached, grasping with an alien intelligence and an attempt to swallow both the knife and the hand that wielded it.  The sight alone was new and disturbing to the fool, distracting enough that she caught the full force of the strikes to her rear.

She let go with a loud gasp, saving her hands from the flesh but surrendering the knife.  Still, her momentary bout of pain had only let the Dancer take her into a razor-sharp embrace, pulling her closer to its form and towards...everything disgusting that could possibly happen with it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136776311956840459 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136776311956840459><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 4:43 PM">4:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Were it an earlier night, she would&#39;ve tried to make some kind of goof here and hope to save herself that way.  This time, however, she relied on instinct - and force - to get herself out, free of comedy.

Her arm was scraped as she pushed against its claws, tearing the tights along her sleeve.  She grit her teeth and pulled along, and reached for her hidden store of arms - a single flick of the finger found a knife, a second slid it out of its sheath, and a third pulled it into her hand.

In one movement, she was almost freed, and she stumbled back as the Dancer&#39;s right hand was flung to the ground.  Her knife came out, flashing upward, a silvered crescent that struck wildly and without regard to herself.  Compounded with the tears the puppet&#39;s claws made her cape was cut into almost nothing, hair burst away as it was effortlessly cut, a bell was severed free of its floppy hat.  Her cheek even bled, once again marring the otherwise perfectly kept face of the court&#39;s favored soul.  This was the speed and lack of care she put into her strike, but in turn, it was fulfilled to the heights of her strength.

In turn, the Dancer&#39;s hand was ruined.  Bones and joints went snickety-snack, and off came whole fingers, all cut free of their roots.  Triboulet threw her arms back and let one leg fly, inadvertently making a mocking copy of the Dancer&#39;s own coryphee movements - if only it had the capacity to understand!

Her backside, and its hidden bandolier of knives now uncovered by the cape, bled freely from the razor-gashes of the fleshcrafted thing.  Among the few remaining blades, originally numbering five in total and down to two unused, was one thing hastily stitched onto the sheathe: the black claw of the dread Lindwyrm, her prize of a much earlier altercation.  Her back bent forward and only exacerbated the wounds, pulling them open and leaving her in further pain.  She was many things, but durable was not one of them.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136776351119061073 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136776351119061073><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 4:43 PM">4:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>A second go.  Triboulet spun about with force, and turned her stage movement into a twirl that formed a kick.  Her leg shot outward, and her hand tossed up the knife, and this acrobatic maneuver launched her blade forward like a gunshot!

This kind of fanciful maneuver was, largely, less effective than just repeating her attack.  It hit through the Dancer&#39;s hand but only cut off a few fingers, sending the knife hurtling through the air with its remaining force.  It went behind him, and toward the younger Master - missing his head by less than a foot.  Triboulet did <em>not</em> intend to almost kill the young man there, but as he steadied his gun, he had been given a reason to reconsider with the knife digging deep into the sandstone wall behind him.

Triboulet pulled another knife out - two, down to one.  She held it in opposition to the Dancer, this time far more ready to parry whatever strikes came from its remaining part-of-a-hand, and a <s>brief</s> overly wordy warning to Lachlan as well: &quot;Do you want to test if I&#39;m faster than the handgun, boy?  An odd time for such a scientific investigation!&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Now I’ll just take care of everyone else and—”

!!!

Takeru intended to celebrate his little victory. Unfortunately, the only thing he’ll be celebrating is a successful pistol endoscopy.

Acting fast, he swipes Archer’s arm as he steps aside before he could unload. His ruined innards should have him kneeling but the cowboy’s took it like a champ. He sweeps Archer off his foot before kicking him away to make distance.

The subtle changes in scenery didn’t concern him until now. It felt to him as if he was sent into a movie set, tumbleweeds tumbling about and the church having been reconstructed to have architecture inspired by the wild west. Should’ve gotten a hat to go with the scenery, but he didn’t come here to audition for spaghetti western.

 ”What’s this, Archer? What can you do against me here?”

The manifestation of Archer’s new ability did not concern him as well. There is nothing here but a desert wasteland with the only life present being them and the tumbleweeds. Does Archer think he could beat him with a change of scenery? He really has gone mad but it is unwise to think he has weakened at all. It’s the same fight to him with a different backdrop, with emphasis on the fight being the same.

Ugh, the sand is coarse, rough, and irritating. Worst part is that it’s everywhere now. When the sun is out, it gets scorching hot. When the moon is out, it gets freezing cold. It really is a harsh environment where life could barely hold on. Though it is only a minor inconvenience, it just means he’ll have to get used to it.

…

Mana surges through Takeru’s body as he receives a command seal from Gloria. Win? As vague of a command that is, he’s going to guarantee that outcome with this boost. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1136819247725694986 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1136819247725694986><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 3, 2023 7:33 PM">7:33 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Though it does worry him a little, what’s going on on her side?

Since he had kicked Archer away out of surprise, he should be here… he’s not there? He had thought he killed him with that one, stuck his guts back together probably. Is he going to shove a gun up his rear this time?

One pull, and the hammer clicked into place.

&#39;A story is only as shitty as its worst-written character,&#39; he declared, and absolutely meant it. &#39;And here I thought mine couldn&#39;t possibly be any worse.&#39;

Master of self-deprecation, meet its match. Had Triboulet not known any better, she might have assumed that this pompous asshole was toying with her emotions. And perhaps she really didn&#39;t know any better, but Lachlan was dead serious, and therein was the issue.

He was always serious, even when making an attempt at humor.

Perhaps that was why Bill and he had always struggled to see eye to eye. Kept missing each other&#39;s beats, attempted to read more than necessary into each other&#39;s words. Roland, timid and perceptive Roland, hadn&#39;t managed to figure Lachlan out over their decade-long relationship. How could Bill, who had crawled out of the depth of hell a mere fortnight ago, possibly hope to decipher the hidden agendas behind his Master&#39;s cryptic words?

Lachlan broke eye contact with the Court Jester, disregarding the absolute number she was doing on the Dancer, and turned his attention to Leapfrog&#39;s pray. &#39;So what? If I pull the trigger, you&#39;ll hack off my right arm; if I lower my weapon, you&#39;ll still flay my &quot;right arm&quot;. Damned if I do, damned if I don&#39;t. What else have I got to lose?&#39;

He shifted his gaze away once he caught onto James&#39; scheme. It seemed that the man was determined to pull him under the spell of those Mystic Eyes, leaving the both of them to die from the misfortune of being eviscerated while their consciousness stripped away. But just who was this Clock Tower flunky kidding?

Only a fool would fall for the same trick twice.

He added with a touch of sarcasm. &#39;But no thanks, really. You see, I, too, have picked up a thing or two since our last delightful encounter.&#39;

He attempted to quiet his other Hound next so that his next words could be registered. <em>&lt;I don&#39;t know, why don&#39;t you ask her yourself? I&#39;m a bit tied up at the moment.&gt;</em> Which was an understatement, considering that he was currently dealing with not one, two, or three, but a total of <em>four</em> entities with nothing but words and brain power alone. And now, with the threat of Assassin&#39;s blade looming ever so close to his body and James&#39; Mystic Eyes threatening to wrest control of his mind, he had been effectively checkmated into inaction.

Yet, with every meticulously crafted system, there was always a backdoor. Luckily, he had engineered the backdoor somewhere only he could reach.

<em>&lt;I suppose I need to ask you for a favor,&gt;</em> Lachlan rang Bill up again through their telepathic link. <em>&lt;Be a dear and wake me up when you see that man bleeding from at least three orifices on his body, yeah? You should be an old hand at this by now.&gt;</em>

<strong>He bid Bill goodnight and let go.</strong>

At once, the enormity of his puppets&#39; consciousness consumed him. The crushing weight of so many thoughts, so many sensations, so much input...just so much of <em>everything</em> was almost too much to bear. He had always relegated them to the periphery of his consciousness, containing and compartmentalizing them to ensure that <em>he</em> was the one in charge, he alone was the decision maker...

Pyg was too distant, its mental presence far too faint to influence him; Leapfrog&#39;s brain had been utterly obliterated by James, leaving behind nothing but pure instinct. This left him with the <strong>Dancer</strong>.

The Dancer, a puppet fine-tuned by his own hands, with the sole purpose of safeguarding his life. What if he relinquished control and placed its consciousness into the driver&#39;s seat of his own body...?

It was an absurd idea. Too mad, too insane. Yet, as James witnessed the puppeteer turning his head and locking those gray orbs onto him, and as the effects of his Mystic Eyes began to kick in and reconstruct the world around him...he <em>knew</em>.

<strong>Lachlan had willingly surrendered himself to the dreamscape,</strong> leaving behind an empty husk of a body...

<em>crack</em>

...ripe for the picking.

He, too, wasn&#39;t alone.

&quot;Lachlan&quot; rolled his shoulders, flexed his fingers, followed by a series of satisfying cracks as he loosened his joints. A mere second ago, he had been writhing in pain after having lost nearly both of his hands. But now they had regenerated, good as new, and he had a new toy to play with to boot.

&quot;Lachlan&quot; examined the gun in his grip. Then, slowly, he took experimental steps forward, letting his oddly small feet guide him through blades of grass. There was an unfamiliar strength to his gait, an almost inhuman fluidity in the way his limbs moved about. &quot;Lachlan&quot; prowled ahead with a rather abrupt march, as if he wasn&#39;t so used to his body being so light, so small, so...free.

His legs carried him with a nimbleness that the real Lachlan had never before achieved. His muscles strained and heart palpitated under this string of unfamiliar movements, but that didn&#39;t matter. &quot;His&quot; sole objective was to protect this body, but there would be nothing left to protect if this body&#39;s functions had ceased.

Once again, &quot;Lachlan&quot; readied his gun. And this time, he pulled the trigger the whole way through.

It was a temporary relief. He still needed to escape from underneath this damned stitched pile of meat, after all.

Each movement allowed him to inch his way out. Soon, if he can dodge a few shots using Leapfrog and his threat, hopefully, he can get back on his feet. What James *didn&#39;t account for, however, was how ready Lachlan was to dive back into the dreamscape with so many opponents surrounding him. 

&quot;Trib...oulet...&quot; The weight of Leapfrog made his tone strained as he attempted to get those words out for his Servant to hear before his mind drifted off into sleep. 

The shock in James&#39; eyes were the last thing Lachlan could see before the graveyard around them was torn up from the ground up. The projection began to fade and with it went James&#39; chance to escape on his own. Not that he could notice it, of course. He was passed out, locked in another mental battle with that damned brat, while Leapfrog slowly crushed his body and &quot;Lachlan&quot; came to deliver the Coup de gr&#226;ce to a defenceless James.

Meanwhile, in the black inky void where their collective memories flowed along either side, James stood in front of Lachlan with a look of pure disdain for the brat. &quot;You got balls, kid. Didn&#39;t think you had it in you to fall for it.&quot; Unlike last time, James kept a firm hold upon this world, choosing to leave it as a blank slate so neither held an advantage over the other. He knew what this brat was capable of now. He wasn&#39;t going to fall for it again.

Surprisingly though, James made no attempts at Lachlan, relying solely upon Triboulet to deal the finishing blow as previously discussed. While they never attempted this move before, all he could do was trust, completely unaware of his approaching doom.

Just a few more seconds before he could break the link. The more time he could buy Triboulet, the better. If only James knew...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137232394554978314 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137232394554978314><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 4, 2023 10:55 PM">10:55 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Instead, he watched them take a step back while dragging their arm away, resulting in the bullet being fired elsewhere.

<em>BANG!</em>

<em>&quot;-up?&quot;</em> He was shocked for a second, followed up by more cursing as Saber kicked him away towards the now sandy ground. They continued with their pontificating, causing much distress to the already pissed off Bill. He was never a fan of the arrogant types, especially as a fellow boastful bastard. The good news was that he had practically won now: Saber had committed a huge mistake in letting him go. Now that he had distance, he could easily-

<em><strong>&lt;The hell do ya mean wake ya up?&gt;</strong></em>

Archer was furious. Furious because he could no longer sense Lachlan in his mind. This wasn&#39;t voluntary silence or being put on mute. This was akin to someone changing rooms, leaving nothing but gaping silence in their stead. And if Lachlan&#39;s mind had changed locations, then it meant-

-Some other parasite had wormed itself in.

<em>&quot;I can&#39;t catch a fucking break!&quot;</em> Bill cursed in his mind as he sped off, running for Lachlan&#39;s last approximate location. He was forced to do so in a rush, meaning that there was no time to hide. Saber could easily see a black blot in the desert landscape running away from him like a scared cat. His target looked exposed.

<em>&quot;It&#39;s always the same.&quot;</em> Archer rambled in their mind. <em>&quot;Just when I&#39;m about to make a move. Just when I&#39;m about to finish off my target, ya fucking ruin everything.&quot;</em> His lips were bloody from the harsh biting. His thoughts were a furious mess. <em>&quot;So why do I bother?&quot;</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137370228527992893 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137370228527992893><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 8:03 AM">8:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Visions in his head. That time a classmate stole his pencil, so he beat them black and blue, but no one believed him so he got the whip. That time his mom&#39;s shepherd let a coyote snatch a chicken and pinned the blame on him instead. That time he got stoned for his skin and none of his friends intervened.

<em>&lt;Because a piece of shit like <strong>you got no one else!&gt;*</strong>

He crossed the distance as fast as he could. Those seconds felt like minutes, as his eyes got a clearer view of things: James was being held down by Leapfrog, Triboulet was toying with Dancer and &quot;Lachlan&quot; was shuffling towards their target. Pistol raised in an amateurish grip that was nonetheless enough to kill. 

*&lt;Who&#39;s gonna wash yer ass if ya keep throwing yerself in places like this? No one. That&#39;s just how it is.&gt;</em> The fact that Lachlan was no longer listening allowed Bill to shout with a bit more liberty. Some things were better left unheard. <em>&lt;There was no one to hold my back. Least I can do is make sure nobody else lives that dog of a life.&gt;</em>

With James in check, it was obvious which target Bill should look after if he planned on saving Lachlan&#39;s life. He knew a Servant&#39;s instinct all too well, to prioritize the Master&#39;s safety above anything else. He also knew of Triboulet&#39;s motherly urges.

&quot;He may be slow, <strong>but I&#39;m faster!&quot;</strong> He caught Assassin in the tail end of her boasting, his guns already out and pointed to Triboulet&#39;s head and arms. &quot;The hell do ya think yer doing, sullying our deal?!&quot; He shouted like an angry beast, like dealing with a lacklustre co-worker. He couldn&#39;t believe an Assassin could be so unprofessional about their past contracts, that&#39;s all.

&quot;Ya lay a finger on my Master and yer fucking dead!&quot; Archer warned, and just to make sure his bark was as bad as his bite, he pulled the trigger.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137370286027702322 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137370286027702322><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 8:03 AM">8:03 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>BANG!</em>

A bullet headed straight for Triboulet. She barely had time to react to it. All she knew was that the Dancer looked a lot less threatening now compared to the furious Archer on her trail. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She barely heard James&#39; words come out of his mouth, the <em>signal,</em> and then his consciousness departed before she could question his choice.

It was probably correct, though.  The opponents on the field had dropped to a wounded Dancer and its controller, and in one move, he had neutralized the other - now time for Triboulet to make her own one move.  Her dagger went from threatening Lachlan to cutting to the left...and then right, and then left, and then right again.  

This abomination was fast, to the point she would congratulate it if it were human, but for every one glancing blow that scraped with sparks off the thing&#39;s remaining claws another cut deep.  She wasn&#39;t aiming for vitals, she was simply attacking wildly and with intent to de-limb it as soon as possible.  It was resilient, but soon, it gave up seemingly - that last strike must&#39;ve cut it down, because it started to fall limp before she cut it a few more times for good measure.

In the end, what was left was the legless body of her enemy - the remaining bladed arm hung on barely, but what would it do, crawl at her?  She hopped over it, and looked towards Lachlan.  She was going to get him out of this fight, if it meant throwing him in a trash can or what not, and then...

...Hmm.

From within the confines of his headspace, James heard his Assassin&#39;s projection come through: <em>James, you missed!</em>  This was followed up shortly with: <em>HOW?!  Archer&#39;s Master is still right there, running, moving!  Did your eyes wander at the last moment?  Did you look too hard at that toad or something?</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137492722706555051 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137492722706555051><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 4:09 PM">4:09 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>He moved, alright.  Lachlan had a gait that called to mind a diseased stag, still moving with the grace of a deer but letting the weight of its horns turn its effortless trot into an unreal swagger, head bobbing up and down, eyes glazed...Triboulet couldn&#39;t guess at this, for the real reason was so far beyond her understanding that she never would.  Had James&#39; Mystic Eyes only <em>half-fired</em> or something, leaving Lachlan in a sleepwalk...with a gun at the ready?

That gun wasn&#39;t the only one, either!  Triboulet wheeled about, Bill having found her at the least opportune time.  She shouted right back, &quot;I&#39;m not!  I&#39;ve not touched a perfectly-tussled hair on his head!&quot;  This wasn&#39;t an exclamation with a point; she could tell just by tone that he wanted blood.  There wasn&#39;t going to be an easy out, or mercy, this time.

She gave him blood.  Her body contorted out of the way in a violent jerk, leaving her hand in the line of fire - and this hand gave a noble sacrifice in the name of comedy.  The bullet ripped through, effortlessly removing a single finger.  She shouted in pain, gripping her hand and falling to her knees.  &quot;Oh, Bill!  My rugged country starling!  Auggh, <em>fuck,</em> you really did it now!&quot;

Her hand was raised to show the tragic loss...and she then drew back all of her fingers to keep the stump of one raised.  The middle finger, what was left of it, remained rigid as she gave nothing more than her best grin to him.  &quot;My songbird, it seems you&#39;ve removed this bird of mine!&quot;

This couldn&#39;t be kept up.  She was supposed to get out of this alive, and if she was taking hits every time with the sole purpose of facilitating garbage puns they would add up dramatically.  God, please let this finger be the only casualty...</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137492737348882502 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137492737348882502><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 5, 2023 4:10 PM">4:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Still, for the moment, she was alive and left in capacity.

He&#39;s fighting my Master three-to-one, I am <em>protecting</em> him, so go back and get impaled b--&quot;

<em>BANG</em>

Another shot?!  From so close?  Triboulet immediately ran her good hand over her body, checking for freshly opened holes - she&#39;s caught onto your game at least a little, Bill - but she finds none.  It came from behind.  All of this was a painful distraction, leaving Lachlan open for the shot!

What came next was all so predictable, but it came quick.  Triboulet&#39;s knife scraped up toward the sky, and it came just as fast as his bullet.  It was in no danger of killing Archer, but instead wounding - he had leaned down to gawk, and in turn, his face was left open!  The blade cut straight up, leaving his face superficially wounded.  Moreover, his <em>mask</em> was almost wholly cut open from top to bottom!

With this cut came a flip, and a handstand, and any number of acrobatic maneuvers to say that she was launching herself at &quot;Lachlan&quot; to tackle him away from James, and prevent him from getting a second shot in.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Though it’s far from over, it just means starting from square one. If they can get that close once, they can get even closer next time. Perhaps he should cut him up and spill his guts all over the place, might trip on his hanging entrails when he runs away again.

Speaking of running away, Archer appears to be… running away. As in, he’s disengaging. Takeru is quite confused as to why, perhaps his wounds are too much for him or he just felt like going on a jog. EIther way, an Archer is an Archer. Can’t let him get away and allow potshots at him again.

 ”Let me give you a parting gift first, Archer.”

Takeru looked for something to compensate for his lack of range. It wasn’t long till his eyes landed on a dying tree. He sheathed his blade before he delivered a powerful chop at the base of the tree, leaving a stump behind while the rest was in his hands. It’s quite big, perhaps Archer used it to hide at some point.

Being big, it’s perfect as a projectile. Might hit a bunch of people at once if he just lobs it at just the right spot.

Takeru takes aim. Where the enemy had run off to lie silhouettes of multiple figures. Archer, Assassin, and others are having a lovely ball over there, sad Takeru wasn&#39;t there from the start. Seems really tense there, very exciting indeed.

He launches the dead tree with great force. Like a low flying cruise missile, it rips through the air as it heads to its target.

Takeru isn’t exactly a good shot, but, with how big the thing is, it’s bound to hit <em>something</em>. Fortunate if it hits the intended target, unfortunate if it hits his allies. But, what can he do about it? He’s no Archer himself.

Sword in hand once again, Takeru makes his way towards where everyone else is. There is this feeling that something is really really off. What is going on over at Gloria&#39;s side of the finale? Asking soft and low,

 &quot;Master, are you alright over there? Stay intact, would you?&quot; ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It sounded like a stupid question—what else could he possibly have meant? What actions would one usually take when they had to rouse someone from their slumber? What actions would Cherokee Bill take?

<em>&lt;Easy. Just give me a good kick like you always—&gt;</em>

And the connection abruptly snapped.

...

..

.

He was back in the &#39;room&#39;.

His previous visit here had been a lot more turbulent. He had been dragged in against his will, kicking and screaming, a captive in a never-ending nightmare. He had used up every trick in his book, just to crawl his way out, back into the real world...

So much had happened since then.

&#39;Not going to make me relive my past again, are you?&#39; Lachlan examined his nails, before raking his fingers through his hair. He was still very much himself—whole and not transformed into some distorted reflection of his traumatic past. Although James had ensnared him within the dreamscape, he hadn&#39;t done much more than that. 

There was no light, but Lachlan found his vision oddly unimpaired. He was able to discern every single detail on James&#39; face, each line etched with sheer anger and undoubtedly directed at the redheaded brat. The lack of detail in this bleak void they now stood in, the lack of...well, <em>anything</em>, gave him the biggest hint: James had not planned—at least, not at the moment—to unleash the full extent of his Mystic Eyes&#39; powers.

&#39;Tsk, that won&#39;t do.&#39; Lachlan relaxed his shoulders upon this realization, his lips pulling into a grin. &#39;If you&#39;re going to act, then commit all the way. Why use your Eyes in the first place if you&#39;re just going to half-ass the execution? I even saved you the trouble by inviting myself over. What exactly are you waiting for?&#39;

He looked up, as if lost in contemplation. &#39;Perhaps,&#39; he let the word hang for a moment, before returning to meet James&#39; eyes, &#39;for your dear Servant to finish me off?&#39;

His grin widened.

<em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

The first bullet buried itself deep into James&#39; shoulder, yet the man remained unperturbed, his body temporarily robbed of its soul by its owner&#39;s own design. &quot;Lachlan&quot; quickened his pace, if it was possible for his body to even do so. The clashing of metal on metal reached his ears, and he briefly glanced over his shoulder...

His comrade, the &quot;puppet&quot; in red, had failed to restrain the petite women who had just diced up his old body. She was upon him in an instant, with a speed far outpacing his own and intending to tackle him to the ground. What was the best course of action to take in order to preserve his current body?

<s>dodge</s>
<s>retaliate</s>
seek cover

The moment Assassin attacked, &quot;Lachlan&quot; mimicked her movements and lunged himself at the Sleeping Beauty on the ground. His clawless fingers found themselves on James&#39; chest, scratching habitually—albeit ineffectually—as he wrapped his arms around the man and pulled him into a somewhat sitting position. &quot;Lachlan&quot; used James as makeshift cover, while his other hand clumsily began to reload the next bullet.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137851305377935411 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137851305377935411><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 6, 2023 3:54 PM">3:54 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The shock of seeing it all again is lost on the second trip through. I scoured through your worst ones and, though you nearly broke, you bounced back. Ain&#39;t no beating that.&quot; James made no moves when Lachlan closed the distance between the two of them. No fists were raised. No weapons, nor memories, were armed against this advance. There wasn&#39;t much neither of them could do here. James just needed to wait, after all.

Whatever effort he could spend here would be wasted and pointless when all the work could be done by another he trusts. There was no room to be careless when he was already so close to his goal.

&quot;Archer is kept busy with Saber. Do you really think he could come to your aid in time when my Servant is already so close to you? Come on, kid. I know you can be arrogant but you can&#39;t also be stupid as well.&quot; James tilted his head and tapped on the side while he stared down Lachlan. If only he knew.

&quot;I have learned enough through your memories. If you had any more tricks to pull out of your sleeve, I&#39;m afraid it is too late to-&quot; James&#39; eyes shot open as the rest of the air in his lungs were forced out, stealing what he needed to finish his sentence. 

A breathless groan of pain was pushed through gritted teeth. Soon, the older man fell onto one knee. A hand went over the spot where the source of the pain was but James could feel nothing. Was he stabbed? No, he saw Triboulet dealing with Dancer. Archer wouldn&#39;t miss an easy shot like that either. He was a damn Servant! That just leaves...

Whatever time he bought Triboulet, he hoped that it was enough. <em>It was time to wake up.</em>

The horizon of the expansive void torn up into the air, revealing a bright white light, before collapsing around them. Any memories that were floating around from either of them were the first to go. One last look was exchanged between the two of them. The difference of the level of skill between a Clock Tower dropout and a prodigy was painful clear to him now.

...

..

.

&quot;...Aaaahh!&quot; James woke up screaming. The bleed from the bullet wound stained his last good shirt. It took him awhile to take in his surroundings. He was pulled out from under Leapfrog, albeit just a bit, and placed into a sitting position. The culprit? That damned kid. Whatever he did, he managed to still control his body through what he can only assume was his puppetry skills. 

Now that he was awake, he could start to fight back. One hand went straight for the gun to try and wrestle it out of his hand. The other one went to try and scratch out his eyes. At least, that was what he wanted to do. His arm couldn&#39;t lift high enough to reach due to the pain that erupted in his shoulder from the bullet hole. Great. Just one good arm to work with now.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1137915563293823037 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1137915563293823037><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 6, 2023 8:10 PM">8:10 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Too little, too late, as he had already fired. That was him being <em>nice.</em>

<em>BANG!</em>

The Assassin found herself with one less finger. A very important one, too. Like any comedian worth their salt, however, she immediately spun that tragedy into a veritable joke, flipping Bill off (or at least trying to) and putting up a brave face as she knelt in pain.

&quot;And I&#39;ll do it again if ya keep this up. Keep my Master out of yer grasp.&quot; He threatened, only to receive a snarl back. Triboulet justified herself, using some reasonable, if not straight up understandable logic to explain her deeds. Bill was having none of that.

<em>clic</em>

&quot;And I should have killed ya both. Instead I let ya go. Now, why the <em>hell</em> did I go and do that?&quot; Bill asked, almost as if questioning himself too. His finger rested on the trigger as the gun was now pointed towards one of Triboulet&#39;s eyes. He was irate. His lips pursed, ready to spew more words, until a <em>BANG!</em> could be heard. One that hadn&#39;t come from Bill&#39;s own gun.

Not like Triboulet could tell, since she cowered immediately. It took a few seconds for her to grasp that it wasn&#39;t Archer who had fired, but someone else. She turned around and saw what Bill had seen: An erratic Lachlan burying a bullet in James&#39; shoulder.

<em>&quot;So, he actually did it. Gave himself in. What a joke.&quot;</em> Bill spat in irritation. He would find it praiseworthy if it didn&#39;t feel so desperate. The fact that Lachlan had instantly gone for that move either implied utmost trust in Bill or worse, no trust at all. It was easy to resort to desperate measures if you had no one else to rely on.

He wished it didn&#39;t have to be that way.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138195818655006802 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138195818655006802><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, August 7, 2023 2:43 PM">2:43 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Though, that being said, Bill was thinking a bit too much. So much, in fact, that Assassin took advantage of it and slashed at him while he was staring at his Master in the distance. The knife stabbed next to his chin, almost hitting his carotid artery as it instead swiped up and slashes his lips, nose and mask.

<strong>&quot;GUH!&quot;</strong> Gunshots were fine. Knives were <em>not.</em> He had always hated them. The prickly feeling of a large needle invading your skin, separate your flesh and lacerating your nerves. Even worse was the closeness, which is why he felt a tinge of relief as Assassin left to look after her Master instead.

Of course, this meant that she was now after Lachlan again.

&quot;I-<em>glub</em> warned you!&quot; Bill gargled, trying his best to hide his face as he choked on his own blood. &quot;Stay away from him-!&quot;

<em>THUMP!</em>

Triboulet had left just in the nick of time. Had she stayed a second later, she would have met Bill&#39;s same fate. Crushed by the large remains of a dead tree, courtesy of Saber. Archer&#39;s body went limp, then silence. No one witnessed his death. No one even realized that he had disappeared, but his heart had already stopped beating.

Such was the death of Cherokee Bill. A dog with no master who deserved nothing more than the death of a scourge. To die unknown and unloved.

But as we all know, legends live forever.

James had woken up from his slumber, realizing just how foolish he had been. The Dowling had pulled a swift one over him as he now realized he was in the grasp of a different Lachlan, most likely one of the boy&#39;s own puppets. Even worse, the puppet was using him as some sort of human shield, stopping Triboulet from fully intervening.

He struggled valiantly, knowing that it would take a few more moments for Lachlan to be booted out of the dream world. So long as he could press the advantage before that, he still had the upper-

<em>STOMP!</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138195869754216510 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138195869754216510><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, August 7, 2023 2:44 PM">2:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
His body went cold. It felt like a hammer struck down at his chest, then at his neck. Spuds were grinding at his throat, threatening to rip it apart and cause blood to spill over. It was a cowboy&#39;s boot.

Assassin would be shocked, to see the shadow of Bill lingering amongst Lachlan and James. He looked no worse for wear, lacking any form of dust, blood or detritus at all. Even his mask was now stitched back together, with no stitches to show the extent of the repairs. She knew that Masters could help Servants regenerate their injuries, like how James could most likely repair her finger, but how could an unconscious Lachlan do the same for Bill?

&quot;Noble Phantasm: <strong>Ballad of Cherokee Bill.&quot;</strong> A string of familiar words left the outlaw&#39;s mouth. Triboulet remembered them clearly. It was what she had asked for during that shameful, drunk competition of theirs. She knew that Archer wasn&#39;t one to lie about the name of their Noble Phantasm. There was zero doubt now that he had just used it, but for what?

&quot;I can&#39;t fucking die. Not by some trite shit like that, at least.&quot; Bill grinned, nodding his head towards the dead tree in the distance. His corpse had vanished. &quot;Ya think this is new to me? Being shot at? Stabbed at? Getting motherfuckin&#39; trees thrown at?&quot; He growled, grabbing at his mask and pulling it hard.

<em>rrrrrrrriiiiiip</em>

&quot;Do ya know how many people I&#39;ve killed? How many lives I&#39;ve ruined? How many bullets I still have left?&quot;

It ripped to shreds.

&quot;I am <strong>Cherokee Bill!</strong> Ya want me dead, then do it right!&quot; He gloated, applying pressure on James&#39; neck, no doubt as a way to both threaten and antagonize Triboulet. His long, unkempt hair covered his furious glare, directed towards not only Assassin, but entirety of the battle in front of him. He was so close to his goal. A goal that not even Lachlan could have dreamed of.

Or maybe, deep down, he knew? That&#39;s why he knew he could rely on him?</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138195935202132018 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138195935202132018><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Monday, August 7, 2023 2:44 PM">2:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
&quot;So, what&#39;s it gonna be, Tribble?&quot; Bill asked, two pistols out. One pointed to her, but the other...

...Pointed to James.

&quot;Give up on the Grail, and I&#39;ll at least let youse two run with yer tail between yer legs.&quot; He said, before immediately narrowing his eyes.

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d say, at least. But yer not a saint, are ya? Yer a hungry mutt, just like me. Can&#39;t wait to see yerself digging yer hands into the Grail.&quot; Bill stated. His grip tightened. He was ready to fill a bullet in James&#39; skull and get rid of another threat on his list.

But one question still ate at him.

&quot;This makes no difference to me, but-&quot; Archer continued. &quot;-why do ya fight, Assassin? What motivated ya to keep going? Yer wish? Yer Master? Just felt like it?&quot; He waved his gun around, as if asking her to reply quickly.

&quot;Tell me or don&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m killing yer Master anyway.&quot; <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet bolted right up to Lachlan, swiping her hand across the back of his shoeleather as she had only just missed him.  Like a cat, on all fours she scrambled after him, hands pulling through grave dirt and arid moss with abandon.  Each drag of her stump across the terrain felt as though she was dragging her wound across a lit stove, and compounded with her prior encounter with Bill&#39;s boot.

She would&#39;ve gone for it, all-but ignorant to the danger presented, but Bill went out with as little fanfare as possible.  Her crawl stopped, her head craned back, and she found herself looking at the man&#39;s arm poking out from underneath a sizeable log.  No twitching, no last-minute scrabbling for purchase.

This sudden development, even with James in danger, made her pause.  Was that to be it?  Bill, dead like that, with no second chance?  This was inglorious, and...and it made her feel quite odd, really.  She wasn&#39;t sure how to put it.  It almost made her forget what she was after, really, it did.

One more dagger, one that&#39;d been with her from the beginning, seemingly manifested within the workings of Lachlan&#39;s revolver.  Between its spinning chamber and the barrel, thin metal had shoved right on in with a violent squeal - disarming him, making the gun useless.  Damn thing was jammed quite badly, I tell you - not unfixable, but perhaps not so easy when you&#39;re laying underneath a man.

Masterful precision.  She didn&#39;t even know that was possible prior to seeing it with her own eyes, but you can force quite a few things with dumb strength, she supposed.

In all, she was down to one knife.  No more throwing tricks from her - undoubtedly to be a hamstring in the battle with Saber that was about to transpire, whether she liked it or not.  She turned to speak to the man, saying &quot;I&#39;m quite sorry, but refrain from doing me in the same way, please, Takeru?  I want my death to be as pathetic as possible, yes, but perhaps a bit slower.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138349238296784999 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138349238296784999><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 8, 2023 12:53 AM">12:53 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Only, perhaps vindicating some of those odd feelings, there were still three entrants left.  Bill remained, alive and threatening to crush James if he didn&#39;t up and blow him away.  She would&#39;ve reacted, hoping to once again be fast on the draw, but she hadn&#39;t even taken out her last knife and that time alone would&#39;ve been enough.

Bill had questions.  Even now?  Really?  Triboulet almost didn&#39;t believe him.  For someone who had called himself an unfeeling brute, he was sure as hell inquisitive.  A hand was pushed back at Takeru, impatiently even.  It took a moment of consideration, but she shook her head at him.  <em>Let me handle this,</em> she silently said.  Arms outstretched and nine fingers displayed, lacking in weapons now, she offered peace for just a moment.

&quot;Oh?  Oh, is that right?&quot;  She craned her neck low, and then her back arched as she looked up at him in that cat-like playing way she was prone to take.  &quot;You&#39;re immortal?  Then we&#39;re two birds of the same feather!  It&#39;s why I haven&#39;t ever feared God&#39;s reaper so much as I&#39;ve joked as he runs the threshing scythe about my neck, Bill - my own Noble Phantasm, <strong>Le Roi est Amus&#233;.</strong>&quot;  Like to like, she gave him her own secret - and only made its inner workings more mysterious, just as he did.

&quot;Why should I worry?&quot;  She shrugged, and looked...dismissively down at her Master.  &quot;Even if you blasted him away, <em>I would persist.</em>  God Himself put me on this Earth to be His most persistent cockroach, and He&#39;s still kicking Himself over that decision!&quot;

&quot;And yet, no.  I&#39;d rather you not.  That&#39;d positively ruin my day.  It took me a while to understand, delivered unto Ruler a half-truth to cover for it,&quot; she jerked her head backward in a vague direction, &quot;but I do need that wish.  You&#39;re right.

I&#39;ve admitted as much!  My fame served me well.  My fame, it&#39;s given me so much grief, but without it I would not be in contention.  With the Grail, I have this one shot to become a new person!  To be given the same choices that everyone else has in this world!&quot;

&quot;I fight because I have had enough of being Triboulet, Le Fevrial, <em>Assassin,</em> as I wish to be <strong>Nicolette Ferrial.</strong>&quot;

She took an exploratory step.  Her breathing took an upswing in tempo, and her eyes darted toward her Master - a mistake, perhaps made to see what his own reaction would be, but one that she caught.  She resumed locking eyes with Archer.

&quot;And that useless waste on the side of the street, Nicolette, she shan&#39;t do anything for anyone <em>but herself.</em>  Freedom to do whatever the hell she pleases.  I can imagine you&#39;re looking for much the same thing, Bill, but I&#39;m, indeed, a cockroach.  Too greedy of an insect to allow you it.&quot;

&quot;I suppose that&#39;s what this comes down to.&quot;  She sneaks a glance at Takeru - not so much a hidden code for something as a check to see if he&#39;s readying himself to slay in the moment.  She kind of understood Bill&#39;s drive to understand his enemy, now.  

With Bill placated, if just for a moment, and Lachlan being kept down to his hands to fight, just a little bit of time for a question was spared.  &quot;We wouldn&#39;t be here if we weren&#39;t all greedy.  What&#39;s it that drives thee, o&#39; useless heroes of yore, to kill here and now?&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

 ”You say it as if you can choose how you die, Assassin.”

Hmm, huh.

Archer’s really dead. His corpse is right there. His body emanates no life whatsoever. Though the caster may be dead, the spell remains active. Perhaps it’ll dematerialize in a minute or two, but then…

There he is. Like a roach, he survived a killing blow. Takeru looks back at the dead only to see it remain dead. He had thought it was a little sleight of hand trick until Archer, or rather, Cherokee Bill said that he is unkillable. Makes for a reliable pincushion.

Before he could make a move, Assassin pushed him back. Strange how she went from “kill him now” to “kill him later”. Takeru raises his guard with his sword forward, just in case things get messy.

It may seem that they’re both immortal, huh. For a bit, Takeru feels alienated. He looks at his wounds and is reminded of how easy it is to die right now. Each mistake would lead him closer and closer to his demise. If they’re really unkillable, that would make such a fate be the guaranteed outcome of this struggle for the grail. But, as always, there’s only one way to find out if that really is the truth.

He stays silent as Assassin, well, Triboulet answers Bill’s question. What does she fight for? Power? Wealth? Regrets? It seems that she fights for something more personal. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138638194036981832 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138638194036981832><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Tuesday, August 8, 2023 8:01 PM">8:01 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She fights to be someone else, how adorable.

Takeru isn’t exactly interested in philosophy talk, especially in a situation like this. If they were just lounging on a couch, then it would be perfectly fine. His worries make him gradually impatient, he needs to win this fight asap before misfortune arrives to give him the news. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Not that he was genuinely intrigued by James&#39; explanations, but he wanted to count down the seconds. Time might have worked differently here compared to the real world, but still—every second that he held James&#39; attention, was a precious second where someone in reality—whether his &#39;stunt double&#39;, or Bill, or even Leapfrog—would kill the man for good.

After all, what were the chances of an unconscious body strewn across a heated battlefield staying unscathed? If a direct attack didn&#39;t kill him, then surely some collateral damage would easily administer that much needed coup de gr&#226;ce.

Which was why he actually felt <em>disappointed</em>, when James suddenly buckled in pain. The man clutched his shoulder, as if he had just been...

&#39;Shot,&#39; Lachlan connected the dots. A shame. He had actually wanted to stay in the dreamscape for a bit longer. 

But the world was already collapsing around them, dark void crumbling piece by piece, distorting his vision, his awareness, his sense of self...

...

Lachlan woke up to a world of screams.

Not literally, no. But rather within his headspace, the puppeteer found himself at the receiving end of a maelstrom of shrieking, wailing, and mad howls of pain. It took him by surprise, but he quickly oriented himself, remembered where he was, and saw—through the eyes of a vessel that was just starting to feel a touch unfamiliar to him—the twitching, spasming figure sprawled on the ground that used to belong to his Dancer.

Assassin had meticulously dismembered the Dancer, reducing it to a writhing, limbless worm. And now the puppet lay uselessly on the ground, hanging on to the precipice of life by the thinnest, flimsiest thread.


No wonder the Dancer was loathe to go back to their original body.

Stuffing old laundry into an already cramped hamper. Besides, unlike Pyg, the Dancer only had a single consciousness. He could manage, he <em>could</em>, even if he did just survive another mental attack...

With tremendous effort he pushed the Dancer&#39;s voice aside and took over the driver&#39;s seat...

...

He was jerked up, again. This time, sensations returned to his body. Soft grass licking his angle, the chill of metal against his palm, the stabbing pain in his fingers as if they&#39;d just been crushed, and the pressure of a grown man&#39;s weight against his legs—feedback upon feedback upon feedback rushed through his spinal nerves.

Lachlan gasped. He fought down a wave of nausea and righted himself, mind spinning, then assessed his surroundings and tried to understand what was happening.

He looked down, and saw James pinned to the ground, underneath the heel of Archer&#39;s boots. Assassin engaged in some kind of discourse with Bill, and Saber was hot on their heels, but oh, these were all such secondary details compared to the words he&#39;d been <em>dying</em> to get off his chest...

<em>&lt;See? Everything worked out just fine.&gt;</em> 

This was not trust. No, there was absolutely no trust whatsoever to speak of between Lachlan James Dowling and Cherokee Bill. If Bill threatened to shoot Lachlan in the back, the puppeteer would force the Archer to put a bullet through his own head by invoking a Command Seal. Likewise, the instant Lachlan expressed any intent to impose punishment, Bill would no doubt lodge a bullet between the lad&#39;s teeth.

Camaraderie? Trust? Friendship? 

<strong>Who the hell needs those?</strong>

When two ravenous hyenas inexplicably found themselves on the only path to their next meal, with hunters and predators lurking along the way, primal instinct drove them to solidarity. They would sooner rip out the throats of their rivals than turn against each other. 

Hunger, and necessity. The truth, when boiled down to the essentials, really was as simple as that. 

&#39;Who cares if the Servant survives without their Master? The Grail won&#39;t answer to a Masterless Servant anyway.&#39; Lachlan drove a wedge into Bill and Triboulet&#39;s teary reunion. &#39;Go on then, Bill. Finish what you started.&#39;

He dangled the seven-shooter in front of him, jammed up chamber and dagger and all.

&#39;Or I will.&#39; With what? Was that his attempt at sarcasm?

The now useless gun slipped off his fingers and tumbled to the ground. Lachlan extended his hand, backside facing up, and extended it towards Bill. His fingers twitched slightly, as if silently urging the Archer to—

<em>Take it,</em> his expression seemed to say. <em>Take it and kneel.</em>

But his words carried a different command.

&#39;I order you with my Command Spell, Cherokee bill,&#39; the puppeteer said pleasantly. <strong>&#39;Fuck them all up.&#39;</strong></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 6:02 PM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138946007632203837 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138946007632203837><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 4:24 PM">4:24 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Piles and piles of bright yellow hidden underneath the dirt of a river stream. Problems arose when you didn&#39;t know how to look or where to look, but even worse was the struggle of knowing why you looked in the first place. Gold to sustain yourself? To store as a keepsake? To use for old rituals? Or even just admiring its beauty?

Bill didn&#39;t know why he coveted gold. It was just what his entire life revolved around. Gather money to spend money. Keep running to avoid being caged. It was never once dull. Not once did he feel comfortable, nor did he run the risk of his skills growing rusty. His lifestyle was the golden standard for outlaws, one where they resembled errant legends more than living, breathing people.

But he never once thought about what made him tick. What his goal was. All he knew was that all of the stuff he had half-assed was significant enough for him to be inscribed into the Throne of Heroes. He didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or be furious. How could he even qualify as a Heroic Spirit like that? Were thoughtless actions really all you needed to be considered an hero?

That&#39;s why he couldn&#39;t resist asking Assassin for her thoughts. As a fellow Servant, did they ever have thoughts of this caliber? A lack of want that translated into a desire for the Grail? 

No. Triboulet had a clear goal. The Grail was just a means to an end. She explained it eloquently, adding every detail of what she had planned to do once she won. A second chance at life. Greedy indeed.

She was ahead of him in several ways, exuding confidence in her decision. Archer might have even felt intimidated if this had been his first encounter with a Servant. Alas, he had already felt the return of Lachlan&#39;s thoughts, humming in his cranium.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138981047233675416 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138981047233675416><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 6:44 PM">6:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;See? Everything worked out just fine.&gt;</em>

No it didn&#39;t, you rat bastard. Once again, you went off in your little world and expected this dog of a Servant to pick up your pieces.

But that&#39;s exactly why we work so well.

<em>&quot;-Don&#39;t we?&quot;</em> Bill giggled to himself as his Master slowly stood up. He didn&#39;t need trust, nor did he need a goal. He just needed to win, win and keep winning. There was no point in thinking about what you wanted if you were too weak to obtain it. Only the strong had the privilege of choosing their path.

He had to earn his right to the Grail first, and he sure as hell didn&#39;t think Assassin or Saber deserved it. If there was anyone who deserved to lay hands on the Grail amongst them, it was his Master. He would make sure that the delivery was swift and efficient.

Even if it was costly.

&quot;Nice speech. Bet you&#39;ve been saving that for a while.&quot; That was the most Triboulet got from the scumbag Archer. &quot;If ya just wanted a simple life, ya shouldn&#39;t have come here. Only an idiot thinks they can live in peace after spilling blood.&quot; He cracked a smile, followed by Lachlan interrupting the two. Clearly, he had enough of Servants being chummy with each other. He suggested Bill to expedite things instead.

And that suggestion soon turned into an order. Lachlan&#39;s words conveyed authority, seals burning bright as the second streak gradually faded from the boy&#39;s skin. The command was heard loud and clear.

<strong>&quot;Fuck them all up.&quot;</strong>

Bill couldn&#39;t agree with that more.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138981099041718302 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138981099041718302><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 6:44 PM">6:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><a href="https://youtu.be/eFxMD3I2BIA">https://youtu.be/eFxMD3I2BIA</a></span></div><div class=chatlog__embed><div class=chatlog__embed-color-pill style=background-color:rgba(255,0,0,255)></div><div class=chatlog__embed-content-container><div class=chatlog__embed-content><div class=chatlog__embed-text><div class=chatlog__embed-author-container><a class=chatlog__embed-author-link href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqoPovYHMsOcOBkeNKjeTw><div class=chatlog__embed-author>Shirayuki Kitomi</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-title><a class=chatlog__embed-title-link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFxMD3I2BIA"><div class="chatlog__markdown chatlog__markdown-preserve">Haikyuu!! 2nd Season OST - Direct Confrontation</div></a></div><div class=chatlog__embed-youtube-container><iframe class=chatlog__embed-youtube src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFxMD3I2BIA width=400 height=225></iframe></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1138981237072080956 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1138981237072080956><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 6:44 PM">6:44 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em><strong>BANG!</strong></em>

He acted immediately, firing a bullet aimed for James&#39; skull. Then, knowing that would already attract his targets&#39; attention, he focused on the stronger of the two while they were still distracted.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

Three more bullets aimed towards Saber&#39;s eyes, neck and groin. He didn&#39;t care if he deflected or not, because his fingers were already sliding out ammo and replacing it with more. It didn&#39;t matter, since his guns never needed to be reloaded as a Servant, but it was just instinct. The thrill of a fight made him perform at his peak, breaking the boundaries of his human limitations.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

Mouth. Knee. Arm.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

Sword. Stomach. Spine.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

Head. Heart. Chest.

He kept firing until Saber had turned into a mountain of holes. The moment one of his targets was gone, Triboulet would become child&#39;s play to deal with.

<em>&lt;Ya best get outta here,&gt;</em> He quickly conveyed to Lachlan in the midst of the chaotic gunfire. <em>&lt;unless ya wanna set an example for Masterless Servants yourself!&gt;</em> <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bullets rain upon him, he waves his sword to swat them away but, alas, he had not expected the increase in intensity. For a bullet deflected, two would enter him. He was unable to keep up.

Takeru felt crippled by the severity of his wounds. He can’t move, he can’t lift a finger, he can’t even blink. His grip on his weapon wavers as his body fails on him. His mind couldn’t parse the situation, but the rest had already understood. Unable to endure, he falls.

Falling. Falling. Falling. Falling. Falling.

It all felt slow. Takeru thought not about the decisions he had made but about what he could do. He forced himself to stand but he could not even listen to his own commands. He denied the invitation of death but death persists. Eventually, he realized the futility of his actions and continued to fall.

Falling. Falling. Falling. Falling. Falling.

It all felt really really slow. In his dying thoughts, he recalled the time where he felt just as helpless as he is now. Just like then, he could not lift a finger, his legs already gave out, his sword can’t support him like a cane would.

It is a shame that he could not win the grail, shame he could not see his Master one last time, shame that the wishes of the two could never come true. He dies lamenting his failures.

…

<em>What is my name?</em>

Yamato Takeru. Well, he wasn’t always Yamato Takeru. The young prince, Ousu, had earned the name through defeating the Kumaso Takeru brothers. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139053307629944922 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139053307629944922><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 11:31 PM">11:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Not a single person but him defeated the two and, as a reward, inherited the name Takeru. Takeru, meaning ‘the Brave’.

He lived up to his name, having conquered the entirety of Japan all by himself. Slaying various deities and squashing any resistance against the rule of Yamato. It took a deity and an error to end his campaign so he wonders why he would lose to someone like Bill, an outlaw.

It is not right to die like this. Not to people like him.

Step.

Takeru musters what strength he has to plant a foot backwards, keeping him from falling further. A little struggle and now he’s standing with his sword held firm. Blood pools beneath his foot yet his strength does not wane.

 ”<em>Yamato Takeru</em>… is not done yet.”

He sounds weak and he looks pale. He should not be able to speak, let alone stand. Yet he does. He knows he does not have enough time left so, without hesitation, he begins his final interaction. Holding his sword to his chest, he chants out loud.

 ”<strong>Behold, the treasured sword of my ancestor, Susanoo!</strong>”

First a whisper, then came a roar. The wind blows towards the sword, swirling around the blade as it gathers into a vortex. Leaves are plucked off trees, loose branches are pulled, and small stones inch towards the growing whirlwind emanating from his blade. A faint floaty feeling could be felt by those around him, as if they too are being sucked into his twister.

 <strong>”The clouds shall gather and coalesce within its blade!”</strong>

The vortex grows and grows. Its roar is deafening, its height towers over human architecture, its strength can be felt by the Earth itself. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139053485749448754 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139053485749448754><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 11:31 PM">11:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>If one looks up, it looks as if the sky is tearing itself apart, revealing the stars hidden beyond the clouds.

Trees bend, branches are pulled, and stones are lifted. To stand is to get pelted and pricked by rocks and sticks. One’s balance becomes off as the wind becomes hard to ignore.

 <strong>”Brew a raging storm and release with all your might!”</strong>

…

 ”Master, can you see this?”

No one can see it but Takeru is already dematerializing. He had used what time he had left, what mana he still had within him into this prayer of his: a prayer for victory. The heavens have answered and commanded the currents to bend to his will for this very moment.

The chant culminates into a deafening silence. The vortex shrinks in an instant with its gathered strength concentrated within the sword.  Leaves, branches, rocks, all that was lifted falls to the ground. The swordsman lowers his weapon, seemingly exhausted. He’s not bleeding anymore, he’s as still as a statue as well.

It’s not wrong to think he is dead and has worn himself out, that’s because he is. Everyone can see him disintegrating into golden dust, slowly dissipating into the air. However, he chose not to rest just yet. He can’t bear the thought of dying weak and helpless like in life.

Now, the young prince prepares to unleash the might of his sword. His heavenly sword of valor; the manifestation of his unwavering determination to win even against death itself. Under his breath, he announces its intent.

 <strong>”My Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi shall judge you now.”</strong>

In an instant, Takeru swings his blade around him in a circular motion. It cuts through falling leaves, igniting them from the speed. ▶</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139053498474958879 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139053498474958879><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, August 9, 2023 11:31 PM">11:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The silence is then broken by the powerful gale that follows afterwards.

Whoosh.

Weak trees collapse under the force of the wind. Rocks fly through like hailstone. It becomes difficult to keep one’s foot on the ground without solid cover. A growing fire forms as the lit leaves carried by the wind react with the environment, setting ablaze branches, shrubs, and all that can be burned. The flames too get carried, making it dangerous to stand in the open.

His final attack… ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Triboulet took care of Dancer. The Servants were still reaching for that moment to cleanse this war of yet another Servant to tip the scales in their favour. Was this situation better or worse than before he used his Mystic Eyes? It was hard to tell, though the hole in his shoulder had differing opinions about the matter entirely.

The all too sudden departure of Archer by tree allowed his Servant to disarm his opponent, freeing up his arm so he could struggle his way out of this predicament and back on solid ground. Archer, seemingly unharmed, appeared before him to put a stop to any ideas of escaping.

&quot;Gyahh!&quot; Spit and blood landed on Archer&#39;s boot once the weight of a Servant&#39;s might came down on his chest. Something cracked inside of his chest. A rib, perhaps? His breathing was a bit ragged but it was still manageable. He should be fine to continue struggling. Although, the sharp spurs was a damn good deterrent from any further struggling, effectively keeping him down.

Why didn&#39;t he just take the time to kill him right here and now? Did he fear that Triboulet would return the favour to his own Master as well? It wasn&#39;t a thought that had the luxury to linger much longer inside of his mind. What were the odds that these two had a pact made to not harm the other&#39;s Master, anyways?

Fortunately, their eyes never met. What she did see, however, was a small smirk from her Master. One that would have a compliment towards her name follow shortly after seeing it. His position prevented such a thing, though. That was probably for the better. This was the last place and time for James to be acting the fool instead.

Lachlan righting himself back up and firing off a Command Spell took his attention away, reminding him of what they were doing. Damn kid. It was helpful that he was left without his gun thanks to Assassin. That didn&#39;t help his current situation much, though. The damned brat was still a Magus, after all. It wouldn&#39;t take much to take him out in this position, nor could he afford to send him into that dreamscape again either. Just two nails left. He needed to do something with them. Maybe he co-

All James could do was close his eyes and bring up his good arm to shield himself from the bullet. Neither closing his eyes, nor his arm, would be enough to stop the bullet.

She had spent much time considering it, being the rare returning spirit who just couldn&#39;t tell you what they wanted.  The death of all nobility, that would&#39;ve served her vindictive self so well, but what use would it have now?  They were past the time of kings and lords.

She spoke, earnestly and with only a little bit of showboating to mussy up her true feeling.  A normal life is what she wanted.  If Bill could be said to be a positive existence in this world, it&#39;d just be for giving her a reason to make up her mind.  Was this all a ploy to buy time, delay the violence, maybe to get Bill to go a little softer on her?  Yes, but it was <em>honest</em> at the same time.

And what did she get from them for being honest?

Takeru told her to shut up, Lachlan told her to shut up, and Bill basically told her that she shouldn&#39;t have tried at all.

Though she would have far greater problems shortly, they really weren&#39;t helping her sincerity issues.

Bill&#39;s reply stung and it stung hard.  Her already sharp expression grew more terse, her last knife clutched as he, in her ears, called it a bit of forced dramaturgy.  Her eyes swung between him and his Master.  She had no time, and her off-the-cuff rebuke of &quot;I&#39;ll do better at living than you ever could!&quot; didn&#39;t seem...harsh enough to her.

Really, Assassin wanted him to hurt.  Just a little.

The last moment she had to weasel out was the small interval, no more than three seconds, between &#39;with my&#39; - she knew what two words were sure to follow after - and the report of gunfire.  To a man, no time at all.  To a Servant, it could span an entire fight.  To her...<em>not enough.</em>

It must&#39;ve been a hundred half-formed ideas, ways to bend this increasingly aggravating sense of comedy to her favor, that she cycled through in that time.  Nothing could be done.  It really just wasn&#39;t enough time.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139092980511277158 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139092980511277158><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 10, 2023 2:08 AM">2:08 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She was...going to have to kill Lachlan, try futilely to disarm Bill again, or...take it.

The last thing Lachlan heard before the gunshot was a quick, French-accented <strong>&quot;Oh, FUCK YOU!&quot;</strong>

James had a strange half a second before him.  There was a great pain that could&#39;ve been that gunshot, but nothing was pierced.  It was a compressing force, something pushing down on his chest and making the blunt force worse.  Stranger, maybe more painful was the force of being dragged across the ground at <em>incredible</em> speed.  Whiplash was one thing, the trip by itself was another!  So fast did he skate across the dry grass and sandstone paths of the churchyard that the heat of friction alone was a pain, not counting the drubbing as he was made to move over all manner of terrain.

He was looking up into a barrel one moment, and the next at the sky.

It could&#39;ve been Heaven, and this force the sensation of his soul heading on up there, but the sound and feeling of Triboulet coughing blood onto his neck proved otherwise.

She had thrown herself between him and the bullet.  Like a human torpedo she dived head-first with enough momentum to carry James underneath her a good twenty, thirty feet - past Bill and Lachlan, out onto a bare patch of grass.  The last time she had been shot, that was it.  She had to get her ass carried back the entire way and still suffered.  If she didn&#39;t take the blow just now, though, what then?

No time to figure that out, either.

James was forced upward, his Servant moving off him and yanking him by the jacket before Bill could get his bead back on the two.  Triboulet only gave him a cursory glance, visually checking to see that he hadn&#39;t been pierced through along with her, and he&#39;d get a glance back as well.

Half of her lower torso, just below the navel, had been turned a much darker red.  The yellow half of her outfit had become an unhealthy orange.  Triboulet was up, but not well.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139093079433957466 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139093079433957466><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 10, 2023 2:09 AM">2:09 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Another gunshot.  She didn&#39;t give him any commands, verbal or mental, only dragging him - not picking him up this time - by the sleeve, with less speed than she had just exhibited.  Triboulet didn&#39;t even check Bill&#39;s position or if she was being fired at, she was simply running and praying that she didn&#39;t get shot in the once, twice, ten more, how many more times that Bill pulled the trigger.

They had at least somewhere to hide.  A small mausoleum, made into a shelter by Triboulet bashing down the stonework keeping it sealed for the last century, was going to be their stopping place.  There wasn&#39;t much room, as they shared their hideaway with a coffin, but it was enough to sit and be safe.

The gunfire ceased, and there would be a bit of talking outside...and about that time, Triboulet spoke just loud enough for James to hear: &quot;Move over,&quot; she said to the coffin and its resident, &quot;we&#39;ll be needing...this space...soon enough.&quot;

She clutched at her wound.  There were words, magic words, something that bid fell portents towards everyone around them.  She didn&#39;t have time to run further away, or anything like that.  The air grew fiery, and Triboulet closed her eyes.

All of her chances lay in whether this stonework would stay standing...and whether Saber could fuck Bill up just as badly.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

An excellent question, that. The church? It stood precariously to the side, barely holding itself together. The next building was several blocks away, with only a few dozen tombstones in between. The tombstones? Morbidly fitting, but no thanks.

There was a strange pulse in the air. Lachlan saw the canopy of clouds closing in from above, heard the sharp whistling of the wind in his ears. Flecks of golden particles flew off the lone Saber, mingling with an extraordinary surge of mana swirling around him. Lachlan recognized the telltale signs of a Noble Phantasm even if he had only witnessed them a small handful of times. It wasn&#39;t much different from any large scale magecraft, really; if the crackling energy in the air hadn&#39;t clued him in on it, then the violent gale that threatened to sweep him off his feet confirmed it beyond any doubt.

Archer was screaming for him to leave, but the question lingered still. 

<em>Where?</em>

<em>&lt;Escort me yourself,&gt;</em> Lachlan replied loftily. <em>&lt;What good are you if you can&#39;t even muster enough strength to chaperone your Master?&gt;</em>

Assassin had made a sound judgement, hightailing it out of Saber&#39;s immediate vicinity with her tail tucked between her legs and her Master in tow. To expect the same out of the proud and egotistic Bill, however, almost seemed in itself a taunt, a mockery, a provocation...

<em>&lt;Don&#39;t stress your stupid head about it, Archer. I&#39;m not going anywhere.&gt;</em>

And he meant every word, a double entendre. As the leaves transformed into razor sharp projectiles under the influence of the wind, the puppeteer hunched over Leapfrog&#39;s convulsing form. Something glinted in his hand, before it was pressed against the puppet&#39;s spine in a carving motion. Leapfrog&#39;s convulsions grew wilder, then, as if a switch had been flipped, the struggling abruptly ceased.

<em>&lt;So you better uphold your end of the bargain,&gt;</em>

Lachlan waited.

Bill didn&#39;t even care about Assassin saving her Master from death, too focused on Takeru&#39;s injuries to care. If he could kill Saber within the next 20 seconds or so, Assassin&#39;s death was more than guaranteed anyway.

That is, if Takeru made this easy for him.

Clearly, he would not. Archer already sensed that from the shift in the wind. It was normally silent, but now carried a voice: The burning, murderous intent that Saber held towards him. Even if they were destined to lose, they would make sure that Archer couldn&#39;t win either.

Bill scoffed. His opponent was more than welcome to try.

<em>&lt;Are ya stupid?&gt;</em> Archer grumbled in his mind, a bit tired of Lachlan&#39;s games in the midst of the battle. <em>&lt;I can&#39;t save yer ass here if I lose. Ya do realize that?&gt;</em>

Lachlan knew that plenty, but that&#39;s why he stood by Bill&#39;s side. This wasn&#39;t trust or faith, but simply an acknowledgment of Archer&#39;s strength. Why fold when you could raise, knowing that you had the hand of God at your side? Even Bill could understand that.

<em>&lt;Hah. Got meself the thickest Master on the planet.&gt;</em> Bill chuckled, watching as Saber released his Noble Phantasm. His keen eye already clued him on to what was happening: Saber was expiring. His Spirit Origin was burning itself out, as if it had been severed by its mana supply. Lachlan had succeeded in defeating the Master, so no wonder they were acting so confident. A Masterless Servant was no better than a dog.

Surely Bill would not lose to a dog?

<em>&lt;Fine. Ya wanna see? Then you&#39;ll see plenty!&gt;</em> The cowboy boasted, the strong winds pushing him back, the fire burning at his coat, his face singed with residue burns from the sheer power of Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm. Yet he did not move one inch from where he stood.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139296241726005309 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139296241726005309><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 10, 2023 3:36 PM">3:36 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
These injuries would not heal, but that was fine. He already knew that running away wouldn&#39;t save him. How else could he have stared down a dragon and won? Saber looked so insignificant in comparison.

What did he have to fear?

&quot;Nice trick, Saber,&quot; Bill said in the face of a flying tree, narrowly dodging it by shifting to his side. &quot;but I&#39;ve been through worse weather. How &#39;bout you? I&#39;d feel like total shit if <strong>my Master had died.&quot;</strong> Zero subtlety behind his words, just petty gloating at still having skin in the game.

&quot;Yer nothing more than a spoiled pup throwing a tantrum now. Can&#39;t even win the Grail, ya idiot.&quot; Archer giggled, despite feeling the heat reach his bones. This wasn&#39;t even the full impact of Saber&#39;s blow, but merely the residue. He only had a second left before Takeru&#39;s slash reached him. A second was...

<strong>Four hundred and fourteen bullets.</strong>

He would resort to that move again, locking himself away from his Noble Phantasm. Ballad of Cherokee Bill was only good out of combat, anyway. The moment his target got up and personal, he couldn&#39;t rely on his old tricks anymore. He needed brute force and brute force alone.

A true <em>Desperado.</em>

<em>&lt;Remember this, brat. This is who Cherokee Bill was.&gt;</em>

Two guns raised, yet his legs remained immobile. There was no point in running away from such a Noble Phantasm. It would dull his aim, since dodging simply wasted time. Instead, he would use whatever moments he had left to hit Saber in all of his critical spots. Weak points that the Servant wasn&#39;t even aware of, clues given to him by their fading Spirit Origin. The sooner he could sever any connection to the Spiritron Core, the better for him.

The Sun rose up, meeting the very centre of the battlefield. The church bell rang, since the clock had struck its most important hour.

It was high noon.

Bullets so quick that Saber didn&#39;t even hear them shoot. A dozen in his chest, around thirty or so directed at his knees. Fifty aimed for his sword, trying their best to sever Takeru&#39;s hand and his sword with it. Bill&#39;s last ditch attempt to negate the full extent of Takeru&#39;s Noble Phantasm.

The remaining hundred or so bullets? All aimed for Saber&#39;s face. Eyes, nose, lips, brain and even hair. No stone was left unturned. No body part too irrelevant to ignore.

Did Bill actually miss a point-blank shot?!

That was the thought that went through his head once he saw the situation before him. Saber unleashing his Noble Phantasm while Archer faced him off in a standoff. Triboulet saw it best to carry him away from the conflict. Seeing the state of the area around those two, it was probably for the best. James had no way to defend himself if he was caught in the middle of all that.

It was only when they stopped did James notice that she literally took a bullet for him as her outfit received a new unsightly paint job. If he had the time, healing it would have been a simple task. Time, however, wasn&#39;t something they had the luxury, or the abundance, of. 

&quot;This better not be some twisted way of us digging our own graves! This place barely fits one coffin, let alone two more!&quot; As the outside of the small mausoleum burned away from Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm, James yelled so his voice could be heard.

I&#39;ve got us!&quot; With his good arm, James slammed his palm against the mausoleum&#39;s wall as a flash of bright blue shined from the centre of his palm. The creeping light began to cover as much of the mausoleum as his mana would allow. A <strong>Reinforcement</strong> Spell wasn&#39;t going to much against a Noble Phantasm, if struck directly. What it did do was protect them against the debris that came as a result, however. After that last ditch effort to preserve their lives, he kept his eyes closed shut until everything died down.

If she was willing to take a bullet for him, this was the least he could do for them in return.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139327916023496774 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139327916023496774><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, August 10, 2023 5:42 PM">5:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The cowboy shoots into the flames in an attempt to kill him. Thinking that killing him would weaken or maybe end his Noble Phantasm. Fortunately, or perhaps, unfortunately, he’s already gone. Sometimes, it’s too late to do anything about something. This is one of those times.

The skin is pricked by splinters and cut by thin leaves. The harsh winds make it difficult to open one’s eyes. These are but minor issues, there is nothing stopping one from shrugging it off as if it were nothing.

That is until the flames swallowed them whole.

The pain becomes overwhelming. The skin is burnt with the exposing flesh black. The muscles can’t help but tense up and flex. The fabric of their wear is set ablaze. There is nothing to breathe but the fire and its smoke. A horrifying feeling that lasted until the nerves themselves were burnt off.

Nothing can be felt, and then the winds calmed down.

There is no trace of the swordsman. His figure, his voice, his presence, he is gone. He had exhausted himself and there was nothing left to keep him from passing. However, the aftermath of his act can be observed. Clear sky, trees fallen, smoke dissipating, soot stains, displaced stone, pulled shrubs, and all that.

For one person in particular, he can feel it all. The cowboy had  endured the late Saber’s attack in the open though he had suffered greatly. Parts of him tremble while the rest is numb. His skin burnt off and his tender flesh visible. His tense and quivering muscles makes moving difficult.

Takeru has ultimately failed. His foe had come out on top while he was defeated. Bill may have lived but he had been roughed up severely. All it takes now is for someone to finish him off. ≣</span></div></div></div></div></div>

No...to call it a &#39;racket&#39; was a disservice to Bill.  He had taken those guns of his and made a thunderstorm.  It rolled, beating at her eardrums with a fury that she imagined was only met by the joy Bill must&#39;ve felt in those moments.

The man was keen on violence.  In indulging so voraciously in it, he must&#39;ve felt nothing short of <em>euphoria.</em>  Shooting, and killing, and not being denied it through nonsense and trickery...

Some small part of her envied just how base he lived.  In that moment she was scared, in pain, and he was having the time of his life.

The gunshots were enough to silence James despite shouting right in her ear.  His power prevented what would&#39;ve been a very ignominious death, as the stone walls around them managed to stay in place, and mostly intact.  At some point, the roof had sheared off from the forces about them.  The unusual day-in-night sky that manifested from the outlaw&#39;s Noble Phantasm was only barely visible past the smoke, waving heat and cinders clouding the air that wafted down into the mausoleum.

And then, for a moment, it was all-but silent.  The trees about them crackled with fire and parts of the church broke off out of time with the rest of the destruction, but there were no more gunshots, no wind and nothing else.

At the same time as his Servant, James could feel one of the lights of mana go out beyond the wall they hid behind.  It was one that burned for as long as it could, but whatever had gone on beyond their vision had left it extinguished.  Triboulet...well, she hoped it would be Archer, but she doubted it.  In all likelihood, this was the finale.  One and one.

...if only it weren&#39;t for the horned one, who had let them all kill each other while he burnt his tongue on tea...god dammit.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139671297719283833 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139671297719283833><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 4:26 PM">4:26 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Played us all like a fiddle, he did.  If she lived fighting Bill and died against him, as long as she made the thieving bastard regret sparing her, that would be enough.

Triboulet stirred, and rose.  She clutched her stomach tight and suppressed the sounds of pain that she wanted to make.  With that mass expenditure of mana on Bill&#39;s part, if she didn&#39;t act as soon as she could, she was only making it more unlikely...

...but what <em>could</em> she act upon?  Killing Lachlan?  Trying to come up with some kind of insane gag that protected her as she closed the distance between them, and then...cutting his head off, or something?  He had just survived being crushed to death by a tree, so his endurance must be far in excess of hers.  Maybe that wouldn&#39;t be enough.

Why did she have to be right when she said she was the shittiest Servant alive?  Immortality means nothing if you&#39;ve no ability to act in the world.  What a lame joke to be played on her.

For a moment, her mind didn&#39;t race like it had before.  She just, simply, felt like there were no options set before her.

...except <strong>one.</strong>

God, would it come down to that?  If she was throwing that way, she might as well call the fight against the Horned Rider right then.  Better to walk out, stand in the flames until she baked and give him some french toast to go along with his tea than try to fight him...maybe even unarmed...

&quot;...better that than giving that redhead what he wants,&quot; she said aloud.

&quot;James,&quot; she leaned back and slowly pushed herself up the wall.  &quot;I&#39;m going to attempt something...very much becoming of a fool.  With it, I might, <em>might</em> succeed against him.  If he isn&#39;t taken out by this, well, I suppose he deserves to be the victor for being so goddamned hard to kill.&quot;

She looked down at him on the ground.  Her eyes made her internal doubt obvious, and the way she spoke carried an air of finality that made it sound as much like a goodbye as planning out tactics.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139671337925873754 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139671337925873754><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 4:27 PM">4:27 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>&quot;And if he doesn&#39;t die...or, hell, if he <em>does</em> and someone takes advantage of our weakness...that&#39;ll be it.

I&#39;ll be...throwing away the one trump card that&#39;s gotten us through all of this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be...well.  I suppose I wouldn&#39;t even be a jester after all of that.  I&#39;d simply be an assassin holding a knife.&quot;

&quot;Wish me luck if you feel like you don&#39;t need all of it to yourself.&quot;  Triboulet held out her last knife in front of her, running a finger along its flat edge as she considered its tarnished surface.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was over and Archer was left standing in the end. Damn. If that bastard could withstand something like that and still be standing, what hope does a knife have? 

The looming sense of dread fell over James. As much as they managed to fumble their way to the finale, they were outmatched. In both Master and Servant. 

What&#39;s a man to do rather than smile at a time like this? His head rested against the wall of the mausoleum; his eyes set upon the sky for what could be his very last moments on this earth.

Their backs were up against the wall in this scenario. Whatever action they chose to do needed to be their best. There was a sinking feeling inside of his chest that their best might not be enough in face of such opponents, though. A doubt that weighed too much to be cast aside by sheer optimism. No matter how much he tried to scrape together for the both of them.

James never saw himself returning if he lost. Even if it meant his death, there was nothing stopping him from attempting to grasp at the grail with his last remaining bit of strength. So, with one of the last Silver Nails being grasped in his hand, James prepared to make one last dash towards Lachlan. The odds were abysmal with Bill still kicking but it was better than just accepting defeat.

His eyes returned to her; curious to what she had to say.

Upon hearing her plan, all the man could do was scoff with a smile. &quot;And? An Assassin with a knife was all I needed. The immortality shtick just happened to be a nice bonus on top of it all.&quot; James spoke as the Silver Nail was lowered. If this is what she wanted then running out with her just complicate things. 

The metallic tang rung in the air as he ended up dropping the Nail. His hand was placed over the wound so he could pour what Mana he could into her. It wouldn&#39;t heal the wound completely but he hoped to at least stifle the bleeding for her. 

&quot;We managed to drag our asses this far without using it, haven&#39;t we? Who says we actually need it in that case then?&quot; After he poured what he could, he stared at the back of his hand as he was about to pull away. The Command Spells he had was down to one. Something he intended to save for the last moment of this war. However, all that was running through his mind wasn&#39;t the contingency plan he had saved. Instead, it was just how he could use this body of the butterfly that remained to grant Triboulet that extra push.

&quot;I can offer something better than just luck, <strong>Nicolette</strong>.&quot; With a smirk, the last Command Spell on his hand started to glow. &quot;<strong>With the power of my last Command Spell, I order you...</strong>&quot; This was it. Their final gambit. All of his hopes and trust was placed upon her shoulder the moment he completed that final passage, and he spoke it with utter certainty. &quot;<em><strong>to finish off Archer, and end this war once and for all!!!</strong></em>&quot;

This was it.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139689255363428413 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139689255363428413><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 5:38 PM">5:38 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

She feared she would be nothing after this, either in death or ineffectuality...but if he thought that it was merely a convenience of the moment, to be expended when most opportune, that would work.  It would!  And with it, Triboulet would feel resolve pour into her, where doubt was before.

His Command Seal invigorated her, pushing her to her absolute limit, but it only strengthened what she had before.

In her hand, she pulled out the other thing left in her sheathe.  Lindwyrm&#39;s claw, still dark at its tip with the unholy blood of the beast of sin, was larger than her hand.  It had weighed down heavily all these days, never seeing use again...and it&#39;d be gone before it could.  Triboulet started to absorb the mana left in its form, and it began to crumble to nothing.

It seemed like it was about time.  Latching onto the words of a long-dead king that she hated more than anyone had served her well, but she would find out if she had grown enough to be more than that.  By victory or by a bullet, more than a little footnote of history who only had fame for dodging the headsman&#39;s axe so deftly.

Triboulet held up the knife, and let it block away the sun.  Her mind didn&#39;t come up with any witticisms to intone into its refashioning, and maybe she knew that it was past the time for that.  All she could think about was a reversal.

&quot;...by the patron saints, Nitouche, Pansard...let me move on without your protection.  In the name of the king, <em>Restaurateur des Lettres,</em> I ask to be released from this proclamation of ours with no hope of restitution.&quot;

&quot;Let the king reign forevermore, unamused,&quot; she spoke out loud.  Archer, standing outside, would hear her say it, and with that the fight would commence into what would hopefully be its last moments.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139690396868411542 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139690396868411542><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 5:42 PM">5:42 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>The knife flashed with a burst of golden light as mana poured into it - Triboulet&#39;s, the disintegrating black nail of Lindwyrm, and all but every drop that James could offer.  Its length became a sterling silver shaft that stood far longer than she did, and at its peak a black crescent, wholly absorbing the light of the western sun, formed and sat menacingly.

Everything was put into this one blow of hers, a destruction of all that she was, hoping to destroy all that Bill is.

She took a deep breath, holding the poleaxe in both hands, and she shouted over the wall: <strong>&quot;Cherokee Bill!</strong>  <em>For all that you&#39;ve done for me, name how you would wish to die!&quot;</em>

What kind of pompous nonsense was she on about?  What, did she really think she had something on him?  She had fought him before, and she was slippery but that was it.  It would be a hot day in Hell to see her get him, even in his state.

Triboulet waited for as long as it took him to answer, and then bolted.  The blow itself came violently, for as soon as the words left his lips, she launched herself around the corner and toward him in a second bound.  James would be thrown off his feet from the force of her passing, the smoke and the fire would be pushed aside with the wind running on her coattail, and in her hands was a fell weapon that she held at her side.

In her eyes, full intent to kill.  In that moment of time, the axe swung and found itself aimed true.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Persistent, yet dying out in pain. It was evident that Gloria had already left this world, leaving her Servant with nothing more than base commands and a limited mana supply. This would be his final attack.

And it hit like a truck.

Bill&#39;s bullets had already chewed through Saber&#39;s body, or whatever was left of them at least. Takeru was no longer a threat. The flaming slash he had left behind, on the other hand, was quite the nuisance. No amount of bullets could hold it back, nor could Bill dodge it in time now that he had activated <em>Desperado.</em>

He grit his teeth, flashed a smile, and took it head on. He had already told Lachlan to bear witness to his greatness. Who was he to chicken out now?!

First, his coat disintegrated. Then, parts of his clothes. After that, his skin. Layers and layers of Bill&#39;s being were gradually eroded by the intense amounts of heat and energy in the air, the result of Saber&#39;s dying wish. Despite the pain, he stood firm, Lachlan watching as their Servant gradually shrunk down from the amount of flesh and skin that was being burnt by the second.

After a few seconds of tortuous hellfire, the Noble Phantasm finally vanished, no doubt caused by Takeru&#39;s untimely disappearance. This was a boon for Bill, who wondered if he would have even been able to resist the Noble Phantasm in the first place had Saber not died beforehand. It was a mystery that he would rather leave open ended, since it was better than the alternative of admitting that Saber could have potentially beaten him.

&quot;See...? What did I tell ya...?&quot; Bill groaned, his speech slurred thanks to singed lips and charred jaws. Lachlan could barely hear him, forcing the Servant to resort back to telepathy.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139709014708605020 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139709014708605020><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 6:56 PM">6:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;This enough of a bargain for ya? I&#39;d say I passed yer test with flying colours.&gt;</em> Bill gloated, savouring his victory, until that sixth sense of his warned him of incoming danger.

Another Servant was still around, after all. The slippery kind, which was especially troublesome to deal with. Archer would be caught off guard as Triboulet appeared, making herself known and having armed herself with an axe-like weapon. She called Bill out, asking for what sort of fate he thought he deserved.

&quot;Gods, yer obsessed. How &#39;bout just taking me out for drinks?&quot; Bill chuckled, coughing out coal from his polluted lunges. He was surprised he was still conscious, let alone standing. Triboulet&#39;s charge at him felt like a dream, since he felt completely spent after the previous scuffle with Saber. But the sane part of his brain prodded his mind, warning him that he faltered now, then he would never get to succeed at his goal. He didn&#39;t have the luxury to slack off now of all times.

&quot;How do I wish to die?&quot; Archer grinned, sheepishly raising his gun towards his opponent, who inched closer with every passing second. &quot;Old. With a hot wife and like 30 kids or so. I&#39;m afraid ya don&#39;t exactly meet the <em>&#39;hot&#39;</em> category.&quot; He laughed to himself, keeping his distance as his gun was now primed to fire.

<em>&lt;Hey, kid.&gt;</em> Despite focusing on Triboulet&#39;s movements, Bill kept the line open for his Master. <em>&lt;I got a bad feeling about this. Like I&#39;ve been here before.&gt;</em> He saw flashes of his past. The events that led to his capture, imprisonment and eventual death. A creeping sense of deja vu started to fill his conscience. His body had already accepted his potential demise.

And just like last time, he would meet Death smiling, with a gun in his hand. If Death wanted him, they would have to take him first.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139709075517612042 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139709075517612042><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Friday, August 11, 2023 6:56 PM">6:56 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;If I die here, ya can save yer bitchin&#39; and complaints for the after life. Focus on getting the Grail first.&gt;</em> He ordered, as if telling Lachlan to carry on in his stead. <em>&lt;I&#39;m gonna look real silly if I&#39;m overreacting, but hey. Momma always told me to live life with zero regrets.&gt;</em>

His gun faced Triboulet&#39;s chest. They were mere moments apart, with her axe just a few feet away from his neck.

<strong>BANG! BANG! BANG!</strong>

An entire magazine poured over, aimed for Triboulet&#39;s chest, stomach, arms and legs. He spared no expense in trying to kill the Assassin once and for all.

Though, if he had failed, then there was no telling what would happen next. Triboulet was inches away from hitting him, after all. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

The second bullet scraped across her side, adding yet another scar to remember her by.  The next three missed, and each was by the smallest of degrees that felt as if they were impossible.  His gun reported again and again, and each bounding step brought her closer, escaping serious harm.

Her Noble Phantasm was gone.  She had no guarantee to life anymore.  It would be a moot point, but in the end, it was all...luck.  Pure, unadulterated, bullshit luck, that allowed her to close the gap.  Her heart beat so violently that it might give out, as even she didn&#39;t believe that it would be possible for this to end this way.

The last bullet, aimed when she was so close she could be spat upon, would&#39;ve hit her head square on - blowing her brains out and ending her in one go, unlike Saber.  This last one missed not for good fortune, but because she simply stepped to the left.

In the space that was occupied by the assassin came the black blade of the axe.

It reached Bill, and its mass turned from an inky black to a brilliant white that beat out the desert sun in brightness.  Archer found himself and his intuition entirely right, in the end - this was going to be it.  With a turn of her wrist to face up, the axe head curled to meet him and kiss his neck before detonating its store of mana, and he faced an execution one more time.

Triboulet, made the executioner on her own accord...did not give him a look of pity in the last blink of time he had.  He&#39;d never want that.

The explosion was incredible, its sound terrible enough to deafen anyone remotely nearby.  All of the power of her Noble Phantasm concentrated in a severing detonation that, if it wouldn&#39;t behead the outlaw, would simply blow him to pieces.  Triboulet herself was thrown by its force and sent across the graveyard, bouncing off a tree with enough force to snap its trunk before crashing back first into the wall of the church itself.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139798669701415033 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139798669701415033><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 12:52 AM">12:52 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She slid down, and came to a complete stillness at its base.  No movement came at first and it would be easy to imagine she was dead herself, the victim of her suicidal charge - her jesterly garb was burnt, her right sleeve blown free and the skin underneath burnt, the frill about her neck had come off entirely and lay smoldering elsewhere, and her hat would never be seen again.  Triboulet&#39;s face received its fair share of singing, marred on its right side...

...and she thought to herself that maybe she <em>had</em> died, really.  After all, there couldn&#39;t be anything so ironic as what Bill had requested.  It <em>had</em> to be a hallucination at the brink of consciousness.

It was unintentional, undoubtedly, as it was nothing he had ever asked and there was no doubt in her mind that Bill would never bother researching her.  The pure irony of it all, to be met with the same request she made so long ago, was unbelievable to her.  She&#39;d throw out that line, for it would suspend the disbelief of the idiotic audiences of Paris too much to bear.

When she opened her eyes, finding herself alive, in one piece...and Bill no longer standing...that was all disproven.  It was real.  Bill&#39;s death - and her <strong>victory</strong> - was simply the longest gap between the start of the joke and the punchline she had ever delivered.

Triboulet laughed.  Bitterly and with pain, not all physical, but she laughed nonetheless.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Bill struggled to put himself in this situation; an ant like Triboulet would never have the chance of harm him. It was only due to Saber&#39;s self-destructive sacrifice that she was able to approach him in the first place.

And even if she could, did it matter? He could take a stab or two, and in the time it took for her to do all that, he could think of at least twenty different holes to fill in her. But this time, things were different. This time, Triboulet had a weapon on her, one that he had never seen in his life.

It reminded him of a noose. He could hear the clock ticking and the bell tolling, calling for him.

Not now. Not this instant. He could deal with death in his past, when his life mattered as much as excrement, but now-

<em>&lt;I got a bad feeling about this. Like I&#39;ve been here before.&gt;</em>

-All he could do was maintain his cool. He cracked a few jokes. Reassured Lachlan that he still had things under control.

<em>&lt;If I die here, ya can save yer bitchin&#39; and complaints for the after life. Focus on getting the Grail first. I&#39;m gonna look real silly if I&#39;m overreacting, but hey. Momma always told me to live life with zero regrets.&gt;</em>

Yeah, right. He was scared shitless. He didn&#39;t want things to end. He didn&#39;t want to fail again. 

Hope vanished in his soul as he saw Assassin dodge the next volley of bullets. Scraping, but never hitting. Was it because one of his eyes had been burned out completely? Was it because his flesh was melting, wrists almost falling off from their handles?

Or was it just dumb luck?

The closer she got, the more he prepared himself. One shot. One shot would end this. All he had to do was keep firing and never stop, don&#39;t give her the idea that you&#39;re preparing for her to get closer. Let her come to you. Her face was incredibly close.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139917165835853904 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139917165835853904><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 8:43 AM">8:43 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>BANG!</em>

He missed. She predicted his shot, and moved to the left. Unlucky.

<em>&lt;God fucking damn-&gt;</em> Bill didn&#39;t finish that, as the axe hit his neck and the world went dark.

...

By the time he regained consciousness, a whole minute had passed since the explosion. He was woken up by laughter, coming from a familiar voice that resembled the cross between a chicken and a hyena. He couldn&#39;t see them though, since he was completely covered in rubble.

<em>stump thump</em>

He shoved the rocks aside, slowly emerging from where he once stood. Assassin would definitely get a scare, so would Lachlan once he saw the state of his Servant.

&quot;Stop laughing, ya dumb bitch. I&#39;m still-&quot;

Bill then realized that his vision was upside down. After all, his head was dangling 90 degrees, the neck being around halfway cut. It was a miracle he was still conscious and alive, let alone standing.

&quot;-breathing.&quot; He cracked a smile, despite knowing how pathetic he looked. He grabbed his skull, lifting it up and holding it in place, now seeing things a lot clearer (and in the correct alignment). With his free hand, he reached for his pistol and lifted it.

The moment he did, his hand trembled. It was singed, bloodied and he could see it to the bone. He struggled to control his trigger finger, as if the nerves to it had been severed.

<em>&lt;Hello? Heals? I could use some, ya know?!&gt;</em> Bill thumped on Lachlan&#39;s door, but his tone betrayed him. It was obvious that even he knew that no amount of a Master&#39;s healing Magecraft would fix his current state.

Spitefully, he trudged on, inching closer to Triboulet&#39;s location at the rate of a snail.

&quot;Bet ya don&#39;t find this funny at all. Should have double tapped me, ya dumb-&quot; He stumbled on a rock.

<em>thud</em>

It didn&#39;t even take anything for him to fall. He dropped the gun, almost willingly. If he hadn&#39;t, he would have fallen flat on his face.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139917215760666644 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139917215760666644><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 8:44 AM">8:44 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
<em>&lt;Goddamnit.&gt;</em> There was some frustration to his voice. He must have realized it by now, that his body was slowly disintegrating into particles. Starting with his nerves, restricting his movement and constricting his breathing. <em>&lt;Sorry, kid.

Fingers dug into Bill&#39;s scalp next, seizing his unruly hair and tugging it like oiled chains. Lachlan yanked Bill&#39;s head back, twisting it a full 90 degrees from its severed position, and whispered in a surprisingly steady voice, &#39;Listen. If you ever decide to ditch this War, with or without the Grail—&#39;

He slammed Bill&#39;s head back onto the bleeding stump.

&#39;—You put in a request first. Have I ever granted you permission to leave?&#39;

Death, a terminal illness. Bill&#39;s heart continued to palpitate, lungs continued to expand and contract, but those actions were merely illusory, as his life had reached its end...

A few parting words, then: they were all that was left in store for his Master. It would be a simple ritual, performed to offer the dying cowboy a moment&#39;s reprieve—a small gesture of comfort, a premium shot of morphine injected straight into his veins. But much like morphine, those words could only ever ease his passage. They would not prevent the inevitable.

Nevertheless, such gestures carried weight; those fortunate enough to die serenaded by words of grief were blessed indeed. They wouldn&#39;t face death alone, but rather accompanied by affection and tears, by trust and lament. Lament his demise, then! In these fleeting moments, allow the cowboy to bask in the warmth of compassion, so that he could depart this world without regrets, bid his <em>adieu</em> in serenity...

Yet, cold fingers bore into his chest, gripping his heart and forcing it to constrict. Resuscitation? No, nothing like that. The fingers simply refused to release him from his suffering.

A length of sharp metal burrowed into his flesh, followed by crude stitches that sealed the gash and forced his head to perch upright upon the bleeding stump.

&#39;Don&#39;t you dare shed a tear over your own goddamned words,&#39; Lachlan delivered a hard slap to Bill&#39;s neck, before burying the needle deep into the flesh along with the final length of thread. The last stroke of his Command Spell weighed heavily on the nape of his own neck.

Lachlan stood above the prone Knight. He stood there, breath steady, back erect, gaze hardened as he watched trees tumble and tombstones crumble in the aftermath of the explosion.

&#39;With my third, and final Command Spell,&#39; he wrung the words like a curse around the cowboy&#39;s neck. &#39;<strong>Pull yourself together, Cherokee Bill.</strong> You have yet to escort me out.&#39;</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1139998416710156399 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1139998416710156399><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 2:06 PM">2:06 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

It was no different than being hanged, just with some tortuous length to it. Suffocating on a rope was mercy in comparison.

But instead of accelerating his death, he kept struggling. Could he get one more shot in? One last bullet directed towards Assassin&#39;s Master? He knew that Lachlan was a resourceful man. So long as he could at least get rid of the last Master standing, then surely Lachlan would be eligible to-

<em>rrrrip</em>

Someone dragged at his hair, giving him old memories of his pissed off mother. His neck was falling, twisted and lacerated from Triboulet&#39;s Broken Phantasm. The person holding him, however, was kind enough to keep him straight.

&quot;The hell are ya doing, brat?&quot; The voice and snarky tone gave them away, along with their ridiculous demands. What the hell were they thinking, ordering a corpse around? It was obvious at this stage that Bill wouldn&#39;t survive for long. Yet Lachlan insisted on getting closer, to the point he angrily clutched at Bill&#39;s chest in frustration, forcing the cowboy to look down at his Master.

&quot;Ya already know what&#39;s gonna happen, so ya better hightail it outta h-<strong>OW!&quot;</strong> Bill screamed, feeling the needle penetrate his throat. It hurt a lot more while you were dying, he soon found, as Lachlan pushed him to the ground and commenced his surgery. His neck wiggled and wobbled, returning to its proper form as it was now covered in stitches. Mana coursed through, along with a final command. It dangled over him tighter than a noose.

&quot;Are you for real...?&quot; Bill grumbled, parts frustrated and parts just straight up confused. &quot;Of all the things ya could have used it for, it&#39;s this?&quot; He asked an unexpected question, almost as if he had been hoping for Lachlan to use the final Command Spell in a more vindictive manner. Take out the enemy with you. Fire one last shot. Something befitting of a weapon.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140036439766216795 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140036439766216795><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 4:37 PM">4:37 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em> </em>
Instead, he was being treated as a butler. Something that didn&#39;t fit him at all. It ticked him off.

Well, he was going to die either way, so he might as well have some fun with it. Slightly rejuvenated from the surgery and the Command Spell&#39;s mana, Cherokee Bill stood up, tall and proud as he usually was. He looked down at his Master and sized him up, as usual.

&quot;Perfect excuse to let me die on a highlight, and ya don&#39;t take it? Bah!&quot; Archer scoffed. &quot;Yer a proper party pooper, boss. Well, yer house, yer rules. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

Bill reached for Lachlan&#39;s leg, then their shoulder. Despite his waning strength and fucked up body, he still managed to lift up his Master with ease. He carried him over the shoulder like a fireman, being a bit too tired (and annoyed) to do a proper princess carry. Just in case Lachlan protested, he kept the man&#39;s arse right next to his shoulder. An emergency drum to slap and calm down the baby.

&quot;Good luck, ya fucking <em>whore.&quot;</em> Bill spat, turning around as he saluted a lone shadow lying in the scorched earth of the church&#39;s graveyard. It was Triboulet, still reeling from the aftermath of the fight. &quot;Buy me a drink once you&#39;ve got the Grail.&quot;

He then left, walking away with his Master in tow. Assassin could already tell: This would be the last time she ever saw Cherokee Bill. <span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

There was barely enough inside of him to keep his eyes open. To think that he thought that summoning a Servant the most taxing thing he has ever done. This absolute exhaustion was on another level. While he still had some left after summoning her, this left him with nothing at all.

A blink was all it took before James realized the side of his face was resting against the ground. <em>&#39;Shit...&#39;</em> He thought to himself. Thankfully he didn&#39;t black out for long. Just for a few seconds from the look of things.

Just in time to witness Archer raising from the dead. &quot;Oh you&#39;ve got to be kidding...&quot; But, luck was their side. It was merely the work of that damn puppeteer. Whatever the brat did, the clock on Archer&#39;s timer was halted. Who knows for how long, though. A sigh of relief left the exhausted man once he saw both of them begin to depart. 

&quot;Nicolette!&quot; Upon the departure of the dead man walking with his Master, James forced himself up off the ground and ran towards his Servant. His body screamed and cursed at him with a searing pain throughout his muscles for doing anything but walking. Any doubt or fear left him once she began to laugh which slowed his approach. A good omen that she was okay, or that she finally went insane.

I think even I looked better at death&#39;s door than you do right now.&quot; 

One final Silver Nail was in his possession right now. From what he read, the Grail needed the energy of <em>every</em> Servant summoned to work. It would be a simple task to take her out right here and now. Except the next thing he did was simply pick her up off the ground. One arm went under her legs and the other against her back; a textbook princess carry. A direct contrast compared to the other pair. 

&quot;I ain&#39;t got enough to heal you after that little stunt so just bare with this for now, alright? We&#39;re almost there.&quot; God he was fortunate that she didn&#39;t weight as much or a few steps was all he was going to be able to muster. It was a blessing that they happened to fight right outside the Church as well. James didn&#39;t need to walk much further. So, with his back turned away from Lachlan, he started the march inside.

There was no final words spoken between the two remaining Masters. This was the last time their destinies would ever cross so there was no need to say anything, of course.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140095322903826443 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140095322903826443><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, August 12, 2023 8:31 PM">8:31 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>

Her laughter subsided, drawn to a shallow noise and then silence.  That Bill, that bastard without equal <em>was alive!</em>

She pulled herself along the wall, her arm rioting in pain against being dragged against the wall - she was defenseless, her mind then turned to arming herself against him, <em>somehow</em> finding anything at hand.  No daggers, no claw, so she took a piece of broken-off branch by her side and prayed it was as sharp as it looked.  Triboulet held it up, and...only then did she see him in his sad state.  

He was breathing, alright.  She could practically see the charred end of his severed windpipe contract as it vainly grasped for air.  Moving slower than ever, his body blasted and only held together as a testament to how damn tough he was.

Then, all threat vanished from him, as but a simple stone managed to pull him over.  The same thug that killed Saber, a fighter strong enough to blow apart a building with nothing but his furious strikes, had become weak enough to be nothing before her.  He was right on the money - even for an enemy, she grit her teeth and frowned with sympathy for him.  &quot;I&#39;m afraid not, Bill,&quot; she replied as he sat there, disarmed and pathetic.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Her own arm, raised as if the threat of a single shard of wood would&#39;ve kept him away, slumped over soon after.  She could&#39;ve gone over and done as he implicitly requested, to kill him and be rid of him, to let him depart quickly instead of falling to dust...but she couldn&#39;t.

How easy it comes to murder in a burst of violence, versus a drawn out and painful death?  Hell, just to watch it occur in front of you, and to have your indecision be all that keeps it ongoing.  

This woman had been at the side of the dying all too often.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140190063414743070 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140190063414743070><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 13, 2023 2:48 AM">2:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>Lachlan wasn&#39;t helping things.  She had hoped he&#39;d be kind enough to do the job that she couldn&#39;t, and she thought his sharp exclamation of pain was going to be it - but no, she could see him be put into an almost workable state.  Death delayed just to make him work a little longer.  With Archer rising in shambles, Assassin had it in her to hoarsely spit out a little venom at Lachlan&#39;s backside:  &quot;Oh, let the man <em>rest,</em> you little bastard!  And you had the gall to complain about our story...making it worse with an ending like this.&quot;

She tried to move to her feet soon after Bill did, stumbling after him and his asshole of a Master.  Her back was often hunched before, but now it was positively crooked with the blowback of her Broken Phantasm, and she fell forward soon after.  It wouldn&#39;t be enough to keep her down for long...but maybe it was okay to rest briefly.  Just a minute or two.

As Bill left, carrying his charge with the last bit of energy he was granted, Triboulet writhed, trying to get a look at him.  She pulled her neck up with a loud crack, just at the right moment to catch his salute after his profane well-wish.

The man had tried to kill her, just about did on two occasions, and had just called her a whore.

The strange realization that she didn&#39;t care as much as she could&#39;ve kept her from saying something profound.

He was...well, he was the only one she got to know out of all of these dead men.  To see him end up like this made her feel off.  Maybe just sympathetic for a devil of a man.

Bill had taken a lot from her, but a well-wish of her own would be the last thing he took:  &quot;I will!  And...and you were as cool as Shaft...for a minute there.&quot;

It made <em>her</em> feel pathetic to try and play to his emotions like that, in such a base way and for such a base story, but who cared.  He was dead...and she was probably going to join him soon.

Two Servants down, one to go.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140190204334972990 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140190204334972990><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 13, 2023 2:48 AM">2:48 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>She almost didn&#39;t react when her name, her birth name, had been called out.  From Bill&#39;s backside to James&#39; face she turned, his worn features highlighted in dull orange by the still-smoldering fires, shadowed by the night that returned with Bill&#39;s conjured wild west dissipating.  She gave him a smile, pained as it was.

&quot;I&#39;ve barely done but fail to behead a man,&quot; she said, stopping to cough.  &quot;The other one over there&#39;s doing a better job of standing.&quot;

Carried - and feeling a bit silly that <em>she</em> was the one being cradled to safety for once - her smile dissipated soon after.  James was left to carry her in silence for a minute, past the scene of devastation left in the three Servants&#39; wake, because she took that long to decide to give him the bad news.

It wasn&#39;t going to go well, she knew.  He imagined he had just won it all, and she&#39;d have to tell him otherwise.

Passing under a tree that had been cut down the middle by Takeru&#39;s razor wind, Triboulet closed her eyes.  &quot;There&#39;s another left, James.&quot;

&quot;When we first came here, there were...Takeru and Bill, but also a third.  A horned man, and his Master...and I&#39;m pretty sure they were the pigs who ruined the store while we were out.&quot;  She could imagine the shock, then disappointment he would show.  All this effort just to have the enemy win by doing nothing.  No need to see his face for herself.

&quot;I can walk.  I can...try my best at it,&quot; she said, making an attempt to sound hopeful.  Her small body lightly trembled in his hands.  &quot;They looked like a couple of ponces - I don&#39;t fear them.&quot;</span></div></div></div></div></div>

Once it wears off, not even that puppeteer could keep him alive long enough for it to matter. If anything he is just using him as a tool to keep us off his back, as sad as that is for Archer.&quot; It was a sad truth but there was nothing he could do in the state he was in. What mattered was that they&#39;ve won. With that in his mind, he didn&#39;t mind if the walk into the Church was a silent one. 

When the news came from her about the two remaining participants, James stopped and stared at the Church, not as a podium for making it this far but now as a final wall to climb. This time he lacked the energy to even walk up to it. How in the world was he going to make it over with her in a similar state as him?

His whole body relaxed. A sign of giving up? Why keep fighting when they rung themselves dry just making it to this point? Before she fell from his arms, James tensed up again and readjusted his grip.

&quot;So, we can&#39;t even run away to rest up then? If they already knew where we stayed then it was pointless to waste the energy on running.&quot; So they are the ones who stole his cigarettes, he thought to himself as he gazed up at the sky once more. This was a masterful play on their part. They didn&#39;t realize that they were beset on all sides until it was too late to back out. It was damn impressive to say the least.

Just when he thought he made it too...

The soft depression of his shoe stepping into the ground was the next sound to crack the silence after her request to walk. James was continuing their path into the Church with a somber expression on his face.

&quot;Well, if they got us by the throat then why keep them waiting. Might as well get this over with if we&#39;re already dead, right?&quot; He gave her a soft smile, as if he accepted that his time was over. No fight left in this man. Was this really how he was going out? After all of that talk about saving his daughter? He was willing to just give up so easily at the sight of one more obstacle? <strong>Of course not.</strong>

<em>&#39;Reach behind me and grab my last Silver Nail. Hide it from sight until we find a time to strike. I&#39;ll pump whatever drops of Mana I can muster into you while you lay in my arms.&#39;</em> There was still fight inside of him. Thankfully the fires in his eyes were difficult to spot without falling into his spell. <em>&#39;You can do a lot more with it than I can. I can&#39;t deliver a blow significant enough to make a difference in the condition my body is in. But you? <strong>You can take out that bastard of a Master</strong>.&#39;</em> Mutually assured destruction. A desperate and spiteful tactic.</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1140453616210165931 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1140453616210165931><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Sunday, August 13, 2023 8:15 PM">8:15 PM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><span class="chatlog__markdown-mention" style="">@r6 survivor</span></span></div></div></div></div></div>
